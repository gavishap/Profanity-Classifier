"Desde peces volviendo a los canales de Venecia hasta venados en las calles de Londres, muchas de las órdenes de aislamiento y restricciones sociales como medidas de prevención ante el coronavirus han permitido a la naturaleza volver a los lugares menos esperados. Tailandia es la nación más reciente en ocupar los titulares ante este fenómeno, después de que el gobierno de dicho país puso restricciones a los vuelos internacionales y varias medidas para que los ciudadanos se mantuvieran en sus hogares. Aunque el virus ha afectado la economía turística de Tailandia, en 2020 surgió una época de paz y salvación para las tortugas laúd. Una especie en peligro de extinción en el sudeste asiático, comenzaron a anidar allí por primera vez en cinco años. Son la especie de tortugas marinas más grandes, ahora las tortugas laúd tienen 11 nidos en las playas tailandesas, más de lo que se ha registrado en cualquier otra estación del año en las últimas dos décadas. “Esta es una muy buena señal para nosotros, porque las tortugas tienen un alto riesgo de morir a causa de los artículos de pesca y de los humanos dañando las playas.» dijo el director del centro de Biología Marina de Phuket a The Guardian. En Florida, el número de nidos de tortugas laúd ha incrementado dramáticamente desde el año pasado. La playa Juno es la ubicación con mayor densidad de nidos en todo el mundo, con un estimado de 21,000 el año anterior, número que proviene de varias especies. Con tan solo dos 2 semanas en la temporada de verano del anidación del 2020, personal del Centro de Vida Marina Loggerhead encontraron y delimitaron 76 lugares de anidación de tortugas laúd, un incremento significativo comparado con el año anterior en la longitud de 15.28km de playa. Sin perros ni personas caminando cerca o sobre los nidos, exponiendo los huevos, hay una mayor oportunidad de que los huevos sobre vivan los 60 días antes de día del nacimiento. «Nuestras tortugas laúd están viviendo con fuerza este año. Estamos emocionados de ver a nuestras tortugas prosperar en este medio ambiente,” le dijo Sarah Hirsch al noticiero WPEC-TV de West Palm Beach. “Nuestro mundo a cambiado, pero estas tortugas han estado haciendo esto por millones de años y es reconfortante y nos esperanza ver como el mundo sigue.” Para el final de la estación de anidamiento, si los números continúan incrementando, podría ser de gran ayuda para las especies vulnerables.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/enorme-en-anidacion-de-tortugasen-tailandia-y-florida/
"Un mapa interactivo en línea permite marcar la dirección de tu casa y superponer la geografía global de épocas pasadas para ver cómo ha cambiado la tierra durante 750 millones de años. Ver los resultados puede ser muy sorprendente. Hace 600 millones de años, por ejemplo, cuando la vida multicelular recién comenzaba a emerger en el océano, la capital estadounidense de Washington DC se estrelló contra la costa de África occidental como parte de una bola de tierra desordenada que se extendía hasta el Polo Sur, lo que eventualmente se separan, se alejan y forman las Américas. El proyecto, hecho con mucha dedicación por el paleontólogo Ian Webster, es una emocionante herramienta de mapas que permite a los usuarios ingresar a la mayoría de los pueblos, ciudades y países en una barra de búsqueda, donde le mostrará aproximadamente dónde se encontraba la tierra a lo largo de 750 millones de años calendario. El proyecto está adjunto a la más grande del mundo, también creada por Webster, quien se basó en datos geográficos de otro recurso llamado Tierra Antigua ( ). Creado por el paleógrafo Christopher Scotese, Ancient Earth fue la culminación de un trabajo de 30 años en desarrollo llamado Proyecto Mapas Paleo (Paleo Maps Project). La página web se muestra con una variedad de herramientas que le permiten obtener información interesante o seleccionar un período de tiempo en función de la aparición de características específicas, como la primera flor que floreció en la Tierra. Dado que Webster es un experto en dinosaurios, cualquier ubicación que ingrese en la función de búsqueda también le proporcionará una lista de dinosaurios que habrían sido sus vecinos, todos con enlaces en línea al perfil de ese dinosaurio en particular en la base de datos de Webster; en general, representa un recurso educativo increíble para niños y adultos interesados en la paleontología o la geografía. : Incluso con la tecnología GPS moderna y programas como Google Maps, los globos terráqueos y los mapas de papel bidimensionales siguen dando forma a nuestra percepción de la esfera que llamamos Tierra. Un gran ejemplo de nuestra dependencia de los mapas es la palabra china para China: «Reino Medio». Esta percepción de que China es el punto medio entre el cielo y la Tierra se refleja en los mapas chinos, donde es el Océano Pacífico el que ocupa las áreas centrales de la derecha en lugar del Atlántico, y donde Asia y África obstruyen el lado izquierdo con los otros continentes situados a la derecha. Otro ejemplo se puede encontrar en mapas fechados en la década de 1980 o antes, cuando dada la importancia del hemisferio norte para la mayoría de los estudiosos, el ecuador se colocó a 10 grados de longitud norte, haciendo que los continentes del hemisferio sur parecieran más pequeños. Ancient Earth es lo último en herramientas educativas que cambian de perspectiva, especialmente para los niños, ya que pueden ver cómo sus propios hogares se mueven en la danza tectónica que ha estado ocurriendo durante miles de millones de años. «Me sorprende que los geólogos recopilaran datos suficientes para trazar mi casa hace 750 [millones] de años, así que pensé que todos ustedes también lo disfrutarían», escribió Webster en un comentario para . “Obviamente, nunca podremos demostrar la exactitud”, concluye Webster. “En mis pruebas encontré que los resultados del modelo pueden variar significativamente. Elegí este modelo en particular porque es ampliamente citado y cubre la mayor cantidad de tiempo».",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/mapa-antiguo-de-la-tierra-te-deja-ver-su-evolucion/

"When we first partnered with our friends at Bioscarf in 2017, the Southern California wildfires making breathing hazardous in Los Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties. This scarf was the ideal solution to protect the wearer from dangerous particulate matter hanging in the air—and I got myself one (above), which I also used during the coronavirus pandemic. They now make comfortable masks, gaiters, and hoodies, too, all with incredible properties that allow for 50 washings, while still filtering the air at the N95 level or higher. It was invented by an American couple after a business trip to China, when Carlton Solle became ill, most likely due to complications related to air pollution. As an alternative to wearing ugly, unsustainable disposable masks to protect themselves, they turned to fashion. Back in Atlanta, his wife Hazel came up with the idea to design a product that would work both as a scarf and also a filter—and, in 2017, the company began sending free shipments to journalists who were out breathing the hazardous air while covering the fires—and to firefighters, too. The might be considered a genius example of wearable technology because it filters dangerous levels of toxic particulates, but it uses no gadgets, processors, or batteries. And, the best part is their filtration technology can be washed up to 100 times without losing its N95 rating. ( ) 3 layers of protection in their debut model guarded against hazardous contaminants that pose a health risk—including, according to the company, many of the bacteria and germs that cause colds and viruses (frequent flyers, take note). With its U.S. rating of N95, the generously sized scarf (as well as their newer gator and face mask) is capable of blocking 99.75% of all particles 0.1 microns in size or larger—and 95% of all non-oil based airborne particles measuring 0.3 microns. A “first of its kind”, these personal protective apparel items in olive, black, and white—made from sustainably constructed recycled materials. The plush polyester blend uses 100% post-consumer recycled PET water bottles, and customer satisfaction is guaranteed. By November of 2017, at the time of the Thomas Fire, the new company has already donated more than a thousand scarves in the U.S. to people in fire zones and elsewhere, and to friends in China where approximately 1.6 million people die prematurely every year due to poor air quality. Fast forward to 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began. I got in touch with Carlton and learned that they had added a variety of new products. Most notably, a line of cold weather gaiters, as well as summer scarves and gaiters made of hemp. They also added a pullover with built-in face mask, a hoodie which protects the entire upper body except the eyes, and a reusable, washable face mask, perfect for healthcare workers, which is less costly than the scarves or gaiters, retailing for just $29. With the recent addition of a nano-fiber layer, these new products can be washed 50 times before they even begin to degrade in the slightest. They can be washed 100 times and still be rated the equivalent of an N95, because their filtration technology is, as Carlton told me, “like N95 on steroids”. Similar masks are made for frontline workers, which you can . They include 1″ elastic bands in a specially designed strap system for secure fit and comfort all day—and they are reusable and washable up to 100 times, effectively replacing one million single-use disposable face masks. They feature a rugged exterior fabric that is water-resistant and anti-bacterial, too. The company, G95, is currently shipping their products within 1-2 days for FREE—using USPS Priority Mail in the US—and they now ship over $100 FREE via UPS. If you enter the code GNN20 at checkout you will get a any order over $100. “Anyone who is seeking a fashionable and functional scarf or other clothing item to protect themselves–or loved ones, and is interested in helping to turn the tide on sicknesses around the world, should ,” Hazel Solle told GNN. So now, besides being a perfect apparel piece for anyone who bicycles in the city, works around vehicles, regularly travels in airplanes or buses, or simply lives in a smoggy region, people can protect themselves from the COVID-19 virus. One customer wrote a review in October 2020 saying, “This is one of the BEST investments I ever made! I have the Basic Mask. I never, ever thought I would need it for anything except the virus. However, there was a fire nearby in the mountains surrounding Mt. St. Helens and the air quality was the worst in the world! It rated a Hazard for almost a week. I wore this Amazing mask 24/7 inside my home for almost five days. (I am 71 and guided to stay inside). Every time I took it off to eat or drink water, I could smell smoke inside my home, even with the great air purifier running 24/7—I easily slept with it on!” Another wrote, “These people rock with great customer service, too. Thanks so much for a Wonderful Product! It certainly worked for me.” For more information, visit their .

"We felt like we were being serenaded with kindness when we learned that in the Netherlands and Belgium there are official ‘City Poets’ who brighten otherwise lonely funerals. Akin to a town crier, or some other mainstay of a Middle Ages-set period piece, the City Poet has only been an official position since the turn of the 21st century. As quaint is it may seem, the job is a serious one, for upon his or her shoulders rests the responsibility for composing funerary poems for those who die anonymously, unclaimed by friends or family. In an exploration of the Lonely Funeral Foundation, a collective of poets that work to ensure every individual who falls through the cracks of Dutch society has some kind of memorial service, published on the , Boston, the reader learns of a stark yet moving tradition that is both modern and rustic, and speaks to the responsibility of a society in the 21st century. A City Poet is as “a remunerated professional with clear job requirements and term duration. He or she is usually appointed by the City Council for a limited time with the objective of writing poems about the city they come from—for the good and the bad times, but also for regular or random events, official occasions and ceremonies, with the objective to inform and entertain the citizens.” The Lonely Funerals concept was put forward by one such City Poet—Bart Droog of Groningen, in 2001, after which it spread to other Dutch cities and to those in Belgium, another country that started the City Poet idea around the same years. In Amsterdam, where a dozen people might die unclaimed per year, the City Poet has to, at a moment’s notice, be ready to transform himself from artist to sleuth. Details about these people can often be scant—presenting a huge challenge to someone trying to write a poem, much less one in memory of a life. The City Poet must be ready to collect records of lodging, employment, and immigration, or talk to neighbors and others that might have interacted with the person. There is a simple prize for a yearly contest to see which poet composed the most moving lonely funeral poem, organized by Ger Fritz, a former employee of the Amsterdam Department of Funerals, and one of the originators of the concept. “People are story machines… What the Lonely Funeral does is return stories to people who have somehow lost theirs along the way,” an Amsterdam poet Frank Starik, told the Ploughshares Blog. Also speaking with , poet Hester Knibbe remarked at the difficulty of the job: “How do you write a poem about someone you don’t know anything about… ? It’s like a word that just won’t come: you describe, you try to imagine a basic life, trying to force it into some highs and lows.” Sometimes details are so scant, the poets must fight the urge to fill in gaps with recognizable themes from literature or from the poet’s own life. Pioneer Droog refers to the Lonely Funeral Foundation as the “social task of the poet,” and indeed it’s considered a vital civil service akin to social insurance or other benefits; that through honoring those the society let down, those who remain can perhaps work to better it.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/city-poets-in-belgium-and-holland-are-responsible-for-writing-poems-for-unclaimed-dead/
"A research team at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences has identified a potential cause of long-lasting symptoms experienced by COVID-19 patients, often referred to as ‘long-haulers’. At the heart of the team’s findings is an antibody that shows up weeks after an initial infection and attacks and disrupts a key regulator of the immune system, said lead researcher John Arthur, M.D., Ph.D., professor and chief of the Division of Nephrology in the UAMS College of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine. As many as 30% of COVID-19 patients experience lingering fatigue, brain fog and shortness of breath. The cause of long COVID-19 has eluded scientists, but the UAMS team’s discovery sheds important new light on the molecular-level mechanisms behind it. “Everything that we’ve found is consistent with this antibody as the instigator of long COVID, so it’s an exciting development,” Dr. Arthur said. The antibody creates problems for the immune system by attacking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The ACE2 enzyme helps regulate the body’s response to the virus by metabolizing a peptide that activates the immune system. The attacking antibody interferes with ACE2’s work, which makes the antibody a prime suspect for the long-lasting illness. : The multidisciplinary research team was brought together quickly this spring to test the hypothesis that developed through discussions between Arthur and UAMS’ Terry Harville, M.D., Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Pathology and medical director of the Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Laboratories. Researchers tested plasma or serum for ACE2 antibodies in 67 patients in Arkansas and Oklahoma with known SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and 13 with no history of infection. In 81% of blood samples from patients with a history of COVID-19, the samples had the antibody that attacked the ACE2. In participants with no history of COVID-19, no antibodies were created to attack the ACE2 enzyme. “If we show that the whole hypothesis is right, that this interference of ACE2 really does cause long COVID, then it opens up many potential treatments,” . “There are medications that should work to treat them.” : The next step would be to test the drugs that might relieve the symptoms people are having.

"Have you ever wanted to live on a farm, but without having to do all the hard work or needing to drive an hour to reach a major city? In San Francisco, a mixed-income apartment complex has gone up in the neighborhood of Santa Clara that comes with its own 1.5 acre farm, managed by a professional urban farming company, which also welcomes help from residents. The Agrihood building consists of 361 units, 181 of which are priced below market rate— 10% are reserved for moderate income renters, and 165 for low-income seniors and veterans. The complex also contains 30 townhomes and features a central 1.5 acre organic farm that can produce 20,000 pounds of food every year. Each week the produce is brought to an on-site location and sold at a deep discount for residents. The full list of produce is , and includes superfoods, comfort foods, orchards, perennial foods, and native foods. “Our goal throughout this endeavor has been to provide the affordable housing that we urgently need in Santa Clara through a truly creative, community-driven process,” writes the brochure. : “Not only are we providing a really unique living experience for the residents that live on the property, but we’re also taking a very deliberate approach to encouraging the health and wellness of our residents by incorporating the farm, hopefully, into their daily and weekly lifestyles,” Vince Cantore, who is vice-president of Core Companies, the firm leading the Agrihood project, told . Attempting to address the housing shortage in San Francisco, Agrihood is actually built on the site of what used to be one of the many orchards that covered Santa Clara in decades past. : Urban farming and gardening is growing in popularity, with some cities, parks, or neighborhoods attempting to include community gardens, , or into development plans. It’s a critical way that urban areas can increase food security, reduce the carbon footprint that food racks up during transportation, and increase access to healthy food for low-income communities in food deserts. :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/in-san-francisco-a-361-unit-apartment-complex-comes-with-farm/
"As a little boy, Nick Priest loved playing video games with his dad, Joe, who was a wiz at all things tech and gaming. They started off with Nick holding a controller and pretending to play, and moved on to Lego games and Mario Galaxy. Joe was diagnosed with cancer when Nick was three, and after that, they played more than ever. The last time he made it down to the basement for gaming, Joe was so weak that he couldn’t even walk—he had to go down the stairs, step by step, on his rear end—but it was worth it and the pair had a blast. When he passed away, Nick was just six, but the boy didn’t just lose his dad, he lost his gaming partner. When friends or family would visit and play with him, it took his mind off his sadness and brought back happy memories of playing. Nick told his mom then that no kid should ever be without someone to play video games with. That’s when the was born. He started working on the project as a freshman in high school, at Salesianum School Wilmington, Delaware. Now a junior, he rallies teens to bring the “power of play” (particularly video games) to kids who are affected by cancer or other illnesses At first, Nick recruited volunteers to go to the local children’s hospital, Alfred I. Dupont Hospital for Children, to play games with kids one-on-one. Then COVID-19 hit, making in-person events impossible. Determined to keep going, he raised $1,000 that he used to buy 2 Playstation 4 gaming systems and a few controllers. Then, he interviewed a girl who had gone through childhood cancer and her mom, and they told him how isolating and lonely cancer treatment can be, even before COVID. Nick learned that kids in treatment are often unable to leave their rooms or are in isolation rooms, meaning even if there were a gaming system to play, there wasn’t anyone to play with. And although most of these young patients have phones and tablets, they usually aren’t allowed to use the hospital’s WIFI to link up with each other to stream and play. : He brainstormed to find a way his volunteers could play with kids online and a way that kids in the hospital could play with each other. He told hospital officials about his idea, and together, they developed a system where the kids on a floor can communicate with each other while playing. “Hospitals have a lot of privacy laws and regulations,” Nick told GNN, “It took a long time but we finally got there!” “No, video games do not cure any disease, but as my dad always used to say, ‘Laughter is the best medicine!’” : The team also helps those who have parents or siblings that are going through something tough. Realizing that there were kids who weren’t in the hospital but still could benefit from playing video games, Nick and his NPOP volunteers developed a Buddy System. Parents reach out to NPOP and share the games their child likes and other interests, and then Nick assigns one of his teen volunteers—like Kylie or Jack who are both officers in the project (pictured above)—to be a buddy, based on their interests. For example, he buddied up a kid who loved football with a varsity football player. : The kids and their buddies decide how often and when to play, but usually it is once every week or so. They log in and compete with each other and talk, just connecting and having fun. The kids and buddies are really enjoying it, so NPOP really wants to expand and reach as many kids as they can. Currently, they have more volunteers than kids who want to play, because so many teens want to help. Nick asked GNN to encourage readers to reach out, if they have a child or teen who could benefit from a gaming buddy, and to spread the word to anyone who NPOP may be able to help. NPOP’s website is and from there, parents can email and get the buddy process started. “If I can bring smiles to children’s faces, and bring laughter into their hospital rooms, I will do whatever it takes to make that happen.” : Nick told GNN that he is “very close” to getting his 501c3 nonprofit finalized, but he did set up a for anyone who wishes to contribute to the purchase of more controllers and gaming systems.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/teens-bring-power-of-play-to-kids-in-hospital/
"12-year-old Wanessa Bąkowska has been pouring her sensitivity through paints and onto canvas since she adopted as a little girl with Down syndrome. From Lipka, Poland, the 6th grade student has also been enchanted with all things royal, and recently decided to make a painting for the queen. With her tutor’s help in translating to English, she wrote a letter and sent it off to the palace: “Your Majesty, my name is Wanessa and I am 12 years old. I live in Poland, in the small town of Lipka. “I have wonderful teachers and many friends. I have mum Karolina, dad Rafał, brother Alan and sister Nutka. I love them very much. “I am a person with a disability and Down Syndrome. Nevertheless, I paint pictures. I would like to give you one of them, Your Majesty. The title of this painting is ‘Earth’. Greetings from Poland.” She posted on Facebook about sending the painting, saying in Polish: “I like breaking stereotypes and I like to pretend to myself that the impossible doesn’t exist… Although in real life I will not have such an opportunity, I visited the royal court through a letter I wrote to Queen Elizabeth… Beloved dreams are there to make them come true, even if they seem unreal.” : Well, the ‘unreal’ did come true on September 6, as they received a reply from the royal court in their mailbox. The Queen’s response, dictated by an assistant, spoke of how ‘touched’ she was with the effort she put into the painting, describing it as “splendid”. : The letter said Her Majesty was thankful to the 12-year-old for her “thoughtfulness for taking the time to write” and wished her success in the future. Pictures of the official reply was posted to her daughter’s with the words, “Dreams are made to be fulfilled. Today I got a reply to my letter from Queen Elizabeth.” Her mom shares the canvases from her talented young daughter to social media at ‘Pictures Painted With Heart’ ( ), which has over 2000 followers. There you can see details about how Wanessa uses every day objects, like plastic cups, balloons, beads, and plastic wrap, to move paint in unique and ethereal ways. She’s creating more complex and beautiful works every week. In fact, the Labirynt gallery in Pila hosted an exhibition of her works and one of her paintings was even shown in the National Theatre in Warsaw last year. “We didn’t expect an answer. Nobody was set on it,” Karolina Bąkowska told the Polish news outlet, Fakt. “Regardless of whether the lady of the court responded to it on behalf of the queen, or someone else, it was a huge surprise for us, and above all for Wanessa.” :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/polish-artist-with-down-syndrome-gets-note-from-queen/
"In order to cut back on the conflicts between humans and elephants, Chinese wildlife authorities have constructed a massive “food court” along established elephant migratory routes. Stocked with five salty ponds, and many different kinds of plants that can satisfy their dietary needs, the elephant food court of Jinghong Nature Reserve spans 670,000 square meters, the same size as Porche’s Stuttgart car assembly plant, or around 62 European football fields. Elephants roam vast distances every year, whether they live in China, India, or Africa. They have no concept of land ownership or borders, and can often bring economic ruin to any unlucky farmer whose fields are close at hand when an elephant determines it’s time for lunch. Since the end of the last century, Asian elephants in Jinghong have enjoyed protected status, and in number from 85 to 185. This has led to greater conflict with locals during migrations. The food court was started last December and finished in May, and its position in a national forest reserve was cleverly selected to ensure they would pass it every year during migration. The “food base,” or “dining hall” as Cha Wei, deputy director of Jinghong Reserve, described it is meant to eliminate the need for the pachyderms to raid nearby farms. “If provided with enough food, the elephants will not break into villages and croplands to forage, which can help resolve conflicts between local people and wild elephants,” Mr. Cha was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency.

"Leaded gas, one of our species’ great pollutants, is no longer made or used. The last country which sold leaded gasoline, Algeria, ceased to do so this month, 41 years after the first country—Japan—made the decision. It was in the early days of the automobile’s ascension that gasoline producers began to add different chemicals to prevent damage to the interiors of their engines. Lead quickly began to represent the superior choice, which over the next 80 years was shot out through the exhaust pipes of cars around the world. U.S. researchers of lead’s toxic effects by the time the EPA was created in 1973, at which time the U.S. began a 25-year phase out. Japan only needed seven years following those initial reports to ban leaded gas, with Austria, Canada, Slovakia, Denmark, and Sweden following shortly after. The U.S. and UK finally removed leaded gas in the late ’90s, after which most countries followed. “The elimination of lead from gas is one of the great environmental achievements of all time,” Carol Browner, administrator of the EPA . “Thousands of tons of lead have been removed from the air, and blood levels of lead in our children are down 70 percent. This means that millions of children will be spared the painful consequences of lead poisoning, such as permanent nerve damage, anemia or mental retardation.” Indeed the global ban is projected to prevent 1.2 million premature deaths worldwide, and save a total of $2.4 trillion in medical costs for treating lead poisoning, which can damage pretty much every major system in the human body. A detailed summary of the leaded-gas story, , claims it took 10 years after the turn of the millennium to convince 107 countries to ban it, but 10 more years to convince the holdouts. By 2016, only the war-ravaged nations of Iraq and Yemen, and the last major exporter, Algeria, were left. “The successful enforcement of the ban on leaded petrol is a huge milestone for global health and our environment,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN environment program. “Overcoming a century of deaths and illnesses that affected hundreds of millions and degraded the environment worldwide, we are invigorated to change humanity’s trajectory for the better through an accelerated transition to clean vehicles and electric mobility.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/after-four-decades-of-advocacy-all-the-world-bans-leaded-gasoline/
"In response to global warming concerns across the planet, the world’s largest beef exporter has approved the sale of a feed additive that cuts methane emissions from beef and dairy cattle. Regulators in Brazil and Chile have granted full market authorization for Royal DSM’s Bovaer to be given to cows as well as sheep and goats, the company said recently in a statement. The methane-reducing additive obtained this first approval after a 10-year collaboration called Project Clean Cow, and its success in on farms in 13 countries across 4 continents—peer-reviewed studies (such as at UC Davis) that were published in scientific journals “A beef trial with Bovaer at Sao Paolo State University (UNESP) in Brazil conducted in 2016-2017, showed enteric methane emission reductions up to 55%, which highlights the potential for radically more sustainable cattle farming in Latin America to further lower their carbon footprint,” said Mauricio Adade, president DSM Latin America. : And the additive comes “without adverse effects on performance”, says São Paulo State University Professor Ricardo Reis. ”The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) stated that a rapid reduction of methane emissions could reduce the spread of global warming in the near term and have a positive effect on air quality,” s Mark van Nieuwland. “We know the agricultural and livestock sectors recognize this opportunity for change and are eager to act.” Just a quarter teaspoon of Bovaer per cow per day consistently reduces burped methane emission by approximately 30% for dairy cows and even higher percentages (up till 90%) for beef cows. After suppressing methane production in the stomach, it is broken down into compounds already naturally present in the cow’s stomach. :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bovaer-approved-for-feed-additive-in-brazil-chile/
"In a Finnish collaborative study, researchers noticed that standing is associated with better insulin sensitivity. Increasing the daily standing time may therefore help prevent chronic diseases. Insulin is a key hormone in energy metabolism and blood sugar regulation. Normal insulin function in the body may be disturbed by, for example, being overweight, leading to decreased insulin sensitivity and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Type 2 diabetes is one the most common lifestyle diseases worldwide, and its onset is usually preceded by impaired insulin sensitivity, or insulin resistance. This refers to a state in which the body does not react to insulin normally, and the blood glucose levels rise. Lifestyle has a strong impact on insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes, and regular physical activity is known to have an important role in the prevention of these issues. However, so far, little is known about the impact of sedentary behaviour, breaks in sitting, and standing on insulin resistance. In a study of Turku PET Centre and UKK institute, the researchers investigated the associations between insulin resistance and sedentary behaviour, physical activity and fitness in inactive working-age adults with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. In the study, the researchers observed that standing is associated with better insulin sensitivity independently of the amount of daily physical activity or sitting time, fitness level, or being overweight. “This association has not been shown before. These findings further encourage replacing a part of daily sitting time with standing, especially if physical activity recommendations are not met,” says Doctoral Candidate Taru Garthwaite from the University of Turku. The study also emphasizes the importance of healthy body composition on metabolic health. The results show that increased body fat percentage was a more important factor in terms of insulin sensitivity than physical activity, fitness, or the amount of time spent sitting. Standing, on the other hand, was associated with insulin sensitivity independently, irrespective of body composition. “Regular exercise is well known to be beneficial for health. It seems that physical activity, fitness, and sedentary behaviour are also connected to insulin metabolism, but indirectly, through their effect on body composition,” Taru Garthwaite explains. Causal effects cannot yet be predicted based on this study, published in , but according to Garthwaite, the results suggest that increasing daily standing time may help in prevention of lifestyle diseases if physical activity recommendations are not met. Next, the researchers aim to investigate how changes in daily activity and sedentariness impact cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk factors and metabolism by comparing two groups in an intervention study of a longer duration. “Our aim is to study if reducing daily sitting time by an hour has an impact on energy metabolism and fat accumulation in liver and the whole body, for example, in addition to insulin sensitivity and blood sugar regulation,” says Garthwaite.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/turku-university-standing-improved-insulin/
"In the wake of Hurricane Ida’s devastating toll on New Orleans, the people of Houston are opening their Texas-sized hearts and providing Texas-sized relief to refugees. Not only are they sending trucks full of supplies, they’re opening their doors to provide beds for the displaced, including inside the massive Lakewood Church. And, once again, Gallery Furniture’s “Mattress Mack”—Jim McIngvale— —is leading the charge, and initiating his own collection drive. “We did it during Katrina and, you know, people need a place to stay. They’ve been disrupted from their homes by this terrible hurricane, so it’s the least we can do. We’ve got lots of mattresses, lots of sofas and anybody needs a place to stay, come out to Gallery Furniture,” McIngvale told . “It’s just the right thing to do.” Any evacuee with a Louisiana ID will be offered shelter in the store. And, while Houstonians arrive hourly with cars full of supplies to send to Louisiana, McIngvale is scouting a location for a distribution warehouse from which to disperse the truckloads of relief supplies once they arrive. Donations can be dropped off at the Gallery Furniture 6006 N. Freeway location through Wednesday, September 1st until 5:30 p.m. The items most needed are: Non-Perishable Food, Bottled Water, Diapers, Baby wipes, Pet Food, Soap, Toothpaste, Toothbrushes, Deodorant, Hairbrushes, Shampoo, Feminine care products, Socks, Books, games, puzzles, and activities for families with children. Houston’s Lakewood Church was also holding a 2-day collection drive that ended today, and has opened its doors to offer shelter for those who fled the hurricane. “We are preparing to help the people coming from New Orleans and Louisiana… We want them to know that Lakewood is open if they need a place to stay. We’ll accommodate as many as we can safely,” Pastor Joel Osteen told . The Houston Astros Foundation is also hosting an emergency drive at Minute Maid Park from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Wednesday and Thursday, with all donations being shipped directly to Louisiana communities impacted by the storm.

"If only plants could talk, what tidings they could share! Fortunately for farmers, an agricultural company has ‘translated’ the biochemical signal related to certain plant behavior, allowing them to ‘listen’ to plants cries for water when they’re thirsty. It has the capacity to reduce water use in any system, from a well-manicured lawn to a rural vegetable farm in North Africa, and compared to drip irrigation which is based on a similar idea, it can reduce water use by 30-50%, revolutionizing the science and methods of irrigation in the face of a warming climate, longer droughts, and water shortages. (DRI) has designed a watering system that installs tubes under the earth filled with pore-like depressions. As plants begin to get thirsty they produce a certain chemical in their roots. The micropores in the tubes in turn detect this chemical and release a water drip that will continue until it detects the plants have drunk their fill. In , farmers are growing vegetables in the desert, and DRI won the startup of the year 2019 at the Global Forum for Innovations in Agriculture, while in Pakistan near the dry vegetables like tomatoes and bok choy were grown 81% faster and twice as large, respectively, than with regular drip irrigation. In fact, DRI is established in 14 countries, from rural Zimbabwe to lawns in Utah and Los Angeles in the U.S. The biggest hurdle stopping RDI from changing the industry is that existing methods of irrigation are already established and paid for. Convincing farmers to make the switch could be difficult, especially in certain areas, like California, where the irrigation systems have not only been around for decades, but link multiple farms and orchards like a spider’s web. Yet “wherever there’s an issue with water scarcity and food security, we want to be there,” Jan Gould, founder of Responsive Drip Irrigation, told",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/responsive-drip-irrigation-system-changes-agriculture-saves-30-50-water-costs/
"The youngest winner of one of the world’s most prestigious music competitions can’t claim her prize—playing piano at Carnegie Hall—because she’s too young to get the vaccine. Four-year-old Brigitte Xie only started playing piano a year ago in lockdown, but instantly revealed a talent for music. The pint-sized prodigy can read music and play a note-perfect rendition of Beethoven’s Sonatina in F Major—her feet dangling far above the pedals. She won the Elite National Music Competition last December, and then in March this year won first place at the American Protégé International Competition, which wins her an invitation to perform at world-renowned music venue Carnegie Hall in New York City this November where all performers are required to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Pre-schooler Brigitte was forced to pull out – but will be given anther chance at a future concert in 2022. Her mother, Nicole Sun from Ridgefield, Connecticut said, “She doesn’t know much to be honest; I tell her ‘yeah baby you won the prize’ and she was like ‘ok, can we go to Disney store now?’ “I tell her ‘you’re going to perform in front of many people’ and she seemed excited because she likes performing.” A pianist herself, Nicole took the opportunity to introduce her daughter to it while under lockdown last year to keep her entertained. But even though she’s showing a prodigious talent, her mom is not going to push it on her. “As a parent I’m still open to everything, I don’t tell her that she must be a pianist. Whatever she wants to be is fine.” Her daughter began playing piano at age three during the lockdown, and when her mom couldn’t keep up with lessons, she found an online tutor, Felicia Feng Zhang. The little musician “picked up more in six months than most do in years worth of lessons”. She quickly learned to read sheet music and sight read classical pieces, and eventually started attending in-person lessons with Felicia in Greenwich, Connecticut, who urged her to enter competitions. : Her mom didn’t know, at this young age, that Brigitte could follow instructions and play the pieces. “Before the media approached me I thought she was just one of the normal students.” Brigitte passed her Royal College of Music Level 1 exam before her 4th birthday in May with a first class mark of 86. She practices for just 45 minutes a day, and has one half-hour lesson a week, but neither Nicole or dad, Tao Xie, have to nag her, as she’ll wander over herself. : The tinkling tot wants to perform Mozart when she eventually takes the stage— and, had she been able to perform this year, would potentially have been the youngest ever to play on Carnegie Hall.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/4-yo-learned-piano-during-lockdown-wins-elite-competition/
"“To invent,” Thomas Edison said, “you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.” Colrerd Nkosi had all the junk he needed—and the will to bring electricity to his small village in Malawi—and he not only accomplished his goal, but won an award from the Queen of England. Using a repurposed corn-shelling machine motor and a fast-moving river, Nkosi created an electric turbine that’s now lighting up homes for him and his neighbors for free in the town of Mzimba. Just like Edison, he did a lot of experimenting. In the beginning, he put a bicycle in the river and brainstormed about how the current moved the pedals, and how it might be turned into power. Then, he used an old refrigerator compressor that converted power for 6 homes. His neighbors were clamoring, so he continued to upgrade. According to the self-taught inventor, his latest turbine has the potential to produce enough power to provide electricity to 1,000 homes and says another turbine can be installed downstream to expand the grid. ( ) The hydro power has the added benefit of lessening deforestation by negating the necessity for locals to cut down trees in order to obtain charcoal. In a country where only 11% of the population has access to electricity, having a reliable and renewable source of energy has been a game-changer—especially in the schools. “In the past, we had to study by candlelight and whenever there was no money to buy candles, we could not study,” student Gift Mfune . “Now that we have access to electricity, many more of us will pass our exams.” The driving force behind Nkosi’s DIY power initiative (known as the Kasangazi Hydro-Electrical Power Plant) is not profit. Indeed, the only charge for his service is a €1 per month maintenance fee. Over 2,000 people have benefitted from his sustainable and locally generated electricity, and in 2018, Mr. Nkosi won a Point Of Light Award from Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II for his dedication to innovation. In addition to bringing light to his neighbors literally, Nkosi’s dream is to bring enlightenment to them as well—through education. Nkosi already gives hands-on lessons in the basics of carpentry and engineering to village children, and fervently hopes to expand his own skillset with more advanced studies. “I wish I could find a sponsor to help me fulfill my plan of going back to school to further my knowledge and pass on what I’ve learned to others,” he said during his .

"We all know that recycling is good for the planet in the long run, but now, in a more immediate way, it’s also being used to save lives as plastic waste is being transformed into PPE for workers on the frontlines of the pandemic. At Thai Taffeta, a textile factory near Bangkok, Thailand, a mountain of discarded plastic bottles has been broken down into filaments which are then woven into a water-resistant fabric used to make personal protective equipment (PPE) suits. In addition to the PPE designated for hospitals, the safeguarding outfits are also being distributed to non-medical personnel at high risk for exposure to the virus. A good portion of the fabric—dyed in the sect’s iconic red-orange hue—has been sent to Thailand’s Buddhist temples, where monks are overseeing the cremation of coronavirus victims. “There are times where it is very difficult to get hold of PPE suits, sometimes even if you have money, you can’t buy [them],” Abbot Phra Maha Pranom Dhammalangkaro of Samut Prakan province’s Chakdaeng temple explained to Reuters. It takes approximately 18 bottles to make each PPE suit. An estimated 18 million bottles have been collected and recycled thus far. “We’re saving lives and the environment as well,” Thai Taffeta’s head of sales and marketing Arnuphap Chompuming told Reuters—which just goes to show that what’s good for the people is what’s good for the planet—and vice-versa. the video about this story from Reuters below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/thailand-covid-19-ppe-upcycled-bottles/

"There are several “great walls” in the world, but in this very moment, none are greater than the “Great Wall of Louisiana,” the rebuilt-levees which just passed their first test as Hurricane Ida hit Eastern U.S. and parts of the Gulf Coast. The 1.8 mile-long, $1.3 billion storm surge barrier along Lake Borgne is the largest civil-works construction project in the history of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, built eight years after Katrina. Storms and two hurricanes have pressed the levees and other defense systems, but Ida is the first one to rival Katrina in fury. As one of the most powerful storms to hit the state since the 1850s, according to National Geographic, it was the moment that hundreds of contingency planners, and millions of residents were waiting for. Would the levees hold? “There is no catastrophic flooding in New Orleans,” Rene Poche, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers. “The system performed the way it was supposed to. That’s a big deal.” Of course, saying “the levees” is to insinuate that defenses like the Great Wall are the only things that stand between Bourbon Street and obliteration, but the wall is only a glorious centerpiece in a network of systems designed to dampen storm surges and funnel rainwater out of the area. For example, of the several that were build in the interlude between Katrina and Ida, the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway West Closure Complex is the . Built of 1,071 pilings measuring 225 feet-long and 26 feet-high, it would be capable of filling an Olympic swimming pool in an astonishing four seconds. Together, the wall and the pump are the first line of defense for preventing Lake Borgne, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway from inundating New Orleans, New Orleans East, the Ninth Ward, Gentilly, and St. Bernard Parish with flood waters. An additional 192 miles of levees and floodwalls, 3,530 acres of levee turf, and 244 land-based floodgates have been constructed with $14.5 billion of government money that has poured into Louisiana since Katrina. Several other very impressive structures, like the Seabrook Floodgate Complex, featuring two 220-ton gates and a 600 foot-long wall, fortify the areas further afield from New Orleans, but the systems are now being supported by greener defenses. The Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a man-made channel which exposed the freshwater marshlands in the delta there to toxic levels of salinity, has been closed, bringing historical salinity levels back to over a million acres of coastal habitat. “This means that the basin will be able to support a variety of species, ranging from cypress trees to oysters, while work is done to restore the vital storm surge buffer that forested wetlands and marshes provide nearby communities, including the Lower 9th Ward and St. Bernard Parish,” writes the non-profit America doesn’t always have the best track record of learning from the mistakes of the past, but at least in Louisiana the lessons of Katrina were well-taken, and hopefully we’ll see many storms like Ida succeed only in the huffing and puffing stages, without ever blowing the levees down.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-new-orleans-levees-held-for-the-first-katrina-level-storm-since-being-rebuilt/
"On Sept. 11, 2001, 66 men and women who worked for the investment banking firm Sandler O’Neill & Partners on the 104th floor in the World Trade Center lost their lives. In the harrowing days following the terrorist attacks, the company made the decision to set up a foundation to pay college tuition for all the 76 children of their fallen colleagues. I called the Sandler O’Neill Foundation the other day to talk about those children, and learned that 54 young men and women have had their college tuition paid so far, with 22 young men and women still eligible. The 54 who are now attending or have attended college have gone to every sort of school imaginable — from Stanford to Notre Dame to community colleges and technical institutes. Four students have attended Boston College, the alma mater of Welles Crowther, the 24-year-old Sandler O’Neill employee who saved as many as 12 people in the south tower before running back upstairs to save more people and never being seen again. The youngest child eligible was born six weeks after September 11. When that child graduates from college, the Sandler O’Neill Foundation will cease to exist, except in memory; but what a resounding memory it will be. Andy Armstrong was one of the founders of the foundation. Though he did not work for Sandler O’Neill, he was a friend of Sandler’s surviving partner, Jimmy Dunne. He and others of Dunne’s friends and colleagues – as well as banking competitors – helped set up and endow the foundation. “We were up and running by the end of the first week,” Armstrong says. “We wanted the families of the lost to know that we would always remember, that the passing years would never sweep this under the rug. People donated many millions of dollars to set up the foundation. We have no salaries and no expenses except fees to stay extant.” “I know most of the children who went to college. You wouldn’t believe some of the letters they have written in appreciation. I think they particularly appreciate that we remember their mom or dad this way. Many of them hardly knew their moms and dads.” I called Jimmy Dunne at Sandler O’Neill to ask him why he instantly did so very much the right thing, the extraordinary thing, when it would have been so easy and normal and understandable to just do enough. “Because there was a moment in time to stand up,” Dunne says, bluntly. “Because we believed that what we did would echo for a hundred years in the families of our people, their kids and their grandkids. Because how we conducted ourselves in those first few hours and days would define who we really were and what we were about.” “Because I knew that if we were not honorable, then we stood for nothing. I concluding immediately that we would not be intimidated, we would not go out of business, we will come back stronger than ever, and be an example of people who worked and lived with honor. And that meant taking care of our people and their children with respect and reverence. So we did that.” “We figured what we did and how we did it was our way of fighting idiots like bin Laden. You want us to fall apart? Then we will survive and flourish. You want to destroy us? Then we will insist even more on acting with honor. That’s what the foundation was for, is for. We want our defiance and reverence to echo for a century, so that the grandchildren of our people will know we stood for something, and acted honorably when it really counted.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bank-that-lost-66-workers-on-911-has-paid-for-kids-college/
"The “world’s largest” factory built solely for the purpose of drawing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it, has just come online in Iceland. Built in the geothermal park in Hellisheidi, the company hopes this is merely a stepping stone necessary to scale up the model by a factor of 80, and thereby remove millions of tons of CO2 by the end of the decade. As direct a climate solution as there could be, the , just one of a number of climate change solutions offered by the Icelandic firm Carbfix, takes CO2 from the air before separating the carbon from the oxygen, mixing it with water and sending it deep underground into basalt rock formations where it mineralizes. With 16 locations recycling CO2, Climeworks, the Swiss company which provided Orca with the CO2 intake fans, are extremely excited to have participated in a project that will permanently remove carbon, rather than just recycling it. the green technology can be reproduced easily, and to scale, anywhere there is renewable energy and storage available. Orca was built adjacent to a local geothermal power plant, so it runs fully on renewable energy. : The company says it can pull 4,000 tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere every year, the equivalent of taking 870 cars off the road. On its own, it’s a small impact for the $10-15 million it takes to build, but as companies are increasingly pressured to provide carbon offsets for their operations, the technology offers a huge appeal if costs come down and production is boosted. For example, offsetting emissions by planting trees is great, but it takes 50 years for a tree to gather enough CO2 to actually sequester it. If the tree dies before that period, it’s as if the company did nothing. : A Canadian company, , which has received $25 million in funding from the government, is building a technology that directly captures CO2 from the air and stores it as compressed gas, or creates a near-carbon-neutral fuel. They are currently building what they call the world’s largest direct air capture plant in the southwestern US that, when operational, will remove more than 1 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year, about the same as 40 million mature trees. But for Carbfix, knowing the carbon is stored deep underground where it won’t emerge for hundreds of millions of years is the most verifiable way of demonstrating their commitment to addressing the climate crisis. :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/iceland-builds-a-factory-to-bury-co2-in-rock/

He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Between 37 and 41 BCE, Virgo-born served as third Emperor of Rome. To do so, he had to disprove the prophecy of a renowned astrologer, Thrasyllus of Mendes. Years earlier, Thrasyllus had predicted that Caligula, despite being well-connected, “had no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Bay of Baiae”—a distance of two miles. Once in power, Caligula arranged to have a series of pontoon boats arrayed across the bay, enabling him to ride his favorite horse Incitatus from one shore to the other across the Bay of Baiae. I foresee the possibility of a comparable turn of events for you, Virgo. Is there a curse you want to undo? A false prophecy you’d like to cancel? Someone’s low expectation you would love to debunk? The coming weeks will be a favorable time. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): College student Amelia Hamrick studied the right panel of Hieronymus Bosch’s 15th-century painting . It depicts a hellish scene. Cities are on fire. Weird beasts devour sinful humans. There are demons and torture chambers. Hamrick did what no one in the history of art had ever done: She transcribed the musical score that the artist had written on a man’s naked hindquarters. Her work inspired a composer to create a recording entitled “500-Year-Old Butt Song from Hell.” In the coming weeks, I invite you to perform feats comparable to Hamrick: 1. Explore the past for useful, overlooked clues. 2. Find or create redemptive transformations out of stressful situations. 3. Have fun telling stories about your past misadventures. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Born on one of the Galapagos Islands, Diego is a giant tortoise who has lived for over 100 years. He’s a member of a species that had dwindled to a population of 15 by 1977. That’s when he and his tortoise colleague, whose name is E5, became part of a breeding program with 12 female tortoises. E5 was reserved in his behavior, but Diego was a showboat who vocalized loudly as he enjoyed public mating rituals. Together —producing over 2,000 offspring in subsequent years. According to my astrological analysis, you could be as metaphorically fertile as Diego and E5 in the coming months—even if you prefer to adopt an approach more akin to E5’s. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): “The meaning of my existence is that life has addressed a question to me,” wrote psychologist . “Or, conversely, I myself am a question that is addressed to the world, and I must communicate my answer, for otherwise, I am dependent upon the world’s answer.” These are superb meditations for you Sagittarians during the coming weeks. Between now and October 1, I invite you to keep a journal where you write about two subjects: 1. What is the main question that life asks you? 2. What is the main question that your life asks the world? CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): North Korea’s Capricorn leader Kim Jong-un has an amazing résumé, if you believe the official state media that boasts he learned to drive at age three, was an accomplished sailor at nine, and became a skilled musician, artist, and scientist. Is it possible you have unexpressed powers like these, Capricorn? If so, the coming weeks will be a favorable time to identify them and start tapping into their potential. It’s time to develop your dormant talents. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Aquarian author testified, “I think of beauty as an absolute necessity. I don’t think it’s a privilege or an indulgence. It’s almost like knowledge, which is to say, it’s what we were born for.” I urge you to adopt her perspective during the next four weeks, Aquarius. In my astrological opinion, a devoted quest for beauty will heal exactly what most needs to be healed in you. It will teach you everything you most need to know. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Poet and translator Anne Carson periodically joins with her husband Robert Currie to teach a workshop called “EgoCircus.” It’s an ironic title, because the subject they teach is the art of collaboration. To develop skills as a collaborator, of course, people must lay aside at least some of their egos’ needs and demands. In accordance with current astrological potentials, I encourage you to stage your own version of EgoCircus in the coming weeks. The time is ripe for you to hone your creative togetherness and synergistic intimacy. ARIES (March 21-April 19): “We need to become more unreasonable but in an intelligent way,” says Aries politician Jerry Brown. Yes! I agree! And that’s especially true for you right now, Aries. To Brown’s advice, I will add this message from Aries fashion designer Vivienne Westwood: “Intelligence is composed mostly of imagination, insight—things that have nothing to do with reason.” Here’s one further suggestion to help you take maximum advantage of cosmic rhythms, courtesy of Aries historian : “The supreme accomplishment is to blur the line between work and play.” TAURUS (April 20-May 20): “I have become whole and complete, like a thundering cloudburst in summer,” wrote Taurus poet . I love that metaphor for fullness: not an immaculate icon of shiny, sterile perfection, but rather a primal, vigorous force of nature in all of its rumbling glory. I hope you like this symbol as much as I do, and I hope you use it to fuel your creative spirit in the coming weeks. PS: Keep in mind that many indigenous people welcome rainstorms as a source of fertility and growth. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): “Pandiculation” is a word that refers to when you stretch and yawn at the same time. According to my understanding of the astrological omens, you will benefit from doing a lot of pandiculations in the coming days. I also recommend gazing lazily out the window and looking at the sky a lot. Keep your shoes off as much as possible, get a massage or three, and let yourself sleep more than you customarily do. Did you know that sighing deeply is good for your lungs’ health? Here’s your homework: Dream up all the things you can do to relax and renew yourself. It’s prime time to indulge in generous acts of self-healing. CANCER (June 21-July 22): The ancient Roman author Pliny’s ten-volume , written in the first century, was a monumental encyclopedia of the natural world, unprecedented in its own time and for centuries afterward. It offered compilations of facts about astronomy, geography, zoology, botany, mineralogy, and many other subjects. There was one big problem with it, however. It contained a great deal of erroneous information. For example, Pliny described in detail many non-existent animals, including dragons, flying horses, and giant serpents that swallowed bulls and snatched birds out of the sky. My reason for telling you this is to inspire you to be extra discerning in the coming weeks. Be especially skeptical of authorities, experts, and other know-it-alls who are very confident despite being inaccurate or erroneous. It’s time for you to increase your trust in your own authority. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): “There are those fortunate hours when the world consents to be made into a poem,” writes Leo poet . That’s great for a poet. But what about for everyone else? My variation on Doty’s comment is this: There are fortunate hours when the world consents to be made into a holy revelation or a lyrical breakthrough or a marvelous feeling that changes our lives forever.

"Renovating an old home will always produce surprises—but sometimes the discovery is a treasure that could fund the entire project. Three stonemasons working on a centuries-old estate purchased by a couple in 2012 in Plozevet, Brittany, found a hidden metal box embedded in a wall. They were shocked to find it stuffed with rare gold coins, minted during the reigns of French Kings Louis XIII and Louis XIV. 63-year-old François Mion, who owns the 13th century mansion with his wife, decided to turn the barn into a living space. When he got the call from his foreman, he “thought it was a joke.” Then, a few days later, above a beam, they discovered a bag containing another stash—which added to the grand total of 239 gold coins. The cache is being put up for auction on September 29, says , which estimates them to be worth well over a quarter million euros, or $300,000. : The couple submitted the trove to the Regional Preventive Archeology Service for authenticating and analyzing. They determined that the last known inhabitants of the mansion dates back to the mid-18th century, owned probably by wealthy land owners, possibly traders involved in the transport of Bordeaux wines to England. : French law states that the haul will be shared 50-50 between the owners of the property and those who discovered the coins—so the trio of stonemasons are likely lifting a glass to toast their luck. a French television report below…",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/3-stonemasons-find-stash-of-rare-gold-coins/
"When you look at yourself in the bathroom mirror, do you focus in on your favorite feature and give yourself a compliment? Do you think about how grateful you are to be alive, and fortunate to have a bathroom with hot and cold running water? Or do you focus on something you wish were different, and hear a critical inner voice? If you tend to find fault and criticize yourself, know that you have plenty of company among your fellow humans. In fact, our tendency to focus attention on negative issues instead of positive ones is a shared characteristic we carry from our earliest evolutionary survival needs. This ‘negativity bias,’ as science has labeled it, is our typical default orientation. Moving toward a more loving, appreciative, and grateful way of being—both towards ourselves and towards others—is something we are all capable of doing. But it does require awareness and repetition. If we are ready to be kind to ourselves and willing to send that negative voice away on permanent vacation, how do we begin to build our capacity for self-compassion? Kristin Neff, PhD, the world’s , identifies three elements of self-compassion that offer a roadmap to strengthening our self-compassion skills. Let’s investigate the three elements—mindfulness, self-kindness, and recognition of our common humanity—to create a self-compassion toolkit. Circle back to the first mention of the bathroom mirror chat with yourself. We asked you to notice whether your positive or negative voice was more dominant. Noticing, paying attention, and being aware of how you are already treating yourself is really the first step. Mindfulness, which simply means paying attention to what is happening in the present moment, allows us to be aware of what our inner dialogue is doing. It’s most helpful to approach this awareness gently, and without judgment. In other words, if you want to be gentler to yourself, you can’t get angry with yourself for being angry with yourself. Begin by simply naming what you are feeling and what your inner voice is saying to you. Use your actual name as you describe what you are doing, seeing, and feeling, “Laura is really upset with herself for looking so tired and for the bags under her eyes since she went to bed super late the last few nights.” Then, instead of judging and blaming yourself, be curious about what you did and the motivation. Recognize that our actions generally arise from a place of wanting to feel safe and wanting to do the right thing. Name that positive motive, “I am upset with myself and the way I look because I want to get all my assignments complete on time.” Remind yourself that you are doing the best you can with what you’ve got. And keep your attention on the positive aspects of the situation. : For many people, once they tune in carefully to that inner voice, it can be jolting to notice how we regularly speak to ourselves. Recognizing that you speak to yourself in ways that you would never speak to a friend is the next step to deepening your self-compassion by ramping up our self-kindness. One of the challenges of self-compassion is that compassion itself is a relational skill, i.e,. it’s easier to offer compassion to someone else. It’s hard to acknowledge our primary relationship with ourselves, and to view it through the lens of a loving relationship. Know that we all are worthy of love, we are all enough. With a little practice, showing loving kindness to yourself might first seem awkward, but will begin to come more easily. Soon the positive feeling you receives from self-kindness will provide its own sense of wellbeing and become self-reinforcing. : At The Center for Compassionate Leadership, one of our favorite practices to strengthen your self-kindness is called “Note to a Dear Friend.” It’s a straightforward way to turn the kindness that you can naturally offer others toward yourself. When you are facing a challenge or hardship, write a note to a friend as if they were facing the same problem. Write down what is in your heart that you think would help comfort your friend. Then, take the note and replace your friend’s name in the salutation with your own. The on the Center’s website. A very natural response to our own suffering is to screen it off from friends and family so that they don’t see our troubles. We might feel ashamed, embarrassed, or just not perfect enough. We want others to see our wonderful, happy life. It is very important to remember that no one is immune – we all meet suffering at some point, and some of us unfortunately suffer more than others, Everyone faces challenges and makes mistakes. Not one of us leads a picture perfect life! In this age of social media it is particularly difficult to grasp that we all have troubles. The social feeds of other people are the “highlight reels” of their lives, and our daily life is going to be very challenged to compare to that “highlight reel.” When we recognize that suffering is a common human trait, a couple of valuable things happen. First, our suffering gets a little bit less lonely. I can acknowledge I am not the only person suffering, and that takes a weight off my shoulders, knowing I am not alone. Second, it becomes a little easier to open up to others, and say, “I’m hurting or I need help.” We don’t have to pretend that everything is great when it isn’t. It’s OK to take off the masks and let people know exactly how we are. In fact, being honest about our feelings is the best way to develop more closeness and intimacy, because we all understand these difficult moments happen! : Self-compassion is a skill that gets better and better the more you practice it. Like any new habit development, repetition is key for the brain to establish new neural connections. Like muscles in your physical body, training is important to strengthen and sharpen your skills.It also gets easier. So start with small steps, and keep on moving forward. Be patient and celebrate every success, large or small. Every time you recognize how you treat yourself makes the next recognition smoother and easier. Each word of self-kindness you offer yourself reinforces how valuable it is to do. And every time you see your own suffering in the context of the suffering of the world builds deeper connections to others, which make healing and wellbeing easier. Taking up an intentional practice of self-compassion becomes a fulfilling, self-reinforcing path towards greater wholeness and happiness. : Just imagine looking at yourself in that mirror and feeling the warmth of love toward yourself as you do for a partner, child, best friend, or pet. Try on some self-compassion skills, and see yourself in a whole new light.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/self-compassion-researcher-suggests-4-steps-to-overcome-negativity-bias/

"Sound is what sets off the best memories—ahead of sight and even smell, according to a new poll. Birds singing and waves crashing on the shore were among the top sounds most likely to trigger people’s fond memories. A study of 2,000 adults, aged 50 and over, found four in 10 people experience sounds that prompt nostalgic thoughts a couple of times a week. For some, rain on the windows, sheep bleating, and a train going down the tracks are enough to make them smile. Other respondents said these sounds transport them to another place in another time, including trees blowing in the wind, a crackling fireplace, and church bells. Gordon Harrison, chief audiologist at , which commissioned the survey, said, “Sound impacts most aspects of our lives, so it is no surprise that certain sounds trigger happy youthful memories.” This is particularly true when it comes to sounds of the outdoors. These trigger memories of good times for 67 percent of adults. No wonder 78 percent of those polled said they tend to spend lots of time outside. And of the 94 percent who have access to their own outdoor space, they’ll spend an average of five hours in it every week – with 72 percent referring to it as their ‘happy place’. The kettle whistling, the radio playing, and cats purring also featured in the top 40 positively-triggering sounds, according to the over 50s. More than three quarters said that as they grow older, they treasure their happy memories more. : However, more than half of respondents admitted their hearing has deteriorated with age, yet only 26 percent have had it checked by an audiologist. A full 90% confessed they took their hearing for granted in their younger years, according to the survey, carried out through OnePoll.

"The folds and ripples at the front of a moth’s forewings are a sophisticated defense system against the echolocation of hunting bats in the darkness, a new study reveals. Moths have developed several forms of sonic decoys to throw hunting bats off their scent, but a thorough examination done at the University of Bristol has shown the decoys developed on the forewing tips have a unique success rate. Bats create ultrasonic clicks with their mouth that bounce off of objects in the dark and return to be picked up by their hyperdeveloped auditory organs, giving them a picture of the world around them. Luna moths have been known to develop long gown-like hindwings with screwed-up tips. It’s been shown that these hindwings are very strong reflectors of sound, such that it’s actually more likely a bat would end up attacking the decoy rather than the vulnerable body of the moth. Some large silkmoths though, like the Atlas moth or the ailanthus silkmoth have rippled and folded tips on their forewings, which have been revealed as the superior method of defense. “We noticed that on many of the larger silkmoths, the forewing tips are actually folded and rippled, in a way not to dissimilar to the hindwing decoys we looked at earlier,” , a bioacoustics researcher at School for Biological Sciences, Bristol U. He and his colleague Marc Holdereid bombarded the wings of an Atlas moth with different frequencies of ultrasonic sound from over 10,000 directions to test how well they might reflect the clicks from a hungry bat. The results, published in , were that forewing folds and ripples bounced off incoming sound, releasing it back into the environment in 180 degrees around the wing. This made them more reflective of sound, and therefore a better sonic defense, even than the hindwing decoys used by the Luna moths. The folds reflected the sound by sending it into a series of ninety-degree angles within the fold, which the ripples acted as hemispheric reflectors of sound like a bowl or an amphitheater. Another benefit of the decoys being in the forewings is that they are rigid in structure, and so any bat attacks would likely knock a moth off its flight path, rather than damage the wing. : Another fascinating detail of this fascinating evolutionary defense system is that it may have evolved independently more than four times across the entire genus, and 36 of the 72 species Neil and Holdereid examined had either folded or rippled forewings, yet never together with a wing decoy. Perhaps because two decoys, being present at each end of the moth, might clue the bat into the fact that something of interest might be in the middle. It’s a perfect example of nature’s ability to pair graceful form with life-saving function.

"The story of the Southwest suffering under the second-driest period in 1,200 years is being turned into another one, of cooperation and dedication to preserving as much water as possible. Lake Mead, the site of the Hoover Dam, and the chief water resource of a sprawling series of desert communities and metropolises, is falling. But revealed in its falling to the lowest levels ever recorded is not only the “bathtub ring” of calcium buildups seen here, but decades of cooperative drought contingency planning and water conservation infrastructure implemented not only through the seven states that rely on the Colorado River Basin and Lake Mead, but Mexico too. It was in 2007 that the seven states of California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming, as well as many tribes, and Mexico all agreed on a framework for use of the mighty Colorado River and Lake Mead, but in the face of the current 22-year drought, which led the federal government last Monday to declare the first ever shortage of water from Lake Mead, something more had to be done. After years of tough negotiations, each state agreed to share the burden of future potential water shortages, pursuant to the 2019 Drought Contingency Plan. As Lake Mead is expected to drop below a depth of 1,075 feet next year, the first round of water cuts will come into effect in the states of Nevada and Arizona, and for Mexico. At 1,045 feet, it would be California’s turn to take a cut. “We haven’t had litigation. If you look at any other river basin, they have litigation going like crazy,” Patricia Aaron, spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, told the Christian Science Monitor. “Everybody is in this together. It gives me a lot of hope and a lot of confidence. There are a lot of dedicated, smart people working on this problem.” Mexico for their part led the way in a bilateral contingency plan in 2017. Under current agreements Mexico of the total volume of the Colorado River ever year. “We knew it was the correct thing to do,” also heard from Roberto Salmon, former- Mexican commissioner of the International Boundary and Water Commission. “We are all trying to save the [Colorado River] basin. The livelihood of millions of people depends on it, including Mexico.” Several states have already invested millions into ensuring that when a water shortage in the Colorado or Lake Mead did arrive, they wouldn’t be caught out. In Nevada for example, Las Vegas a seven-billion gallon reduction in water use from Lake Mead as having “little impact.” This is a result of sophisticated water recycling that sends spent water back to Lake Mead, as well as the use of ornamental desert foliage for public parks and real estate. In California, which draws about three times as much water as Mexico, water authorities built up reserves during the wet years of 2017 and 2019, while implementing additional storm drain and wastewater recovery methods to boost supply. The 19 million people living in Southern California now use 40% less water than they did in 1990, CSM reports. Arizona has also “banked” water in Lake Mead, pre-delivering a 50% store of its yearly share through savings accumulated over a decade of diversifying its supply, for example by drawing on the Salt and Verde Rivers. Phoenix, which has exploded in size over the past two decades, has also reduced its water consumption by 30%. South of the border, Mexico’s agreement to be first on the chopping block for cuts from Lake Mead was penned alongside promises from California, Nevada, and Arizona to invest $31.5 million in conservation and infrastructure projects in the Mexicali Valley which will save 200,000 acre feet of water per year. This U.S. citizen is accustomed to feeling there was no plan in the aftermath of natural disasters or dangerous natural phenomena, but in the deserts of the Southwest that is certainly not the case, and the inter-cooperation between state, tribe, city, and nation is something to behold.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/lake-mead-water-shortages-declared-but-the-states-are-prepared/
"The superconducting magnets which could be a key to powering an efficient nuclear fusion reactor were just turned on in the labs of an American firm. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS_ generated an electrical field of 20 tesla—the most powerful ever created on Earth; 50,000 times-stronger than the magnetosphere—for five hours. This gave scientists at CFS the confidence to say that a working prototype of their fusion reactor could be ready by 2025; a huge leap forward from a that reckoned on a 2040 arrival time. Nuclear fusion is perhaps the world’s most dynamic engineering challenge, and the magnets are one method by which humans may be able to make it work. With them, CFS believe the reactors of the future could be small, and dramatically cheaper than the billions Western governments are on fusion projects. The goal of any reactor is to create a plasma—the forth state of matter, which is essentially a superheated gas. The heavy isotopes inside a hydrogen atom, deuterium and tritium, are heated inside the reactor to hundreds of millions of degrees until they convert to helium. The energy they give off is converted to electricity. If such a powerful machine can produce more electricity than it uses, unlimited clean energy can be achieved, which means it doesn’t matter if the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, it means coal, oil, and gas can all remain in the ground, that never again would a war be fought over oil resources, and that global climate change could be rapidly scaled back. In fact, the CFS research and development team that their reactor will be able to turn a glass of water into the electricity usage of one human for their entire lifetime. Superconducting magnets make achieving those extreme temperatures much easier. 18 of CFS’ magnets will be arranged like a big metal donut to create pressures in the fusion chamber, known as a tokamak, of up to two-times as much as at the deepest point in the ocean. This immense squeezing causes the immense heat needed for fusion to occur. “Three years ago we announced a plan to build a 20-tesla magnet, which is what we will need for future fusion machines,” says Bob Mumgaard, CFO of CFS, in a story to the . “We now have a platform that is both scientifically very well-advanced, because of the decades of research on these machines, and also commercially very interesting. What it does is allow us to build devices faster, smaller, and at less cost.” The magnets are wrapped with 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of superconducting tape made from a barium copper oxide. This tape has taken decades to develop, and when cooled to -253 °C, which used to take a refrigerator the size of a house, it removes all the natural barriers to superconductivity, and can easily handle nearly all of the 40,000 amps passing through the tokamak at any one time, and very efficiently. All of this work, and the successful test, means that CFS can begin work on their SPARC, a sort of miniature version of a full-scale nuclear fusion plant. The facility to house the SPARC is already under construction.

"These stunning drone pictures show a huge field filled with more than 100,000 sunflowers—planted to read the word ‘hope’. The breathtaking field at Ardross Farm in Scotland spans 1.5 hectares—the size of four football pitches—and recently came into bloom five months after it was planted. Reverend Douglas Creighton from East Neuk Trinity Church came up with the idea for a sunflower field in a bid to bring people joy during the pandemic. He asked farmer Claire Pollock to help get it off the ground, and she agreed to planting more than 100,000 sunflowers at the start of May. The pair hope the maze will bring joy to the local community, with 500 people walking through it when it opened last weekend. It takes 20 minutes to complete the huge maze, and £2,000 ($2,766) has already been raised for local charities. Reverend Creighton said of the project,  “It’s something bright and cheerful for everyone in the community—we sowed a bit of hope and optimism to show it’s not all doom and gloom. “I even hosted a live planting during lockdown where people joined in on Zoom to watch. Farmer Claire said, “We have always grown wildflowers to help the birds and spread a bit of cheer,” saying it’s been great to do something that would make people smile and get local people involved. “It’s a maze of hope in a field of hope and we want it to be something fun and different.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/drone-pictures-field-filled-with-more-than-100000-sunflowers/

"The seat of power for one of the most influential women in Medieval English history, Queen Cynethryth, has been discovered in a small Berkshire village. A lost monastery in Cookham where Cynethryth ruled as abbess was located by a team from the University of Reading and local volunteers, and consists of the timber remains of buildings where the monks and nuns lived, as well as artifacts such as jewelry, crockery, and personal items. Cynethryth was the wife of King Offa. The two ruled the old kingdom of Mercia in the four decades before the arrival of the Vikings in 793CE, and were determined to bring Christian values and better court decorum to their land. “Cynethryth is a fascinating figure, a female leader who clearly had genuine status and influence in her lifetime,” Dr. Gabor Thomas, the University of Reading archaeologist leading the excavation. “The items that have been uncovered will allow us to piece together a detailed impression of how the monks and nuns who lived here ate, worked and dressed. This will shed new light on how Anglo-Saxon monasteries were organized and what life was like in them,” he said. While the details of almost anyone living in Britain during this period—even a king or queen, are scant, two discoveries bear testimony to the power wielded by Cynethryth during her life. Coins minted during the reign of Offa and Cynethryth featured her visage, one of very few examples in all of Western Europe, much less England, and when King Offa exchanged letters with his opposite number in France (Charlemagne), to whom he considered himself equal, Charlemagne would address the letters to both Offa and Cynethryth by name. Writing by Susan Abernethy at The Medievalists tells us that people in the know—in this case a poet/teacher/English scholar/ecclesiastical figure named Alcuin who was a contemporary of Offa and Cynethryth—considered her very important indeed. “In a letter Alcuin wrote during Offa’s reign, he hints that Cynethryth was too busy with the king’s business to read correspondence,” . In another letter he designates her as ‘mistress of the royal household’ and calls her pious. Alcuin emphasizes the legitimacy of her marriage with Offa and the legitimacy of her children and their suitability to inherit the throne of Mercia.” The discovery of her monastery was made along the River Thames on the grounds of the modern Holy Trinity Church, a rumored location of the monastery where, following the passing of her husband, she ruled as “royal abbess” from the year 796 until her death. The monastery’s position along the Thames is not only the modern border of Berkshire, but during the 790s was also the disputed border between Mercia and another Medieval kingdom called Wessex, highlighting the political and strategic importance of the site. Livia Gershon, writing for “excavations showed that the building was constructed on a gravel island that raised it above areas that faced frequent flooding. The site was divided into zones, including a housing area and another with a cluster of hearths that were probably used for metalworking.” As a religious and royal figure, the team from Reading expect that her remains are to be found at the site, an incredibly exciting potential discovery, as the physical remains of a person can be used to create 3D imaging of what the powerful queen might have looked like.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cynethyrth-medieval-queens-lost-monastery-found-by-the-thames-river/
"A quartet of manufacturing firms has managed to create the world’s first fossil fuel-free steel in Sweden, much of which will go straight into the foundries of Volvo to create the first cars ever made with “green steel.” It’s a massive first step to decarbonizing a carbon-heavy industry, as steel-making worldwide accounts for 8% of all CO2 emissions resulting from the need for coal in the manufacturing process, and the firms involved in the discovery represent 10% of Sweden’s emissions, and 7% of Finland’s. Since the Warring States period in Ancient China, and , metalworkers have understood that to take a useful metal, iron, and turn it into a superior alloy, steel, they needed very high heat and a bit of coal. Today, that coal is being replaced with hydrogen by Swedish venture firm HYBRIT, owned by Swedish steelmaker SSAB, the state-owned utility Vattenfall, and the mining firm LKAB. HYBRIT’s method to create the high temperatures and carbon necessary to replace coal in their steel. Their hope is to get green steel into the bodies of Volvo cars as soon as possible, and into the global circulating market “The first fossil-free steel in the world is not only a breakthrough for SSAB, it represents proof that it’s possible to make the transition and significantly reduce the global carbon footprint of the steel industry. We hope that this will inspire others to also want to speed up the green transition,” says Martin Lindqvist, President and CEO of SSAB. Hardly resting on this remarkable achievement, HYBRIT and its backers are looking to ensure the steel plant and the boilers needed to heat the hydrogen to 1,000°C (1,832°F) for their manufacturing process is run by fossil fuel-free power sources. They are focused on electric gas heating, and their plant in Luleå, Sweden will trial a 250 kilowatt boiler. If it goes well, a megawatt version will be developed. “This is one of many exciting steps among all the development taking place within the fossil-free value chain,” Eva Vitell, GM of Hybrit Development AB.

"Supportive social interactions in adulthood are important for your ability to stave off cognitive decline, a new study finds. Researchers observed that simply having someone available most or all of the time whom you can count on to listen to you when you need to talk is associated with greater cognitive resilience—a measure of your brain’s ability to function better than would be expected for the amount of physical aging—or disease-related changes in the brain, which many neurologists believe can be boosted by engaging in mentally stimulating activities, physical exercise, and positive social interactions. “We think of cognitive resilience as a buffer to the effects of brain aging and disease,” says lead researcher Joel Salinas, MD, the Lulu P. and David J. Levidow Assistant Professor of Neurology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and member of the Department of Neurology’s Center for Cognitive Neurology. “This study adds to growing evidence that people can take steps, either for themselves or the people they care about most, to increase the odds they’ll slow down cognitive aging or prevent the development of symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease—something that is all the more important given that we still don’t have a cure for the disease.” An estimated 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease, a progressive condition that affects mostly those over 65 and interferes with memory, language, decision-making, and the ability to live independently. Salinas says that while the disease usually affects an older population, the results of this study indicate that people younger than 65 would benefit from taking stock of their social support. For every unit of decline in brain volume, individuals in their 40s and 50s with low listener availability had a cognitive age that was four years older than those with high listener availability. “These four years can be incredibly precious. Too often we think about how to protect our brain health when we’re much older, after we’ve already lost a lot of time decades before to build and sustain brain-healthy habits,” says Salinas. “But today, right now, you can ask yourself if you truly have someone available to listen to you in a supportive way, and ask your loved ones the same. Taking that simple action sets the process in motion for you to ultimately have better odds of long-term brain health and the best quality of life you can have.” Salinas also recommends that physicians consider adding this question to the standard social history portion of a patient interview: asking patients whether they have access to someone they can count on to listen to them when they need to talk. “Loneliness is one of the many symptoms of depression, and has other health implications for patients,” says Salinas. “These kinds of questions about a person’s social relationships and feelings of loneliness can tell you a lot about a patient’s broader social circumstances, their future health, and how they’re really doing outside of the clinic.” Researchers used one of the longest running and most closely monitored community-based cohorts in the U.S., the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), as the source of their study’s 2,171 participants, with an average age of 63. FHS participants self-reported information on the availability of supportive social interactions including listening, good advice, love and affection, sufficient contact with people they’re close with, and emotional support. Study participants’ cognitive resilience was measured as the relative effect of total cerebral brain volume on global cognition, using MRI scans and neuropsychological assessments taken as part of the FHS. Lower brain volumes tend to associate with lower cognitive function, and in this study, researchers examined the modifying effect of individual forms of social support on the relationship between cerebral volume and cognitive performance. The cognitive function of individuals with greater availability of one specific form of social support was higher relative to their total cerebral volume. This key form of social support was listener availability and it was highly associated with greater cognitive resilience. Researchers note that further study of individual social interactions may improve understanding of the biological mechanisms that link psychosocial factors to brain health. “While there is still a lot that we don’t understand about the specific biological pathways between psychosocial factors like listener availability and brain health, this study gives clues about concrete, biological reasons why we should all seek good listeners and become better listeners ourselves,” says Salinas of the study, which was published on August 16 in",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nyu-study-cognitive-relience-alzheimers-connection-listening/
"Indiana could be the first state in the Union to have a wireless charging road that tops up your electric vehicle as you drive along it. As the 21st century rolls on, we’ve all had those one or two moments where we see some new technology and the pace of innovation really comes home to roost in our heads, normally with some recollection of or . Maybe for some it would have been the self-driving feature of the Tesla, or smart home systems, but for motorists in Indiana, that moment may come by way of a shiny new wireless road. While range and battery charging times , it’s still the most limiting factor when it comes to the purchase of an EV. The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) has decided to tackle that by burying electrified wire coils that create a magnetic field along the road surface, mimicking the way wireless charging stations for tablets and phones are designed. In order to use the roads, cars would be fitted with a receiver coil to pick up the charge as they go along, and becoming magnetized, draw electricity from the coils themselves. Expected to take three phases, the work will begin in late summer, according to a statement from the contracted German firm in charge of designing and installing the technology, Magment. “This project is a real step forward towards the future of dynamic wireless charging,” Mauricio Esguerra, CEO of Magment, “that will undoubtedly set the standard for affordable, sustainable, and efficient transportation electrification.” Copper prices are pretty high these days; early in spring they were at an all-time record, so Magment are ditching copper wire coils for recycled ferrite, will allow them to “achieve transmission efficiency of up to 95% and be built at standard road-building installation costs,” according to Singularity Hub. If the cost savings are real, then it could start production quite soon following two planned lab tests. It’s the first such electrified charging road in the U.S., and is a projection by researchers working on charging roads at the University of Cornell that it would be 5-10 years before such technology would be available. The Indiana model would represent, if successful, the best in a field that is no means monopolized. Sweden that allow the largest vehicles on the highway to charge by way of an electric arm on their undercarriage that draws power from the rail.

"After over a year of empty classrooms, dusty bookshelves, and quiet playgrounds, many students across the U.S. are finally returning to school. For teachers, that means working to gather vital school supplies to cover classroom work and fun. Unfortunately, teachers are often forced to juggle tight budgets to cover all the essentials. Thankfully, has become a fantastic platform for filling any gaps—and T-Mobile is stepping in to help with a $1,000,000 donation. DonorsChoose lets educators ask the public for the classroom materials they need to ensure students’ success. For example, in Minnesota, Mrs. Wamsley is asking for an SD card and camera bag for her yearbook class. In New Jersey, Mrs. Trasferini is wishing for a Book Nook for her second-grade class. And Mrs. Robertson would like support in buying an easel pad and headphones for her first graders. With T-Mobile’s $1 million donation, DonorsChoose will be able to fulfill these and other requests and help jumpstart the transition back to an in-person learning environment. DonorsChoose makes the process easy, purchasing and shipping items directly to the school and sending a thank you note to the donor. “This coming school year might be the most important of our generation, and teachers will need all the encouragement we can give them as so many return to classrooms,” says DonorsChoose Founder and CEO, Charles Best. “T-Mobile’s gift to teachers will help students start the year strong and support them during a time of readjustment.” But getting essential school supplies is just half the battle. The stay-at-home orders implemented in many states forced families to work and learn from home for months, relying on high-speed internet and wireless connectivity. Over the last year, lack of home internet has substantially widened the digital divide for many students. T-Mobile has been stepping up to help mitigate this technological burden. This year, T-Mobile is continuing their work with —their $10.7 billion initiative to provide 10 million underserved households with free internet and mobile hotspots over the next 10 years. “Back-to-school is special this year,” acknowledges Jon Freier, EVP of T-Mobile’s Consumer Group. “It represents getting back to so much more that we’ve missed, after a really trying year for families, teachers, and students. That’s why T-Mobile is going big here to help everyone stay connected with America’s largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network.” For families, teachers, and students gearing up for a new school year and looking for a new phone, T- Mobile is now when you switch and activate on the Magenta MAX rate plan—no trade required. But if you want to trade in your old device, you can score an iPhone 12 Pro on Us when you switch, trade in a device, and activate on Magenta MAX.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/t-mobile-1mil-donors-choose-donation/
"As the world’s premier home furnishings retailer, IKEA has for decades been forgetting to offer consumers the most important home furnishing of them all: electricity. Being that the largest furniture retailer on Earth has a new pledge to cut emissions by 50% by 2030 and get to carbon neutrality by 2050, IKEA has decided to fill in that gap with clean energy, allowing customers to buy wind and solar electricity and infrastructure from IKEA. Part of these emissions calculations represent a remarkable display of responsibility, as the group looks at sales of electrical appliances, and factor in the electricity used to power them before adding that figure to their climate targets. “At IKEA, we want to become fully circular and climate positive by 2030, built on renewable energy and resources. We believe the future of energy is renewable and we want to make electricity from sustainable sources more accessible and affordable for all,” stated Jan Gardberg, New Retail Business Manager, Ingka Group. Since 2016 the Ingka Group, which manages 367 of the 423 worldwide stores, ($2.76 billion) in renewable energy, including two solar parks in the U.S., a wind farm in Romania, and 534 wind turbines in 14 countries. They’ve also installed nearly a million solar panels on their stores, and market IKEA-brand solar panels to 11 world markets. As well as powering their furniture fueled empire, this renewable energy can now be bought by customers. Through the STRÖMMA offer, customers who live in Sweden from solar and wind, and use an app to track their own electricity usage. Customers who have already bought solar panels from IKEA can also track their own production in the app and sell back the electricity they don’t use themselves. So far their home country is the only one in which IKEA customers can buy electricity, but considering the brand now owns 100 more wind turbines than stores, it won’t be long before they enter the utilities markets elsewhere. IKEA have just joined up with H&M, Walmart, and Kingfisher Group to start the , aimed at taking the lead in the retail industry towards reducing global warming to below levels outlined by the IPCC. Like IKEA’s personal targets, the Race to Zero pledge involves halving emissions by 2030 and becoming neutral by 2050, a massive challenge for any company in retail where the industry thrives off of large-scale, cheap production and sales. “At IKEA, we have committed to becoming climate positive by 2030 and as part of that, we are also committed to the 1.5°C goal in the Paris Agreement. This movement seeks to engage the retail sector and by working together and acting with speed, focusing on what makes real impact, we can truly make a difference. For people and the planet,” stated Jesper Brodin, CEO, Ingka Group I IKEA. “Engagement in the Race to Zero Breakthroughs: Retail Campaign is an opportunity for retailers to help the retail sector accelerate a whole-economy transition for a healthy, resilient, zero-carbon future,” explains their website. “Retailers will receive sector-specific guidance, access to networks and a ready-made strategic template to achieve net-zero emissions.” IKEA has been pushing back against emissions wherever they can be found, including through the , and the to prevent it from ending up in landfills.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/ikea-now-sells-renewable-energy-along-with-its-furniture/
"Smart algorithms are used to make calculations for data-driven science in a dizzying number of ways, but one man has used them to build a once-in-a-lifetime American experience. Dr. Randy Olson has created an algorithm that planned the optimal and ultimate U.S. National Parks road trip, featuring the most expedient route to visit the original 47 National Parks in the continental United States. The modern National Parks System was inspired in part by the increasing popularity of the automobile, and the U.S. interstate highway system was built to run through as many of the U.S. Parks as possible. As one can see in the Ken Burns documentary by the 1960s, taking your Ford or Chevy on a trip across the West was the quintessential American vacation, and the crown jewel of the tourism industry. The trip in total comes out to 14,498 miles (23,333 km), not counting rest stops, and will take about two months driving at what as a “breakneck pace,” though anyone looking for an enjoyable road trip will want to take in the scenery at each park, and realistically need more like 3-4 months to do such an adventure justice. Olson, who is the Chief Data Scientist at FOXO Bioscience, described the trip as a “circle,” by which he meant you could jump on the route at any point and go either way to visit the next 46 Parks. It is not by any means a circle around the perimeter of the US. For instance, when starting your travels by going westward from Minnesota’s northern lakes, the route plunges southward from North Dakota all the way down to the border between New Mexico and Colorado. It snakes westward into the Great Basin in Nevada, and climbs right back up again to Glacier NP on the border with Canada. This massive detour is on account of one of the five or six mega states in the National Park System, Utah, and its central location. But beyond that the trip is well planned as one can start at any point and face the same amount of driving as if they’d started anywhere else. Olson’s blog post about his route was a popular topic with his readers, and they enthusiastically flooded the comment section with suggestions, calculations on gasoline costs, advantages of RVs vs traditional sedans for better gas mileage, and other details. One commenter mentioned that cutting out the Florida parks, and Acadia National Park in Maine, would save a ton of time. Another popular discussion was regarding other types of land units managed by the National Parks Service—such as National Scenic Riverways, National Monuments, National Lakeshores. These define the spirit of the NPS, which is not only to protect those lands that the nation values most, but those that individual communities value too. Other suggestions for optimizing your trip include through New York to Maine, which would run through the mountains instead of the interstate, or managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management—which can save travelers many dollars in accommodations. Olson points out that you would need to have a flying car or airplane to efficiently visit the 12 parks located in America’s island territories, or in Alaska where there are eight parks, but his road trip does include the Channel Islands and Dry Tortugas, which require the use of boats for car and personal transport.

"There may be no force more powerful than maternal instinct. An Oklahoma mom, who’s come to think of some gifted Afghan girls as adopted daughters, has moved heaven and earth to help get the teens to safety since Taliban extremists retook Afghanistan. Harvard graduate Allyson Reneau has 11 kids of her own, but there was still plenty of room in her heart for the , a.k.a. “the Afghan Dreamers.” Reneau and the tight-knit group bonded back in 2019 when they met at a Washington D.C.-based Humans to Mars summit. (Having nine biological daughters probably helped.) In the weeks building up to the recent Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, Reneau became increasingly concerned for the girls’ welfare. Unable to shake the fear the Dreamers were in imminent danger, Reneau became frustrated by the lack of cooperation at home in the U.S. to secure their safety. Rather than wait, she decided to head to the sanctuary country of Qatar, hoping to use the connections she had there to help expedite a rescue. In conjunction with the Dreamers’ parent organization , and the Qatar Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Reneau was able to pull some strings and get the exit process rolling. Soon enough, 10 robotics team members between the ages of 16 and 18 were boarded on a commercial flight. (Some members of the team and the girls’ families have yet to leave Kabul. Efforts to secure their relocation are ongoing.) After receiving word from the girls to say they’d made it out of Kabul, Reneau was overcome with emotion. “I got a text from one of the girls that just said: ‘We did it.’ All the emotion from two weeks of work and running into a wall constantly, and burying your feelings, and bearing your feelings for the girls, it just hit me all at once,” Reneau told . DCF board member Elizabeth Schaeffer Brown says that while it took the combined efforts of several entities to ensure the girls’ release, she credits their own grit and self-determination as a key factor in the successful outcome. “Ultimately the girls ‘rescued’ themselves,” Brown told . “If it were not for their hard work and courage to pursue an education, which brought them in contact with the world, they would still be trapped. We need to continue to support them and others like them.” Since arriving in Qatar, the girls have been inundated with numerous scholarships from several prestigious U.S. universities, and Reneau is confident they will make the most of those opportunities. “For the first time in their life, I really believe they have the freedom to choose and to be the architects of their own destiny and their own future,” Reneau told Insider. “It’s the freeing feeling to me to know that they will be able to go somewhere and get educated wherever they want.” And isn’t that what every loving mom wants for her kids?",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/afghan-all-girls-robotics-team-get-us-scholarships/
"These amazing pictures showing the movement of a diving kingfisher are the result of a photographer’s two-year wait for the perfect photo. 47-year-old Vince Burton used a slow shutter speed to capture the trail of the bird as it plunged into a pond at up to 25mph (40kmh). The torpedo-like blue kingfisher can be seen hurtling beak-first towards the water as it hunts for fish to feed its young chicks near Norwich in Norfolk. Accountant Vince used the latest photographic techniques to reduce his shutter speed and darken the background, capturing a striking image of the kingfisher’s dive without using photoshop. He said: “I was working with this farmland site for four years. It’s taken me the best part of two years to get this shot.” “Normally one kingfisher holds the territory for a year and then welcomes a partner in from a neighboring territory. “These images were taken while the kingfishers were raising their brood, which fledged a month later.” Here at GNN, we’re so glad Vince got his perfect shots.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/vince-norfolk-diving-kingfisher-photos/
"A pesticide that appears to damage the health of children and farm workers has been banned from future use in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after facing a slew of lawsuits. Sprayed on apples, strawberries, citrus fruit, corn, alfalfa, grapes, cotton, almonds, walnuts, and broccoli since 1965, the organophosphate pesticide called chlorpyrifos to intellectual impairment, loss of working memory, and reduced IQ in children, as well as damage to of infants’ brains. It also impacts the health . In a major agriculture state, banned chlorpyrifos, but the EPA ruled that there was not enough evidence to do the same federally—until legal challenges resulted in a court judge ruling the onus was on the EPA to present indisputable proof that the pesticide did not cause harm in children. As it could not do so, as of August 20th the agency banned producers from using chlorpyrifos. The environmental-focused organization Earthjustice says it will continue its quest to ban all organophosphate pesticides from farms, even if they are used in non-food applications. One reason is because the spraying of the toxin is airborne and can drift to non-intended targets. For now, “Chlorpyrifos will finally be out of our fruits and vegetables,” Patti Goldman, an attorney for Earthjustice. “Children will no longer be eating food tainted with a pesticide that causes intellectual learning disabilities,” In 2017, more than half of the 10.4 million pounds of organophosphate pesticides sprayed on American soils were chlorpyrifos, meaning the ban will lead to the eventually decontamination of half of the total chemical burden—a huge victory for millions.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/epa-bans-toxic-pesticide-chlorpyrifos/

"A self-proclaimed hermit who became unintentionally famous after losing his home to a fire is about to get new digs thanks to generous donations to a GoFundMe campaign—and one whopping big check from a philanthropist. 81-year-old ‘River Dave’, whose real name is David Lidstone, had been living off-the-grid in the same secluded New Hampshire location for almost three decades. He didn’t own the property where he’d built his modest A-frame cabin on the banks of the Merrimack River, but says he had permission from the site’s previous owner to stay there. Citing environmental and zoning violations, the current owner, however, took steps to have him removed. On the same day that Lidstone appeared in court charged with civil contempt for refusing to vacate, his cabin burnt to the ground. While the cause was most likely accidental rather than arson, the result remained the same. River Dave—along with his cats and his chickens—was out of a home. Estranged from his wife and family, for most of his 27-year tenure on the 73-acre plot of timberland, Lidstone kept to himself. He did, however, occasionally befriend a passing kayaker or boater, and those ties proved strong enough to form an unexpected lifeline. Prior to the legal contretemps, longtime friend Jodie Gedeon hoped the situation between the landowner and Lidstone would come to a peaceful resolution. The owner’s lawyers thought otherwise, but after the fire, the point became moot. With Lidstone now homeless, Gedeon and friend Sharon Copello quickly organized a to help River Dave get back on his feet. As word of his plight spread, donations and offers of places to stay began to roll in. While the response was staggering and the initial $15,000 funding goal was quickly met, no one could have predicted what came next. On August 11, New Hampshire resident and billionaire CEO of Palantir Technologies Alexander Karp reached out to Lidstone and wrote him a personal check to the tune of $180,000 for living and future expenses. “I hope each of you are sitting down and have a tissue or two next to you as what I am going to share is part of the happy ending to come and I can’t imagine a dry eye anywhere after you read this,” Gedeon posted to her Facebook page of the generous donation. Lidstone needed a few hankies himself. “How can I express myself and my gratitude towards something like that? I start to tear up whenever I think about it,” Lidstone told the . “For an old logger who always had to work, for anyone to give you that type of money, it’s incredibly difficult for me to get my head around.” The monies raised for River Dave are being put into a trust for him. For reasons of privacy, he’ll be staying at an undisclosed location over the winter, and sometime next year, at a building site as yet to be named, construction for his new home will begin. “I feel about as good as I ever have in my life,” a grateful Lidstone told AP, although admitted the recent outpouring of kindness and support has been something of a revelation to him. “Maybe the things I’ve been trying to avoid are the things that I really need in life… I grew up never being hugged or kissed, or [having] any close contact… “I had somebody ask me once, about my wife: ‘Did you really love her?’ And the question kind of shocked me for a second. [I’d] never loved anybody in my life. And I shocked myself because I hadn’t realized that. And that’s why I was a hermit. Now I can see love being expressed that I never had before.” Meanwhile, as the GoFundMe campaign winds down at the end of August, Gedeon hopes to keep paying the love forward. “We feel we can help Dave build a good life now and will forever be thankful,” she posted. “We also know how many other charities and people are in need of help. At the end of the month, we’re asking that the spotlight be passed on to others to bring awareness and opportunities to spread the love and continue to be the change! “The world is a better place with each of you in it and we simply can’t thank you enough.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/hermit-gets-180k-for-cabin-river-dave/
"A diffuser which “smells like fear” could help keep pests off garden plants, according to a new study. The special odor is made up of compounds produced by ladybugs, a natural predator of plant-eating insects which ravage gardens and crops. Pests which catch a whiff of the stuff will change their behavior, thinking predators are nearby. Plant-eating insects represent a major threat for gardeners and farmers’ crops around the world, especially as they can carry diseases and are becoming increasingly resistant to traditional pesticides. Now, researchers at Pennsylvania State University have come up with a sweet-smelling solution. Study author Dr Sara Hermann said, “It is not uncommon to use our senses to avoid risky situations. If a building was on fire, we as humans could use our senses of sight or smell to detect the threat. “There is evidence for such behavioral responses to risk across taxa that suggest prey organisms can detect predation threats, but the mechanisms for detection aren’t very well understood, especially with insects.” Aphids are highly destructive, and their ability to transmit plant diseases make them a persistent problem for growers. They also happen to be a favorite food of ladybugs, which gardeners and farmers welcome as a kind of natural pest-control. That is because aphids and other plant-eating insects will steer clear of fields if they can smell predators nearby, the researchers found. Smells given off by ladybugs signal aphids to stop reproducing as much and grow larger wings, both behaviors seen to avoid threats. The research team identified and extracted the ladybugs’ “volatile odour” using gas chromatography, a technique which separates the different components of a smell. Aphids were then exposed to each component individually to see which one got the biggest reaction. The strength of their response was based on the signal picked up by an electroantennogram machine, which is specifically designed to test insects’ reactions to odors. Of the many compounds emitted by ladybugs, the strongest response was to a class of chemical compounds known as methoxypyrazines. Specifically these included isopropyl methoxypyrazine, isobutyl methoxypyrazine, and sec-butyl methoxypyrazine. A special odor blend, which can be placed in an essential oil diffuser to spread the scent over time across a garden or field, was then created. are now hoping to test their diffusers outdoors to see whether they produce the same results. They are also looking to measure the diffusers’ dispersal area and see whether they could be applied to other pests, predators, and crops. Study co-author Dr Jessica Kansman added: “Insects rely on olfactory cues to find food, mates, and places to live, so this is a great opportunity to investigate how to use these smells to manipulate their behaviour.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/diffuser-that-smells-like-fear-and-could-keep-pests-off-garden-plants/
"This year’s American James Dyson Award winner, Gabe Tavas, takes on deforestation with his invention, Pyrus. His mission is simple: Make wood without cutting down trees. By embracing a balance between nature and design, Gabe found a way to use bacterial cellulose—the main component of wood—to form an alternative material which imitates exotic woods found in the Amazon Rainforest. Gabe claims his ambition for creating global change came from what he calls the “immigrant influence.” His mother, now an immigration attorney, moved to the United States from Cuba as a small child and his father from the Philippines at age 17. “I began considering entrepreneurship as a teenager and felt an urgency around solving global issues in sustainability,” Gabe says. Born and raised in Chicago, Gabe yearned for more time spent in nature and found his escape at the Saint Paul Woods in Morton Grove, IL. “Growing up in the city, you don’t have many expressions of nature which can be stressful. Forests provide an escape. It’s my favorite place to meditate, and the thought of losing that because we were too short-sided pains me from a visceral level.” Every piece of wood has two essential ingredients: Cellulose, which provides its basic shape and framework, and Lignin, which acts as a glue for all the other components. Some kombucha companies use microorganisms that produce coherent sheets of cellulose on top of the liquid. To make Pyrus, these sheets of cellulose are blended to an even consistency and then embedded into a gel. As the gel dries, it hardens and is placed under a mechanical press to form a flat sheet of wood-like material. This material can then be sanded, cut, and coated with resins just like its tree-based counterparts. While there are several companies creating wood alternative materials, many are using sawdust. Utilizing sawdust still involves the cutting down of trees and damaging the natural ecosystem, but it also poses serious health risks to those overexposed to it. Sawdust is an irritant that can affect your eyes, nose, and throat, and in long-term exposures can even . With Pyrus, not a single tree is cut down and no dangerous oils are being used. Pyrus uses kombucha waste, which is both environmentally friendly and sustainably created, to create a cellulose making wood in a sustainable fashion. The end goal of Pyrus is to replace expensive and fancy wood products which are currently huge drivers of deforestation. Over the past year, Gabe has produced 74 Pyrus wood samples in a variety of colors and textures. Pyrus has been tested on several pieces of equipment commonly found in woodworking shops and makerspaces, all with the guidance and consistently positive feedback of professional woodworkers. Maintaining the versatility of wood, Pyrus can be made into jewelery, guitar picks, and coasters. Winning the national leg of the James Dyson Award will inject $2,600 into Gabe’s project. He plans to use the prize money to expand his production facilities and develop 3D printing processes. Ultimately, Gabe wants Pyrus to be made into various environmentally friendly products that meet consumer needs and are commercially viable. Three-time James Dyson Award judge and Technology Influencer Sam Sheffer had this to say about the award and this year’s winner: “I’ve judged the JDA for several years and am always captivated by the inventions these young engineers put forward. The 2021 entries were some of the most competitive I’ve seen. Pyrus stood out because it’s solving a problem we can all relate to with waste from a product that the majority of us consume every day. I’m excited to see all the innovative ways Pyrus will evolve under Gabe’s imaginative and talented leadership.” Pyrus will progress to the international stage of the James Dyson Award. The International shortlist will be announced on October 13 and the International winners on November 17.

"Manchester City are the reigning champions of the English Premier League, and now they’re championing the cause of landfill waste by offering edible coffee and tea cups at their 55,000 seater Etihad Stadium. After suffering a reversal at the hands of London’s Tottenham Hotspur F.C. on the opening weekend, seven days later they played their first home match of the season, drumming Norwich City 5-0 while producing 0 pounds of disposable hot drinks cups—a plague in a tea/coffee loving country where a staggering 2.5 billion disposable cups are used every year. “For the first time on Campus, an ‘edible coffee cup’ will also be introduced. This fantastic and innovative solution provides an amazing solution to waste, just eat your cup,” reads a from the Etihad Stadium. The cup is made by a Scottish startup , and is essentially a 100-calorie vegan biscuit in the shape of a cup. Made with wafer in much the same way as an ice cream cone, the cup will stay leak-proof for 12 hours, and even more amazingly, crunchy for a full 45 minutes, which for the American readers is exactly and always one-half the duration of a ‘football’ match. According to the company’s website, the cup is fully recyclable, but the taste of coffee-soaked wafer cup is actually delectable. The football club is also offering fully recyclable beer cups made of recycled paper and cardboard. There are with making a fully recyclable paper takeaway hot drinks cup, and it’s why there still isn’t one today in the largest beverage chains. The combination of a heatproof inner lining and paper together make the cups very tricky to recycle, as the two very different materials must be separated. Edible cups truly might be the best solution, provided firms like BioBite can bring the cost-per-unit down. 240 of their biscuit cups cost $111 before VAT, about 14 cents more than for the cup, the plastic lid, and the wood stirrer. Other firms are closer to the mark, like Bulgarian edible coffee cup maker , who make (including taxes) wafer cup with about the same properties as BioBites. For eco-conscious consumers, the lack of lid is not an issue provided they enjoy the coffee on foot. It’s well-suited to European city centers made for walking about, but rather inconvenient in most of America, set up as the country is for driving. Another limiting factor is that a wafer is not exactly the fuel of a healthy society. If there were a company that could make the wafers out of some kind of vegetable fiber, something many western diets are nutritionally deficient in, then you’re talking about a real revolution.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/manchester-city-stadium-offers-edible-hot-beverage-cups/
"The widest, and perhaps oldest single coral in the Great Barrier Reef has been discovered—and it’s in excellent health. Those are the findings of a new paper published in which reported the discovery of Muga dhambi, or “big coral” in the language of the Manbarra people, the traditional custodians of the Palm Islands, off of which the research team found the coral. Discovered near Goolboodi (Orpheus Island) in March 2021, the hemispherical Muga dhambi measured 5.3 meters tall (17 feet) and 10.4 meters wide (34 feet), making it the widest and sixth-tallest coral in the 2,900 reefs that make up the barrier system. “We were running a citizen science workshop… and were interested in exploring the North Coast of Goolbodhi which is a very remote area often restricted by weather,” Kaillash Cook, part of the workshop team and co-author of the new paper, told in an email. “It was here Dr. Adam Smith found this breathtaking coral and instantly assigned people to take measurements, surveys, and coordinates for the coral.” Belonging to the genus Muga dhambi is from one of 16 common coral species that form some of the largest and most important building blocks of nearshore corals, report Adam Smith and the rest of the team behind the research. Nevertheless, after consultation with tribal elders, it was determined that the coral was completely unknown by the Manbarra people, who were asked to give it a name, being that it resided in their sea-country. Other enormous have been found in the American Samoa, in the reef around the Green Island off the coast of Taiwan, and Sesoko Island, Okinawa. Based on yearly growth models, Muga dhambi was estimated at between 421 and 438 years old, an astonishing age to live to amid an ecosystem that’s described as a canary in a coal mine for climate change. “For shallow water corals, 438 year-old corals are very hard to come by,” cook admitted. “Australian Institute of Marine Sciences has investigated 328 colonies of massive corals on the Great Barrier Reef and the oldest they have found is 436 years old.” “While the age is currently an estimate based on measurements of other corals we can safely say that Muga dhambi is one of the oldest structures on the Great Barrier Reef,” said Cook. “After a torrid few years, the of the Great Barrier Reef has found that while COVID ran rampant above, the reef’s own pandemic, coral bleaching, was hardly noticeable, and hard coral cover increased across all three regions of the reef over the last year. A review of the environmental events that have occurred in the past 450 years indicates that Muga dhambi may have survived up to 80 major cyclones and centuries of exposure to invasive species, perhaps 100 coral bleaching events, low tides and human activity. The researchers report that Muga dhambi is in very good health with 70% consisting of live coral, the rest being covered with the green boring sponge, , turf algae, and green algae. “We found that about 30% of the colony was dead which is a completely natural and healthy occurrence as it supported the growth of turf algae, turtle weed, and sponge which all play important roles in the ecosystem,” said Cook. “This diversity of benthos meant that lots of fish were attracted to hide in the coral structure, feed off the turf algae and turn Muga dhambi into a thriving microecosystem.” “This field note provides important geospatial, environmental, and cultural information of a rare coral that can be monitored, appreciated, potentially restored and hopefully inspire future generations to care more for our reefs and culture,” write the authors",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/438-year-old-coral-discovered-in-the-great-barrier-reef/

With measurements of its density paired with its 140 mile-diameter, recent telescopic surveys with different spectrums of UV light have confirmed the asteroid to be around 90% iron, adding the last value in the equation to give 16 Psyche its . Sitting 230 million miles from Earth, it offers a much different kind of value to scientists, namely to study one of the largest entirely-metal objects in the solar system, one which scientists believe could be a protoplanet that was disrupted during natural formation. It’s now the subject of a that will send an orbiter on a 3.5 year-mission to study a new type of world made of metal. The orbiter will try to determine whether it’s simply a mass of iron and nickel, or indeed a planet’s core, as well as its age, and whether it can contain lighter elements found in Earth’s high-pressure core. “We’ve seen meteorites that are mostly metal, but Psyche could be unique in that it might be an asteroid that is totally made of iron and nickel,” Dr. Tracy Becker, an expert on 16 Psyche from the Southwest Research Institute. “Earth has a metal core, a mantle and crust. It’s possible that as a Psyche protoplanet was forming, it was struck by another object in our solar system and lost its mantle and crust.” Becker, who published a UV-light observation study of the asteroid last year, considers it a chance “to understand what really makes up a planet and to potentially see the inside of a planet.” But how is it that so much heavy metal should congregate outside of a festival ground in Germany? Vice President of Arizona State University’s interplanetary initiative, Lindy Elkins-Tanton, spoke with in early July to explain. “It’s not the Death Star,” says Elkins-Tanton. “It turns out that we know this from meteorites; that the most primitive material, the building blocks of planets [are] little bits of metal and little bits of rock all mixed together.” “And when you put all that material clumped together into a [a tiny planet] they’re heated up by early short lived radioisotopes,” she said. This melting forces the metal down, as it’s denser than the comparatively porous rocky material present on the asteroid or planet, forming the metallic core. “We’ve got a big clump of metal, our core, inside of the Earth,” said Elkins-Tanton. “There’s one inside of the Moon, amazingly, inside of Mars, inside of Mercury, inside of Venus, but we never, ever get to see them. So Psyche gives us, we think, a way to see the core of a planetesimal, maybe the only way humans will ever see a core if our ideas are right.” This would be the true price tag of 16 Psyche, because even if we could somehow bring back all that iron, the supply-demand laws of economics would bring the price of iron down to levels in the hundredths of a cent.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/16-psyche-asteroid-value-as-a-protoplanetary-core-and-a-huge-piece-of-iron/
"On a farm where cows freely relieve themselves as they graze, the accumulation and spread of waste often contaminates local soil and waterways. This can be controlled by confining the cows in barns, but in these close quarters their urine and feces combine to create ammonia, an indirect greenhouse gas. In an article published on September 13 in the journal , researchers show that cows can be potty-trained, enabling waste to be collected and treated, thereby cleaning up the barn, reducing air pollution, and creating more open, animal-friendly farms. “It’s usually assumed that cattle are not capable of controlling defecation or urination,” says co-author Jan Langbein, an animal psychologist at the Research Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN) in Germany, but he and his team questioned this thinking. “Cattle, like many other animals or farm animals are quite clever and they can learn a lot. Why shouldn’t they be able to learn how to use a toilet?” To potty-train the calves, a process they dubbed MooLoo training, the research team with scientists from FBN, FLI (Germany) and the University of Auckland (New Zealand) worked backward. They started off by rewarding the calves when they urinated in the latrine, and then they allowed the calves to approach the latrines from outside when they needed to urinate. The ammonia produced in cow waste doesn’t directly contribute to climate change, but when it is leached into the soil, microbes convert it into nitrous oxide, the third-most important greenhouse gas after methane and carbon dioxide. Agriculture is the largest source of ammonia emissions, with livestock farming making up over half of that contribution. “You have to try to include the animals in the process and train the animals to follow what they should learn,” says Langbein. “We guessed it should be possible to train the animals, but to what extent we didn’t know.” To encourage latrine use, the researchers wanted the calves to associate urination outside the latrine with an unpleasant experience. “As a punishment we first used in-ear headphones and we played a very nasty sound whenever they urinated outside,” says Langbein. “We thought this would punish the animals—not too aversively—but they didn’t care. Ultimately, a splash of water worked well as a gentle deterrent.” Over the course of a few weeks, the research team successfully trained 11 out of the 16 calves in the experiment—which has been published in . Remarkably, the calves showed a level of performance comparable to that of children and superior to that of very young children. Langbein is optimistic that with more training that this success rate can be further improved. “After ten, fifteen, twenty years of researching with cattle, we know that animals have a personality, and they handle different things in a different way. They are not all the same.” Now that the researchers know how to potty-train cows, they want to transfer their results into real cattle housing and to outdoor systems. Langbein hopes that “in a few years all cows will go to a toilet,” he says.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cows-potty-trained-save-planet-germany/
"At age 6, Chad Keller already knew he wanted to be an astronaut, but his vision wasn’t sharp enough to pass the military requirements to become a fighter pilot. Instead, never losing sight of his dream, Keller pursued a degree in aerospace engineering, hoping to someday make it into space. On September 11, 2001 the 29-year-old U.S. Department of Defense and National Reconnaissance Office satellite propulsion specialist was on his way home to California after attending a series of launch meetings at the Pentagon. At 9:37 a.m., the plane he was on—American Airlines Flight 77—crashed into the Pentagon. Keller’s life ended that day, but thanks to the efforts of NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy, close to 20 years on, his space mission dreams were finally made a reality. A former Navy SEAL platoon commander, Cassidy spent two tours in the Middle East in the aftermath of 9/11. He began training to become an astronaut in 2004 at the end of his second deployment. Cassidy’s NASA career highlights include crewing aboard the Endeavor shuttle in 2009, two tours on the International Space station, and 10 spacewalks. According to Cassidy, NASA allows astronauts to bring a selection of small personal keepsakes—such as photos, patches, or pins—along with them on their missions. For his first two space outings, Cassidy concentrated on mementos from his family but for his final mission in 2020, he wanted to share the unique and meaningful opportunity with someone who’d truly appreciate it. After reading about Chad Keller’s lifelong passion for space travel at New York City’s National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Cassidy knew he’d found a kindred spirit. Cassidy reached out to Keller’s father, Richard, with a proposition: He was heading into space soon and wondered if Chad would like to tag along. Richard’s answer was a resounding, “Yes!” On April 2020, when Cassidy and the rest of his crew lifted off, pins from Chad’s days at Boeing and the University of Colorado, a program from his memorial service, a snapshot of Chad and his wife Lisa, and some of his ashes went with him. To round out the collection, Cassidy also brought commemorative items from the 9/11 Museum. Over the course of the mission, with a stunning backdrop of the Earth behind them, Cassidy photographed each item from his inventory in the space station’s observatory cupola. Along with documenting moments in history, he also sent out messages of hope to the people on the planet below. “With each item that I pull out, I always pause for a second to think a little bit about the story to that particular item,” Cassidy told . “It’s kind of special to think about the story and the path, the journey of that object from the hands that it was in to my hands to this window.” In the 20 years since Chad Keller’s passing, his family had a mission of their own—to scatter his ashes at the places that held the greatest meaning to him. Thanks to Cassidy, they were finally able to send them to the one place he’d always most wanted to go—space. Now retired from NASA, Cassidy is currently overseeing the construction of the National Medal of Honor Museum and Medal of Honor Leadership Institute in Arlington, Texas, and the National Medal of Honor Monument in Washington, D.C. While Cassidy and the Kellers have yet to meet in person, the bond they forged in bringing Chad’s dream to life is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of tragedy; one told from a perspective that’s both humbling and hopeful. “The world would be a better place if every human being got five minutes to look out that window of the space station,” Cassidy told CNN. “It made me more appreciative for everything that Earth offers to us. Friendships, connections, and shared experiences are all that much more meaningful to me now.” And that is a take-away that’s universal. “The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be,” Carl Sagan wrote. If we can simply remember that we’re part of something larger than ourselves, then whether we’re earthbound or breaking the bonds of gravity, in the here and now or part of what’s come before, all of us are sailing among the stars.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/astronaut-brings-ashes-and-photos-of-9-11-victim-to-space-fulfilling-his-lifelong-dream-of-orbiting-for-nasa/
"When a much-loved aunt passes away, how do you pay homage? If you’re one Australian farmer, you involve your sheep in the most moving way. Farmer Ben Jackson was stuck in lockdown in New South Wales. Unable to make the funeral of his aunty Deb after she lost her battle with cancer in Brisbane, he wanted to convey the impact she’d had on his life. “Unfortunately, she didn’t make it,” Jackson said, according to . “At those times of grief, you feel really helpless, you don’t know what to do, what to say. Then, while out feeding his pregnant sheep some extra food, an idea came to him. He’d seen before that if he drew shapes in the land, the sheep would gather. It took a few attempts, but the final resulting footage, taken by drone, is absolutely beautiful. Ben and a mob of singles organised a tribute to his Aunty “It was certainly something that she would have loved and absolutely cherished,” said Jackson. With the short film set to Simon and Garfunkel’s , you genuinely might want to get the tissues ready before pressing play on this one.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/sheep-love-heart-video-australia/
"Singing lullabies can not only improve the health of premature babies during intensive care but can lift their anxious family too, according to new research. Gentle music therapy slows down the heart rate of prematurely delivered infants—and also helps them to feed and sleep better, say scientists. New research into live music helping new mothers and family members has shown rhythmic strings or humming helps with therapeutic or care procedures. While playing sad songs may seem to be the antithesis of what scared parents may need at a time when their baby is in the intensive care unit, medical staff have said the impact of these songs were positive. It is thought playing songs about death, heartbreak, or other difficult times helps parents process their feelings and a sign of life from outside the hospital, too. Taru Koivisto, a doctoral student at UniArts Helsinki, said she worked with other professional musicians in hospitals and saw the playing of live instruments helped both mother and baby with healing—physically and mentally. She said, “A moment of music can create an intimate atmosphere where the parents can forget about treatments, tubes, and machines and put their entire focus on their baby and truly see them. “For the parents, music was a sign of life from outside of the hospital and helped them understand that life will carry on even in hard times,” Koivisto says. When a family’s premature infant goes into intensive care, their life may be changed permanently. Ms Koivisto added, “Music moments were described as a break that allowed the whole family to metaphorically travel to another space or place. “A shared musical journey together may have helped the family members create a new narrative for their life. “In one of the example situations, a mother of a baby asked her own mother, the grandmother of the baby, whether the song she chose was too emotional for her. “The grandmother said ‘no’. When they sang the song together, the grandmother started crying, but the mother of the child was content in her own way.” Other live therapeutic studies have shown gentle music therapy like singing lullabies can influence cardiac and respiratory function in newborns. Previous research found babies who receive this kind of therapy leave the hospital sooner. The findings were published in the journal",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/singing-lullabies-not-only-improves-the-health-of-premature-babies/
"The Chesapeake Bay has, despite massive setbacks, continued to return to something resembling a healthy estuarine ecosystem, in no small part because of the dedicated scientists who study it. As the most extensively studied estuary on Earth, the Chesapeake’s 11,000 miles of coastline play host to a familiar story of competition between short-term economic interests, and long-term ecological ones. There may have been a time when the two most important species, oysters and seagrass, would have ceased to exist if pollution continued as it had done, but regulation reduced the dead-zones and brought fish, oysters, and seagrass . Now teams of scientists are working to speed the recovery of these keystone species, often by hand, reasoning that as ecosystem engineers, oysters and seagrass can begin to do the scientists’ work for them if they can only propagate to the required numbers. As the principal polluting agents were nutrient runoff from farms in the surrounding states, and pollutants flowing in from the cities, regulating storm drains and incentivizing farmers to reduce runoff resulted in a 316% increase in seagrass beds between 1984 and 2015. Oysters, too, are recovering through the diligent work of people like Romuald Lipcius, professor of fisheries science at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. He’s worked in the Bay for over 16 years—helping oysters recover, live longer, and perform more of their all-important filter feeding. Using fossil oyster shells, safe artificial substrate, or concrete Lipcius and his colleagues are creating safe and optimal habitat for them to grow, and are seeing three-dimensional oyster beds as a result. In Baines Creek, a tributary of the Elizabeth River in Virginia, oysters are reaching the age of five—once thought impossible due to the diseases that pollution made so commonplace in the Bay. “All these oysters peeking above the water is a beautiful sight,” Rowan Lockwood at William & Mary College “It is a glimpse of what the Bay was like 6,000 years ago.” In the Rappahannock River, also in Virginia, a retired Naval officer had used oyster castles to cultivate millions of oysters that regularly reached the age of seven. Between five and seven is when the fecundity of oysters is highest, and they release the most larva. Out in the Bay, his continued interest in restoring the oyster unveiled some “relict reefs” that had survived from pre-colonial times. “The relict reefs and artificial reefs are telling us without a doubt that oyster restoration can succeed,” says Lipcius. “I have always believed that we know how to restore the oysters; we are just choosing not to,” adds Lockwood. Oysters aren’t the only species that are getting a helping hand. In 2018, after the prolific rise of seagrass acreage in the Bay, record rainfall swept enormous quantities of sediment down off the surrounding farms. The nitrogen and phosphorus was lapped up by algae blooms which blocked the sun from reaching the seagrass, and as a result 38% of the eelgrass species was lost. “Seagrass is one of the key foundation habitats in the Chesapeake Bay, and in shallow coastal marine systems worldwide,” says Chris Patrick, also at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences. “It anchors the sediment, it clears the water, it allows small particles to drift down and become entrained.” Patrick and his team are looking to speed up the process of seagrass recovery by manually planting seagrass seeds, and harvesting the seed bearing shoots of two different species, eelgrass and widgeon grass, in May. Filtering the sediment out of the seeds, they take the finest quality seeds and plant them in autumn. Compared to last year, it’s Patrick’s estimate that his planting operations will result in four times as much grass next year. Patrick and Lipcius work hard for small gains, but fortunately for them the species they’re working to save are better at cleaning and protecting the Bay than even the most die-hard marine biologists, and for each blade of eelgrass or each happy oyster they add to the Chesapeake, they add one more dedicated worker to the project of restoring the Bay to its glorious and bountiful heritage.

"A young Irishman has come up with his own “cool science-y method” to solve the microplastic pollution conundrum, winning Google’s international science fair in the process. By mixing magnetized iron oxide and vegetable oil, he created a kind of liquid magnet that collects microplastics which can then be removed via magnetism, leaving only glistening water behind. There’s nothing like growing up in a pristine environment to galvanize a person to its defense, and a feature on young Fionn Ferreira from the south of Ireland details how since the age of 12, he has been looking to find a solution for the hard-to-clean microplastics he knew accompanied the growing amount of plastic garbage that tended to wash up on the beaches he frequented during childhood. “I was at our beach and I saw a rock and it had oil spill residue on it, and stuck to this oil spill residue were plastic particles,” says Fionn in a for the Plastic Soup Foundation. “I asked myself why is this happening, and I found out that plastic particles are what we call non-polar, and oil is non-polar too. In chemistry likes attract likes, which means non-polar things attract non-polar things.” He heard of something called ferrofluid, which was a kind of magnetic water by combining vegetable oil with magnetized iron oxide powder. In the same video presentation, he shows that oil attracted the microplastics, and the immersion of a magnet sucked up the lot. “I started out as a lonely inventor,” Ferreira told the . “After the Google Science Fair, I could all of a sudden speak to scientists—they gave me credit for what I had done. My idea was no longer a toy invented by a child.” Indeed after 5,000 tests it was shown that his method could clean 87%-93% of microplastics from the water, despite the fact that the microplastics came from a variety of sources like car tires, plastic bottles, and laundry water. He demonstrated his method at the 2019 Google Science Fair and won a $50,000 scholarship, which he used to go and study chemistry at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Fionn is now trying to fit his method into a device that can span the opening of a home waterpipe, or the pipes at a wastewater plant, allowing the ferrofluid to continuously clean water that moves through it, as well as a different machine that can be mounted on boats. “He observed and tackled a problem he saw locally which has vast global significance,” Larissa Kelly, Ferreira’s former science teacher at Schull Community College told the BBC. “His invention, based on very simple components, is groundbreaking. It has powerful potential to provide solutions that will contribute to the worldwide effort to remove microplastics from the environment.” ( the video for this story below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/fionn-ferreira-won-google-science-fair-2019-with-microplastic-cleaning-fluid/
"The internet makes it easy for criminals to reach out from anywhere to illegally obtain your money or personal data—and a retired police officer is pointing out some of the most dubious ways scammers use smart phones to trick innocent people. Dave has spoken directly with hundreds of scammers in an attempt to understand what they do, so he can help the public avoid falling prey to their frauds. Their ploys are varied, and sophisticated enough to be convincing even to the most savvy people. Dave, who resides in Canada, received a call from a number disguised as if it were a local caller. When he answered, a voice told him that he was in trouble unless he spoke with a government agent about his bank account. The caller pretended to be with the investigations department of Service Canada. In this case, the scammer told Dave that his accounts were connected with serious crimes. In the US, many scammers identify themselves as being with the FBI. The scammer even set up a fake call with a local police officer, while he waited on hold. : Together, the thieving tag-team explained that Dave’s money needed to be moved to a secure government account. Dave’s advice is that you should never engage with these scammers. One correct piece of data, even a first name or your correct city, can be used with your phone number to find you on social media and gather even more information. If the call seems real, ask for a name and then hang up. Use a different phone to call the agency or bank directly to verify the caller’s identity. Always look up a bank or police department number yourself, instead of dialing one provided by the caller. Police will never call somebody on the phone to threaten arrest. Your bank will never call and ask you to divulge information. And government agencies will not call you to help you secure your funds. Sometimes, scammers will hijack your phone and your verification call to any number will be rerouted to them without you knowing it was done. If you understand the scam and you refuse to provide any information or follow any instructions, you will be less likely to ever be the victim of one of these scams.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/retired-officer-engages-with-scammers-to-expose-schemes/
"Our partner Rob Brezsny provides his weekly wisdom to enlighten our thinking and motivate our mood. Rob’s , is a syndicated weekly column appearing in over a hundred publications. He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): According to Leo author , “We are in the habit of using our eyes only with the memory of what people before us have thought about the things we are looking at.” That’s too bad. It causes us to miss a lot of life’s richness. In fact, said de Maupassant, “There is an element of the unexplored in everything. The smallest thing contains a little of what is unknown.” Your assignment in the next two weeks, Leo, is to take his thoughts to heart. In every experience, engage “with enough attention to find an aspect of it that no one has ever seen or spoken of.” You are in a phase when you could discover and enjoy record-breaking levels of novelty. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Poet wrote a poem I want you to know about. She described how, when she was a child, she stayed up all night picking peaches from her father’s orchard by starlight. For hours, she climbed up and down the ladder. Her hands “twisted fruit” as if she “were entering a thousand doors.” When the stars faded and morning arrived, her insides felt like “the stillness a bell possesses just after it has been rung.” That’s the kind of experience I wish for you in the coming days, Virgo. I know it can’t be exactly the same. Can you imagine what the nearest equivalent might be? Make it happen! LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Ancient Greek philosopher mistrusted laughter, poetry, bright colors, and artists who used bright colors. All those soulful activities influenced people to be emotional, Plato thought, and therefore represented a threat to rational, orderly society. Wow! I’m glad I don’t live in a culture descended from Plato! Oh, wait, I do. His writing is foundational to Western thought. One modern philosopher declared, “The European philosophical tradition consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.” Anyway, I’m counseling you to rebel against Plato in the coming weeks. You especially need experiences that awaken and please and highlight your feelings. Contrary to Plato’s fears, doing this will boost your intelligence and enhance your decision-making powers. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): A biography of Nobel Prize-winning Scorpio author noted that he had two modes. They are summed up in the French words (“unity”) and (“solitary”). When Camus was in a phase, he immersed himself in convivial engagement, enjoying the pleasures of socializing. But when he decided it was time to work hard on writing his books, he retreated into a monastic routine to marshal intense creativity. According to my astrological analysis, you Scorpios are currently in the phase of your rhythm. Enjoy it to the max! When might the next phase come? October could be such a time. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): During the 76 years since the end of World War II, Italy has had 69 different governments. That’s a great deal of turnover! Is it a strength or weakness to have so many changes in leadership? On the one hand, such flexibility could be an asset; it might be wise to keep reinventing the power structure as circumstances shift. On the other hand, having so little continuity and stability may undermine confidence and generate stressful uncertainty. I bring this to your attention, Sagittarius, because you’re entering a phase when you could be as changeable as Italy. Is that what you want? Would it serve you or undermine you? Make a conscious choice. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Capricorn actor Nicholas Browne testifies, “My heart is too full; it overflows onto everything I see. I am drowning in my own heart. I’ve plunged into the deepness of emotion, and I don’t see any way back up. Still, I pray no one comes to save me.” I’m guessing that his profound capacity to feel and express emotions serves Browne well in his craft. While I don’t recommend such a deep immersion for you 24/7/365, I suspect you’ll be wise to embark on such an excursion during the next three weeks. Have fun diving! How deep can you go? AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): In accordance with current astrological omens, I’m calling on author to offer you a message. Is it infused with tough love or sweet encouragement? Both! Here’s Katie: “When you realize that suffering and discomfort are the call to inquiry, you may actually begin to look forward to uncomfortable feelings. You may even experience them as friends coming to show you what you have not yet investigated thoroughly enough.” Get ready to dive deeper than you’ve dared to go before, Aquarius. I guarantee you it will ultimately become fun and educational. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): In August 1922, author wrote this triumphant declaration: “All day today I’ve had the most gentle, quivering joy, because I’m beginning to heal. Consciously, happily, I feel that I am being born anew, that I am beginning once again to take possession of the light.” On behalf of the cosmic powers-that-be, I authorize you to use these words as your own in the coming weeks. They capture transformations that are in the works for you. By speaking Kazantzakis’s declarations aloud several times every day, you will ensure that his experience will be yours, too. ARIES (March 21-April 19): “Consecrate” isn’t a word you often encounter in intellectual circles. In my home country of America, many otherwise smart people spurn the possibility that we might want to make things sacred. And a lot of art aspires to do the opposite of consecration: strip the world of holiness and mock the urge to commune with sanctified experiences. But filmmaker (1922–1975) expressed a contradictory view. He wrote, “I am not interested in deconsecrating: that’s a fashion I hate. I want to reconsecrate things as much as possible, I want to re-mythicize them.” In accordance with astrological omens, Aries, I invite you to look for opportunities to do the same. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Anais Nin wrote, “I don’t want worship. I want understanding.” George Orwell said, “Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.” Poet Marina Tsvetaeva declared, “For as long as I can remember, I thought I wanted to be loved. Now I know: I don’t need love, I need understanding.” Here’s what I’ll add, Taurus: If you ask for understanding and seek it out, a wealth of it will be available to you in the coming weeks. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): The English idiom “playing hard to get” means “pretending to be unavailable or uninterested so as to make oneself more attractive or desirable.” Psychologists say this strategy often works, although it’s crucial not to go too far and make your pursuer lose interest. 17th-century philosopher expressed the concept more philosophically. He said, “Leave people hungry. Even with physical thirst, good taste’s trick is to stimulate it, not quench it. What’s good, if sparse, is twice as good. A surfeit of pleasure is dangerous, for it occasions disdain even towards what’s undisputedly excellent. Hard-won happiness is twice as enjoyable.” I suggest you consider deploying these strategies, Gemini. CANCER (June 21-July 22): Painter John Singer Sargent sometimes worked alongside painter Claude Monet at Monet’s home. He sought the older man’s guidance. Before their first session, Sargent realized there was no black among the paint colors Monet gave him to work with. What?! Monet didn’t use black? Sargent was shocked. He couldn’t imagine painting without it. And yet, he did fine without it. In fact, the apparent limitation compelled him to be creative in ways he hadn’t previously imagined.

"“Nutritious ancestral plant of the Mayans, its flowers a treasure, a small but powerful grain; eat the leaf and the grain, which is ideal for roasting and making popcorn.” This brief description, on a website translated from Spanish, belittles the grand potential and grander history of a humble but potential superfood that could replace nutrient-deficient grains across the developing world. The first growers of the grain called amaranth were the always ahead-of-their-time Mayan peoples of Central and South America. It was also cultivated by the Aztecs. When Spanish conquerors  arrived in the 1600s, they threatened anyone seen growing amaranth, because the spiritual connection they had to the plant was thought to undermine Christianity, according to a recent article in Now free from such persecution, the ancestors of Mesoamerican peoples across Latin America are bringing this once-common crop to the attention of the world’s markets. A source of all nine essential amino acids, as well as several key minerals like iron and magnesium, amaranth is a pseudo-cereal, lying somewhere between a seed and grain, like buckwheat or quinoa—and, . Additionally, it’s now being grown and marketed in high-end products for the , and health food stores, in far-flung places like South Asia, China, India, West Africa, and the Caribbean. With nearly 75 species in the Amaranthus genus, some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables, some for grain, and some for ornamental plants that you may have planted in your garden. : Densely packed flower clusters and stems grow in a range of striking pigments, from maroon and crimson to ochre and lime, and can grow from 3 to 8 feet tall. Some of them are summer annual weeds, commonly referred to as pigweeds. The total value, since the 1970s when amaranth first began appearing on the shelves of stores, has ballooned into a global trade that’s now valued at $5.8 billion. And, one Pueblo woman from New Mexico thinks it has the potential to feed the entire world. Much of the revival of traditional amaranth cultivation methods, which involve saving the seeds of the best plants, similar to corn cultivation by Mexico’s have created a seriously-resilient crop. A from the detailing the rise of weeds resistant to the Monsanto herbicide “Roundup,” explained that amaranth, considered a weed by some, displayed such resistance. Organizations like Qachoo Aluum in Guatemala, a Mayan word for Mother Earth, , and host workshops to help indigenous communities regain food security through ancestral methods of cultivation. Regain is a key word here because, as article details, government forces had been persecuting the Mayan population and burning their fields. Farmers kept amaranth seeds in secret jars buried underground, and when the two-decade war ended, the remaining agriculturalists began to spread the seed, and the growing methods, across the countryside. : Qachoo Aluum rose from the ashes of this conflict, thanks to more than 400 families from 24 Guatemalan villages, who have been traveling every year to the United States to share their ancestral knowledge about the crop to predominantly indigenous and Latin-language garden centers. “Amaranth has completely changed the lives of families in our communities, not only economically, but spiritually,” said Maria Aurelia Xitumul, a Mayan descendent and member of the Qachoo Aluum community since 2006. The interchange of seeds—a vital part of healthy ag systems, has revived friendly connections between the Guatemalan Qachoo Aluum and their New Mexican Pueblo relatives. : “We’ve always viewed our seed relatives as and kin,” said Tsosie-Peña, who believes the resilient, nutritious plant can feed the world. A perfect plant for drought-prone regions, amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development, and support sustainable land care.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/amaranth-health-trend-that-could-feed-world/
"A serendipitous series of events turned an 11-year-old boy into a stalwart hero, after a dying man gave him a tent. Last year, just before the pandemic reached the UK, Max Woosey’s parents were helping to care for a neighbor, Rick Abbott, who had terminal cancer. They came to appreciate how vital it was that the local hospice in North Devon was able to help their neighbor remain in his own home, which was his final wish. Just before he died, Abbott gave Max a gift. “My friend Rick gave me his tent before he died and made me promise to go have an adventure.” Max realized that most of the fundraising for the hospice was cancelled and services were closed due to COVID-19, so on March 29th, 2020, he began sleeping in his new tent pitched in the backyard, hoping to raise £100 for the hospice. With his plush stuffed animals to keep him cozy, he posted updates on his fundraising page, while waiting for the pandemic to be over. As lockdown restrictions dragged on, and warm summer nights turned into chilly autumn frost, Max refused to come in from the cold—and . On October 12, he wrote, “Thank you so much for all the donations. I can’t believe how much I have raised. I have decided to camp out for a year to see if I can get to £20,000.” The boy blew past that goal, hitting milestones of 100 consecutive days, then 200 days, then 300 days. : His dog Digby was more than welcome to spend the night and keep this Cub Scout warm through the nights. During one December storm, his tent blew over but he repitched it so he could cross-off another day on his calendar. His dad kept him company during Storm Bella and its 70mph winds. He even had to get a new tent when the first one sprung a leak. When Christmas season arrived, the family decorated his tent with lights and santa ornaments. Sleeping outside, maybe he hoped to catch a glimpse of the red-suited guy when his sleigh flew by. Max’s mission attracted national and international media attention and he was invited to camp next to the lion’s enclosure at London zoo and in the Downing Street garden, according to . Last week, the boy from Braunton celebrated his 500th consecutive night on an adventure that was spurred on by tragedy but raised more than $770,000 from strangers around the world for the life-giving service of hospice.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/boy-raises-700k-for-hospice-by-camping-out-500-nights/
"Most of us remember a time when we could eat anything we wanted and not gain weight. But a new study suggests your metabolism—the rate at which you burn calories—actually starts its inevitable decline much later than we all assumed. Additionally, we tend to think of our teens and 20s as the age when our calorie-burning potential hits its peak. But the researchers found that, pound for pound, infants had the highest metabolic rates of all. Duke University associate professor Herman Pontzer joined an international team of scientists to analyze the average calories burned by more than 6,600 people ranging in age from one week to 95 as they went about their daily lives in 29 countries worldwide. Focusing on puberty, menopause, and other phases of life, Pontzer, the study’s co-author was surprised. “What’s weird is that the timing of our ‘metabolic life stages’ doesn’t seem to match those typical milestones.” Previously, most large-scale studies measured how much energy the body uses to perform basic vital functions such as breathing, digesting, pumping blood—in other words, the calories you need just to stay alive. But that amounts to only 50% to 70% of the calories we burn each day. It doesn’t take into account the energy we spend doing everything else: washing the dishes, walking the dog, breaking a sweat at the gym, even just thinking or fidgeting. To come up with a number for total daily energy expenditure, the researchers relied on the “doubly labeled water” method. It’s a urine test that involves having a person drink water in which the hydrogen and oxygen in the water molecules have been replaced with naturally occurring “heavy” forms, and then measuring how quickly they’re flushed out. Scientists have used the technique—considered the gold standard for measuring daily energy expenditure during normal daily life, outside of the lab— to measure energy expenditure in humans since the 1980s, but studies have been limited in size and scope due to cost. So multiple labs decided to share their data and gather their measurements in a single database, to see if they could tease out truths that weren’t revealed or were only hinted at in previous work. Pooling and analyzing energy expenditures across the entire lifespan revealed some surprises, including the data showing that babies have the highest metabolic rates of all. During the first 12 months of an infant’s life, their energy needs shoot upward, such that by their first birthday, a one-year-old burns calories 50% faster for their body size than an adult. And that’s not just because, in their first year, infants are busy tripling their birth weight. “Of course they’re growing, but even once you control for that, their energy expenditures are rocketing up higher than you’d expect for their body size and composition,” said Pontzer, author of a book on the science of metabolism, . An infant’s gas-guzzling metabolism may partly explain why children who don’t get enough to eat during this developmental window are less likely to survive and grow up to be healthy adults. “Something is happening inside a baby’s cells to make them more active, and we don’t know what those processes are yet,” Pontzer said. After this initial surge in infancy, the data show that metabolism slows by about 3% each year until we reach our 20s, when it levels off into a new normal. Despite the teen years being a time of growth spurts, the researchers didn’t see any uptick in daily calorie needs in adolescence after they took body size into account. “We really thought puberty would be different and it’s not,” said Pontzer. : Midlife was another surprise. Perhaps you’ve been told that it’s all downhill after 30 when it comes to your weight. But while several factors could explain the thickening waistlines that often emerge during our prime working years, the findings suggest that a changing metabolism isn’t one of them. In fact, the researchers discovered that energy expenditures during these middle decades—our 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s—were the most stable. Even during pregnancy, a woman’s calorie needs were no more or less than expected given her added bulk as the baby grows. The data suggest that our metabolisms don’t really start to decline again until after age 60. The slowdown is gradual, only 0.7% a year. But a person in their 90s needs 26% fewer calories each day than someone in midlife. : Lost muscle mass as we get older may be partly to blame, the researchers say, since muscle burns more calories than fat. But it’s not the whole picture. “We controlled for muscle mass,” Pontzer said. “It’s because their cells are slowing down.” The patterns held even when differing activity levels were taken into account, according to the research, which was published August 12 in and funded by the National Science Foundation and IAEA. For a long time, what drives shifts in energy expenditure has been difficult to parse because aging goes hand in hand with so many other changes, Pontzer said. But the research lends support to the idea that it’s more than age-related changes in lifestyle or body composition. “All of this points to the conclusion that tissue metabolism, the work that the cells are doing, is changing over the course of the lifespan in ways we haven’t fully appreciated before,” Pontzer said. “You really need a big data set like this to get at those questions.” (Source: ) – File photo by Emma Simpson",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/metabolism-does-not-slow-down-in-midlife-adulthood/
"If in mid-summer you went onto the top of the Grocery Outlet supermarket in Stockton, California, and placed your hand on the strange, glossy black panels you found there, you’d be shocked to find they were as cold to the touch as a basement fuse box. Installed by a company called SkyCool Systems, they are the first of a new breed of cooling technologies that radiate heat out through the atmosphere, lowering nearby air temperatures by about 10°F. Radiative cooling is what happens when the electromagnetic waves we call heat leave an object. It’s the phenomenon that puts you at risk for heat stroke in the desert during the day, and hypothermia at night; the absorbed heat evacuates the landscape at sundown, and without any moisture to trap it, leaves through Earth’s atmosphere into outer space. A UCLA scientist reasoned that if a certain spectrum of warming rays is radiated out to the atmosphere during the day, it would cool whatever it left, potentially offering an alternative to traditional air conditioning. An estimated 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions are generated through cooling systems, both for homes and transport, but as global temperatures continue to climb, the use of cooling systems for homes and businesses is expected to triple over the coming years. can absorb all the heat-producing light from the sun, and rather than sending it back into the swirling cauldron of gasses that are heating the planet, expels it out into space. Aaswath Raman, a materials scientists at the University of California LA, discovered that radiative cooling technologies like panels and special reflective paints had been investigated before but then abandoned as impossible. The idea was that if something could radiate heat even in broad daylight, it could save thousands in refrigeration costs. Raman decided to submit a funding proposal to the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, a branch of the Department of Energy. Despite the quilt of material and all the water vapor and CO2 that make up the atmosphere, infrared radiation between 8 to 13 micrometers in length passes through it as if it weren’t there, so Raman aimed to creative a film that reflected visible light, and which radiated the infrared light which can leave the atmosphere, ensuring the heat he disperses doesn’t become someone else’s problem. With colleagues from the Stanford engineering department led by Shanhui Fan, he created an ultra-thin film, which he says could be produced in rolls a meter long by two-meters wide, made of silica, glass, and hafnium dioxide, a coating agent used in the optics industry. Placed on a rooftop, became warmer when shaded from the sun’s rays—a counter-intuitive reaction to what one would expect, because the radiation was impeded by the material generating the shade. Furthermore, under the blazing summer sun, the panel was cool to the touch. If placed on the hood of a car, the film would not only reflect any light from the sun, but radiate away some of the heat from the engine; if placed above where water pipes run through a building, it would cool the water therein, reducing the load on air-conditioning systems. After a trip to Mumbai in India revealed the speed at which the home A/C market is growing, Raman needed to ensure the panels and film would be cheap enough to be employed in developing countries near the tropics, where they’re needed most. In Stockton, the Grocery Outlet supermarket spent $40,000 on refrigeration per year between their freezer isles and the deli. SkyCool panels placed on the roof and is now saving about $5,800 in costs per year. that Raman and SkyCool Systems have gone in search of grant money to replace all the air conditioners in a school as part of a project to see if their special film can itself be the principle cooling agent of a building, while National Geographic adds that some scientists have created if only 1.5% of the world were covered in these panels, and that they could be maintained over a long enough period, it would reflect all the additional heat created by the climate crisis.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/professor-develops-technology-that-cools-people-down-without-electricity-or-ac/
"Although it may not number amongst the seven ancient wonders of the world, the 4,600-year-old solar boat belonging to Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu is an amazing marvel of the ancient world nonetheless. Last week, King Khufu’s reassembled solar craft was moved intact to its new permanent location, the Grand Egyptian Museum, where it’s sure to become a feature attraction among the museum’s reported 100,000 artifacts when the venue opens to the public later this year. Under the supervision of a team of engineers and archeologists, after being secured in a specially built, shock-absorbing container, the craft was ferried via a remote-controlled all-terrain vehicle for the five-mile, 10-hour journey from Giza to Cairo. King Khufu ruled Egypt during the Fourth Dynasty (circa 2613 to 2494 BCE). In 1954, Egyptian archaeologist Kamal el-Mallakh uncovered the remains of the cedar-wood barque buried outside Khufu’s royal tomb in the Pyramid of Cheops (a.k.a., the Great Pyramid), the largest of the three pyramids at Giza. The craft itself was no longer intact when el-Mallakh made the discovery, however, having rested for centuries in a tightly sealed chamber, the wood from which it was built remained in surprisingly good condition. Archaeologists toiled more than 20 months to painstakingly excavate the boat’s 1,224 component fragments. Using methods as historically accurate as possible to those by which the ship was originally built, it was almost another 10 years before a crew of researchers and restorers were able to piece the puzzle back together. Solar boats containing burial chambers were patterned after the mythical Barque of Ra, the Egyptian god revered as the embodiment of the Sun as it sailed the heavens from dawn to dusk each day. While historians are unclear whether this particular boat was part of Khufu’s working fleet or was built to facilitate the pharaoh’s ascension from the mortal to the immortal plain, it was common practice to outfit Pharaohs’ tombs with what the Egyptians believed to be the essentials of the afterlife—including transportation. As reported by , The aim of the recent transportation project was “to protect and preserve the biggest and oldest organic artifact made of wood in the history of humanity for future generations,” Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in a statement. And while that might not exactly be immortality, it’s still a pretty fine legacy indeed.

"In the latest audio survey of kiwi bird populations on New Zealand’s North Island, many areas that were silent in 2016 now have airways filled to bursting with kiwi calls. The male’s high shriek contrasts with the females low growl, but regardless of which sound it was—the early morning hours in December, when the last survey was made, were filled with stifled cries of joy from 150 volunteer bird conservationists. The manual population survey, called the Kiwi Call Count, uses the human ear to record population numbers of the nation’s five kiwi species to assess the status of the birds in a given area. The same sites are used every year, and 2021 saw a 50% increase in the number of sites in which calls were heard, while not one site had become silent over the last year. A complex kiwi-saving action plan to combat invasive species was implemented to protect the national bird . Stoats, dogs, feral cats, and other introduced mammals have flourished on the easily caught kiwi chicks, a species that evolved with no native mammalian predators. “To sit out there and hear how many kiwi there are and how close they are—it makes the effort put into trapping worthwhile,” Ayla Wiles, a biodiversity ranger for the Department of Conservation, told This trapping has been hugely successful, and —the northern brown and the rowi, waddled off the Endangered designation on the IUCN’s Red List. Wiles told reporters that some areas are seeing more of a sprint than a waddle. A place called Whangerei Heads has gone from having 80 kiwi to more than 1,000 since the program began. As a nocturnal bird, the call of the kiwi is the most reliable way to track the animals. The calls are easy to discern in the darkness, and even have unique characteristics that allow conservationists to recognize the same birds year after year. “You can be trapping, you know, week after week after week, in the hope that your kiwi are doing well,” said Ngaire Sullivan, an organizer . “And then for four nights a year, for just those eight hours… You sit there and get to hear your outcome.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/kiwi-numbers-grow-50-after-latest-audio-survye/
"In Kenya, a drive through the Central Highlands will sometimes reveal a landscape covered in a beautiful white-petaled flower with a lethal secret. The yellow center of the contains one of the world’s great natural insecticides, that as well as being totally harmless to plants, humans, and animals, supports the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of rural Kenyans who supply much of the world’s pyrethrum, the principle chemical in the flower. Pyrethrum is becoming a major tool in the fight against mosquito-borne illnesses, as the toxin attacks the central nervous system of the insect, causing it to spasm around and drop still over a 30-second period. It’s also an excellent , not only for gardens and crops but livestock, who can from biting ticks and flies if a little pyrethrum is rubbed onto their neck, legs, and shoulders. Simply growing near any plants you wish to keep insect free is enough to protect them from most pests, such is the power of the pyrethrum therein. “Pyrethrin is the most important insecticide in the world,” says Joel Maina Kibett, chief agriculture officer of Nakuru County in Kenya. “It is natural, organic, and it has no environmental effects. And it is user friendly.” As chemical insecticides are responsible for around the world, declines in honeybees, and many other deleterious effects on animals, the need for mass-produced natural chemicals is high. Kenya is uniquely suited for the cultivation of the flower and the pyrethrum it produces, as its Central Highlands region provides perfect growing conditions for the flower which bursts out of the ground following Kenya’s two rainy seasons. During the 1970s and ’80s, Kenya grew nearly all the pyrethrum in the world decades after the arrival of the chrysanthemum species from Japan along with British colonizers. It became such an economic driver that it was placed in the Kenyan coat of arms following independence. After the rise of industrial agriculture and cheaper pyrethrum produced elsewhere, the entire pyrethrum farming industry in Kenya collapsed. The pyrethrum state monopoly only finished paying off debts to growers in 2018, a year after Kenya liberalized the market, encouraging competition, production, and innovation. In Kibett’s Nakuru County, 2017 saw 15,703 farming households receive seedlings from the county government and half a dozen private companies. National Geographic reports that these are already generating income for more than 100,000 rural Kenyans. “In total, we have given out 23.3 million seedlings since we started the revival of the sector,” Kibett in a special feature on pyrethrum. “Most of us became what we are because of that flower. We remember seeing beautiful landscapes covered with white sheets of flowers. We have done it before, and the results were very good. And we have the knowledge. We have the existing infrastructure.” Where before farmers sometimes had to wait months to receive payments for their deliveries, the private sector are settling up within a few days on a popular mobile payment app which in turn allows farmers to quickly pay for school and other things. Much of the pyrethrum goes to making mosquito-killing incense: coils of pyrethrum produced from dried that are popular insect repellents around the world. A University of Nairobi that pyrethrin-based insect spray managed to kill around 96% of a recent desert locust plague, a devastating phenomenon that creates unstoppable swarms of flying insects that can devour 300 million pounds of crops in a single day. Since much of the world’s pyrethrum is grown in the Horn of Africa, where locusts are such a problem, it seems like the perfect solution.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/kenya-chrysanthemum-pyrethrum-flower-industry-offers-rural-income-and-natural-insecticide/
"“It’s hard not to be romantic about baseball,” said Brad Pitt’s character in the film —and this story unfolding last week on an Iowa farm is a great example. For those lucky enough to have watched Kevin Costner’s enduring classic as a young boy or girl signed up for little league, the sight of Costner and the real-life Yankees and White Sox walking through the corn stalks onto a regulation size baseball diamond to play an actual Major League Baseball game is, well, ‘perfect.’ The first-place Chicago White Sox faced the New York Yankees adjacent to the corn field in Dyersville, where the iconic film was shot—and it was the first MLB league game Appearing from a stretch of mature corn beyond the warning track in right field, Costner— who has a great baseball arm and threw his own pitches in movies like and led the two teams onto the field in the video below, to rousing applause before throwing the first pitch at the game. “Build it and they will come,” goes the famous line in the film, and indeed thousands of MLB fans from around the country showed up to watch on this perfect occasion. Randy Peterson, writing for the recapped the thoughts of Yankees manager Aaron Boone after their team lost, 9-8. “That’s probably the greatest setting for a baseball game that I’ve ever been a part of.” One of the fans commented, “I was in attendance and it was by far the best sporting event I ever attended. MLB hit a home run on this!” “(The) coolest part was, in order to get to the game you had to enter through the corn in center field on the original field” “Everything was just so well planned out.” James Earle Jones starred in the movie as author Terrance Mann, and, now 90-years-old, he honored the project by contributing his famous deep voice to read the Fox pre-game teaser. Sports Illustrated detailed how refreshing it was to watch a ballgame without the endless inter-inning pageantry, advertisements on the jumbotron, constant requests to “make some noise,” and blaring music. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said the game will be back next year, likely featuring the Reds and the Cubs, cementing another special date in the MLB calendar, alongside the All-Star Game, Homerun Derby, and Post Season. “It does feel like all the teams are going to want to touch this,” Costner told . “There’s going to be hot competition to play here. There’s going to be records set here as a result of . I hope it does happen.” Maybe a record wasn’t set this time, but a riveting final inning delighted the crowd. By , Chicago was leading 7-4, after several home runs had sailed into the cornfields surrounding the park (pictured below, next to the smaller film site). In a nightmare for the otherwise-stellar pitcher Liam Hendricks, he allowed New York to wipe out that 3-run lead after a single by Tyler Wade led to a home run by Aaron Judge—Judge’s second of the game. With just three outs left in the game, the Sox were only down by one run. Seby Zavala made it to first base, and then Tim Anderson proceeded to hit a walk-off homer over the corn stalks where the teams had entered three hours earlier, sealing the win, 9-8.

"There’s a lot of talk about rewilding in Europe, where so much wild country has been eliminated over the last 1,000 years, but it usually comes from radical farmers, not death metal musician-filmmakers. That’s exactly who Randal Plunkett is: a living, working testament to the power of humanity to create change for a better future. In the face of his lifestyle (as a steak-eating body-building, death metalhead) and under the weight of his heritage (as the 21st Baron of Dunsany Castle in Ireland’s County Meath) Randal decided to take action to restore the dwindling number of truly wild spaces on the Emerald Isle by converting his entire 650-hectare (1,600-acre) estate into Ireland’s most ambitious rewilding project. First installed in Dunsany Castle in 1402, the Plunkett family is one of Ireland’s oldest clans of blue-bloods. A Plunkett was canonized after being executed by the Church of England in the 17th century, and another ancestor, Horace Plunkett, advocated on behalf of rural development and farming innovations during the early 20th century. “I’ve never been a country bumpkin,” Randall told “I saw it as a burden, a life of servitude.” Now though, concerns about the climate crisis and his country’s native ecosystem destruction has led him to turn his estate over to nature, letting grasses grow tall, and animals to run wild—a clean break from his ancestor Horace’s ideas of agriculture. “The reserve is pretty much left untouched, with natural processes left to reshape the landscape,” Randall, officially ‘Lord Dunsany,’ told the , which he recently joined. “There’s no drainage, and areas of grassland are left to be grazed by wild animals, such as deer.” “Otters have returned—the first time the species has been seen on the estate in my lifetime. We have pine martens, stoats, hedgehogs, foxes, badgers and barn owls. Red kite and snipe have returned. We have seen a big increase in insects—with a massive surge in butterflies—and we now see many different bat species. Even endangered Irish species such as corncrakes have come back. Nature really is flourishing,” he added. With several small streams meandering through what is mostly unforested land, there’s room for natural processes to stretch out and create that marvelous chaos most ecosystems need to make substantial, resilient food webs and habitat. Lord Dunsany doesn’t have much interest in opening the estate up to much more than small tour groups, but as a filmmaker, he does allow filming crews on to shoot, most recently for his own independent film , named for that most stunning shade of green that covers so much of Ireland, not least of which, his family estate. Private estates like those owned by historically royal families are often some of Europe’s best places to experiment with rewilding. places like Bunloit and Glenfeshie Estates in Scotland, and Ken Hill and Knepp Estates elsewhere, are often the only ones which have the large tracks of countryside that aren’t already deeply agricultural necessary to give rewilding a shot. As GNN reported last year, —a broke descendant of lords who couldn’t farm his land anymore turned it into an English wildland safari, creating one of England’s most biodiverse areas and wiping out his debts at the same time.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/randall-plunkett-turns-dunsany-castle-county-meath-into-rewilding-project-in-ireland/
"There’s plenty a humorous tale to prove the adage “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure,” but when one Ohio family accidentally threw their grandma’s treasure into the trash, it was no laughing matter. Unbeknownst to her relatives, the canny granny had stashed $25,000 in cold hard cash in her freezer. While tidying up the kitchen, her erstwhile kinfolk accidentally tossed out the tidy sum along with the outdated frozen veggies. It was only after the fact that the elderly woman remembered to warn her family not to misplace the envelope with the money in it, but by then, it was too late. The garbage had already been collected and her nest egg was on its way to the city landfill. Frantic, the family reached out to Republic Solid Waste Services to see if there was any way their grandma’s missing savings could be retrieved. It would all depend, they learned, on whether or not the truck had already arrived at the landfill. Had the truck offloaded at the dumpsite, it would have been a lost cause. “The bulldozers… immediately start smoothing it out, pushing it into the hill, dropping dirt on it and start covering up the process of the landfill,” Republic operations supervisor Gary Capan told Cleveland’s . “…We do that in a nonstop process [so] if it got dropped there, there’s no finding it anymore.” Luckily, Capan was able to track down the driver who had yet to make the drop-off. The truck was diverted to a nearby recycling center where its six-ton cargo of garbage was disgorged on the tarmac, and a crew of 10 stalwart workers immediately began sifting through the mountain of refuse in search of the buried booty. And find it they did—in record time. “[I] couldn’t believe it took 10 minutes and actually, I said, ‘Man, it looks just like that,’ pulled it off, opened it up and there was the package inside with the money. They (the family) were so happy, they were tearing up,” Dan Schoewe, operations manager at the recycling center told News-5. “It’s rare that we can find something for somebody, so this is like the biggest one I’ve seen in 30 years.” While we’re glad this story has a happy ending, a word of warning to the well-meaning de-clutters of the world: elderly people of squirreling money and other valuables away in the oddest places, so if helping clear out a loved one’s residence is on your to-do list, be sure to proceed with caution.

"A real-life Soprano went from New Jersey gang member to musical star after videos of him singing to patients at the hospital where he worked went viral. 28-year-old Enrique Rodriquez from Central Jersey, now works as a phlebotomist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and is widely renowned for his musical talent. He began posting videos on his TikTok account, which now boasts over 80,000 followers, of him singing and playing the piano for critically ill patients in the hospital’s Intensive Care Unit. He left behind a history of violence and crime to help people who are suffering after turning to religion. He said of his turnaround: “I found God at an extremely troubling period in my life and he showed himself to me when I needed him most. I know that God wanted me to care for people just as he cared for me, and the hospital was the perfect place to do that.” It was 2009 when Rodriguez first got involved with gangs after his eldest brother went to prison. The loss of his brother to the jail system meant that Rodriquez felt disconnected from his loved ones, and he went out searching for what he called “the wrong kind of family.” He became a ‘blood member’ of a local gang for three years after being misled by the idea of joining a strong brotherhood and making quick and easy money. He explained: “The gang lifestyle is pure manipulation. They make you feel like they care about you, that they’ve got your back that you’re family; but all they do is use you so they don’t have to get their hands dirty.” The turning point for Rodriguez came when he hurt the “wrong person” and a rival gang came after his mother. There were two attempts made on his mother’s life before the aggressors were arrested, and Rodriguez believes it is down to God that his mother is still alive today. He added: “I have done a lot of bad things and mixed with a lot of bad people. “I’m just grateful God looked out for me and my family. He has given me the opportunity to start a new life, and music is a huge part of that.” Rodriguez began working in the hospital in 2012 as a housekeeper in order to get a job there as quickly as possible. A year later, he completed training to become a patient carer in the ICU, and now works as a phlebotomist ferrying COVID-19 and blood samples from different laboratories. He has worked at the hospital for nine years now, and during his career, he discovered that he possessed a raw musical talent. Unable to read sheet music, Rodriguez taught himself to play both the piano and the guitar, and practiced by playing in front of several patients on the ward. Sadly, Barbara Freud, a cancer patient who was one of Rodriguez’s first listeners, passed away whilst he was on holiday, but he will always remember the musical bond they shared. He now makes regular visits to patients’ bedsides and uses TikTok to live stream his performances to tens of thousands of viewers. Rodriquez plans to grow his following by making more videos and spreading love and happiness through his music. He said: “I love what I do and I believe my purpose in this world is to help other people. “When I’m singing to these patients I can feel the connection we have and it’s wonderful. “There was a time where I was singing to a patient in a coma and he woke up for the first time in weeks. “It was a true miracle.” Next week, Rodriguez will travel to Puerto Rico with his church group to give aid to disadvantaged children, and there’s no doubt his guitar will be making the trip too.

"An international research team has retraced the astonishing lifetime journey of an Arctic woolly mammoth, which covered enough of the Alaska landscape during its 28 years to almost circle the Earth twice. Scientists gathered unprecedented details of its life through analysis of a 17,000-year-old fossil from the University of Alaska Museum of the North. By generating and studying isotopic data in the mammoth’s tusk, they were able to match its movements and diet with isotopic maps of the region. Few details have been known about the lives and movements of woolly mammoths, and the study offers the first evidence that they traveled vast distances. An outline of the mammoth’s life is detailed in the new issue of the journal Science. “It’s not clear-cut if it was a seasonal migrator, but it covered some serious ground,” said University of Alaska Fairbanks researcher Matthew Wooller, senior and co-lead author of the paper. “It visited many parts of Alaska at some point during its lifetime, which is pretty amazing when you think about how big that area is.” Researchers at the Alaska Stable Isotope Facility, where Wooller is director, split the 6-foot tusk lengthwise and generated about 400,000 microscopic data points using a laser and other techniques. The detailed isotope analyses they made are possible because of the way that mammoth tusks grew. Mammoths steadily added new layers on a daily basis throughout their lives. When the tusk was split lengthwise for sampling, these growth bands looked like stacked ice cream cones, offering a chronological record of an entire mammoth’s life. “From the moment they’re born until the day they die, they’ve got a diary and it’s written in their tusks,” said Pat Druckenmiller, a paleontologist and director of the UA Museum of the North, . “Mother Nature doesn’t usually offer up such convenient and lifelong records of an individual’s life.” Scientists knew that the mammoth died on Alaska’s North Slope above the Arctic Circle, where its remains were excavated by a team that included UAF’s Dan Mann and Pam Groves, who are among the co-authors of the study. Researchers pieced together the mammoth’s journey up to that point by analyzing isotopic signatures in its tusk from the elements strontium and oxygen, which were matched with maps predicting isotope variations across Alaska. Researchers created the maps by analyzing the teeth of hundreds of small rodents from across Alaska held in the museum’s collections. The animals travel relatively small distances during their lifetimes and represent local isotope signals. Using that local dataset, they mapped isotope variation across Alaska, providing a baseline to trace the mammoth movements. After taking geographic barriers into account and the average distance it traveled each week, researchers used a novel spatial modeling approach to chart the likely routes the animal took during its life. Ancient DNA preserved in the mammoth’s remains allowed the team to identify it as a male that was related to the last group of its species living in mainland Alaska. Those details provided more insight into the animal’s life and behavior, said Beth Shapiro, who led the DNA component of the study. For example, an abrupt shift in its isotopic signature, ecology and movement at about age 15 probably coincided with the mammoth being kicked out of its herd, mirroring a pattern seen in some modern-day male elephants. “Knowing that he was male provided a better biological context in which we could interpret the isotopic data,” said Shapiro, a professor at the University of California Santa Cruz and investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Isotopes also offered a clue about what led to the animal’s demise. Nitrogen isotopes spiked during the final winter of its life, a signal that can be a hallmark of starvation in mammals. “It’s just amazing what we were able to see and do with this data,” said co-lead author Clement Bataille, a researcher from the University of Ottawa who led the modeling effort in collaboration with Amy Willis at the University of Washington. Discovering more about the lives of extinct species satisfies more than curiosity, said Wooller, a professor in the UAF Institute of Northern Engineering and College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences. Those details could be surprisingly relevant today as many species adapt their movement patterns and ranges with the shifting climate. “The Arctic is seeing a lot of changes now, and we can use the past to see how the future may play out for species today and in the future,” Wooller said. “Trying to solve this detective story is an example of how our planet and ecosystems react in the face of environmental change.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/travels-of-mammoth-17000-years-ago-revealed-tusks-alaska/
"A smooth pebble, fired in a kiln from the ashes of a dearly departed, is the latest way Americans can choose to carry on the memory of a loved one. is a startup looking to give people both a personal and portable way to remember someone they’ve lost, with one person’s ashes capable of producing a collection of stones. As has reported before, Americans as a whole don’t have the best relationship with death. While the cost of traditional casket burial funerals is reaching unsustainable levels, a sea of new companies are rushing in to help people find better, cheaper solutions. Some have leaned towards the green funeral movement, with , or forest conservation at the base of a tree. Others have moved into personalized ash-crafting, such , , or even an artificial diamond. Parting Stone is a mixture of the two, sparing soils from the near-ammonia levels of pH found in human ashes, while also allowing people to quite discretely carry a small memory of the departed with them. “It’s a canvas for the experience, not the experience itself,” explains founder Justin Crowe to The ashes are milled into a really fine powder and mixed with water to create a clay-like base. This is placed into a kiln and fired into the stone which is then polished. Without knowing exactly why, the stones tend to vary in color, which Crowe hypothesizes could be due to physiological differences between the deceased, such as diet composition or medications. Regardless, they can appear white, brown, faintly blueish-grey or green, lavender, or with a variety of speckled patterns. Weighing between 4-8 pounds, a family will typically get anywhere from 40-60 stones at the cost of $675 for a human and $300 for a pet. Crowe explains that he came up with the idea after losing his grandfather in 2014, and wanted a better experience with his remains, which felt void of spirit, even in a decorative urn. Of course, as Crowe points out, ashes usually come in a plastic bag before an urn is chosen. “We don’t accept this experience in any other part of modern life. Why are we accepting it for people we love?” he said. He remembers how people felt around the stones at a business conference, when more than 200 people asked to hold them. Collecting small, beautiful or fascinating stones is something many of us do, especially in natural places like a waterfall or in a desert wash where interesting geological processes occur. Holding a smooth stone that fits nicely in one’s palm, knowing it contains a piece of something you love, speaks to that very primal desire.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/parting-stone-turns-ashes-into-a-collection-of-small-memorial-stones/
"While youth is often a time of great promise and achievement, a life well lived can also be filled with any number of next chapters and second—or even third—acts that add depth, nuance, and meaning to our stories. At 65 years old, Somerset native Carole-Ann Warburton experienced a plot twist that led to the fulfillment of a long-cherished dream she’d never even spoken of aloud. After a debilitating illness incapacitated her, Warburton was left with the question of what to do going forward. During her convalescence, her daughter brought around some real estate listings for the sort of homes in which she thought her mum might best spend her golden years. Coincidentally, amongst the notices was an offering for a small barbershop with an above-stairs apartment. For Warburton, although she admits “the place was awful,” it was love at first sight—and the perfect opportunity to do something she’d yearned to do for almost as long as she could remember—work in a bookshop. Less than three months after coming to her decision, Warburton had handed in her retirement notice, sold her house, bought the store, and—using a personal inventory totaling between 8,000 to 9,000 titles—she launched her new venture, . Warburton has been an avid book collector since she was a child. As an adult, she married a man with a similar avocation. The four-bedroom home she and her ex-husband shared with their children (much to their dismay) was “chock-a-block” with books. Warburton admits learning to let go of her beloved tomes was a bit of an adjustment, but one she feels the better for making. “It still feels, when a special book goes out, like a bit of a loss—as if some little part of me has been taken away,” she said in an interview with . “And then I make common sense come back to me and say, ‘Let someone else learn from it.’ It’s a growing up, if you like, an acceptance.” A decade on, The Book Rest recently celebrated its 10th anniversary. Although the pandemic has slowed foot traffic, since Warburton’s driving motive isn’t monetary profit, but rather, something of a deeper, more idiosyncratic personal value, she has no plans to close up shop. Having achieved her own dream, Warburton sees every day in the bookstore as an opportunity to help others realize theirs as well. “All the dreams are in the books,” she told The Guardian. “They are all there waiting to be picked up… Someone can walk in tomorrow and say, ‘I have been looking for that for an awfully long time!” And as gatekeeper to her own small universe of literary wonders, Warburton says she plans to stay around as long as she can to ensure that they do.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/carole-ann-warburton-bookstore-open/
"Black cats may have the reputation for being bad luck, but don’t tell that to the owner of one ebony feline who helped save her life. Piran the kitty lives with his cat mom in a rural area of Cornwall, England. When the 83-year-old Bodmin woman went missing, neighbors launched a search party, scouring the nearby countryside, but she was nowhere to be found—until searchers caught sight of an agitated Piran, mewing loudly by a cornfield gate. “The cat is very attached to her, and he was going back and forth in the gateway and meowing, so I decided to go and search the maize field,” searcher Tamar Longmuir told . With the crop standing seven feet tall, the going was difficult. Keeping to the perimeter, Longmuir skirted the field, calling out her neighbor’s name. She’d reached the bottom of the field when she finally heard a faint response. To Longmuir’s dismay, she realized the elderly woman had taken a tumble down a steep, 70-foot ravine, and after passing through some barbed wire, had finally come to rest in a stream. Although Longmuir was able to make her way down to assess the situation, and thankfully, learned her neighbor lady had sustained no major injuries, it’s believed the octogenarian had been stuck there for several hours. This afternoon Officers from Bodmin were tasked to conduct a search for a missing 83 year old female. The female was located by a member of the public who had spotted the female’s cat, meowing in the corner of a large maize field near to her home address. 1/3 Longmuir had to climb back up the ravine to get cell phone service, but she was able to contact emergency crews who soon arrived to extricate the stranded senior from the ravine. After a concerted two-hour effort by almost 25 emergency personnel from the police, fire department, and air and water rescue services, the woman was airlifted to a nearby hospital for treatment. “Whilst the lady concerned is still currently receiving care, she is in good spirits and is being well looked after,” Bodmin Police said in a . “Piran the cat saved the day!” Indeed, had Piran not sounded the alarm, the outcome might have been vastly different. “Without the cat waiting at the gate to that field, it could have been hours later that I or anyone else would have checked in there,” Longmuir told Sky News. Grateful for Piran’s persistent vocal intervention in aid of his human, neighbors are pitching in to take care of her kitty while she recuperates. In America, August 17th marks National Black Cat Appreciation Day, but considering Piran’s recent heroic deeds, we think an international show of appreciation for a tale that begins and ends with the cat’s meow would be just about “ fect.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cats-meows-lead-searcher-to-83-year-old-owner-who-fell-into-ravine/

"Big tropical mining companies could soon be presented with a green alternative to traditional strip mining by letting plants hoover up the trace minerals instead of mining equipment. Phytomining, as it’s called, relies on a select few species of plants that can literally suck the soil dry of minerals like zinc, selenium, nickel, and cobalt. Rather than polluted rivers, plumes of sulfur dioxide, and the throng of heavy machinery, phytominin—as one demo site which started in 2015 bears witness—relies on locals to trim a few feet of a 20-feet tall green shrub. These leavings are collected and burned to create “bio-ore” filled with 20 to 25% nickel by weight. The mining industry is keen to see how this green alternative to one of the most carbon-heavy industries can actually perform. Allowing plants to gather materials for you beats rooting around for it in the ground on a remote island like Borneo. “We can now demonstrate that metal farms can produce between 150 to 250 kilograms of nickel per hectare (170 to 280 pounds per acre), annually,” Antony van der Ent, a senior research fellow at Australia’s University of Queensland, told in a special report on phytomining in Indonesia. “At this stage, phytomining can go full-scale for nickel immediately, while phytomining for cobalt, thallium, and selenium is within reach,” van der Ent said. Nickel mining companies might be drooling over the van der Ent and other “metal farmer” experts have done that found nickel phytomining to be on a similar cost basis to corn farming, but with an after-production gross of around $1,800 per hectare—making it a very profitable activity. While the report details phytomining in Borneo, trials in the U.S.A, Italy, Albania, Canada, France, Spain, and New Zealand. There are around 700 recognized “hyperaccumulators,” which is the term for plant species that can absorb large quantities of these minerals before depositing them in their shoots, branches, and leaves. There are some parallels to food agriculture, for example the amendment of calcium is vital, while nitrogen and organic material supplementation seem to increase the available nickel in plant shoots. By far the most advantageous aspect of phytomining if you run a major mining corporation is actually not where the soil is rich, but where the soil is poor, in nickel. At concentrations of 1% or less, the only option is to strip mine, for example in locations like Brazil, Cuba, Indonesia, the Philippines, and New Caledonia. It involves taking a surface layer of rock and soil off a stretch of ground, and using acid-leaching heavy machinery to extract the scarce nickel particles. All this unhappy work for very little metal results in a layer of toxic topsoil filled with trailing metal particles that has to be collected and sold to landfills at great cost to the miners. With production in the Indonesian site slowed due to COVID, van der Ent is using this time to develop a hydro-metallurgical extraction method so as to avoid burning the plant trimmings for nickel, thus eliminating the CO2 generated. That’s exciting news indeed.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/phytomining-is-like-metal-farming-nickel-zinc-and-cobalt-using-plants/
"When Paolo Fanciulli dropped 39 large marble sculptures down to the bottom of the sea off Tuscany’s Maremma Regional Park, it was not his first strike in the battle against unsustainable fishing, but it was his first step into the art world. This fascinating story, at the heart of which is a fascinating and charismatic figure, recounts the confluence of an ancient relationship between man and nature and a celebration of the Mediterranean Sea as a cradle of civilization. 60-year-old Fanciulli practices sustainable fishing and “ ” or fishing-tourism at his home in the village of Talamone. He still wakes up at dawn before heading out into the clear waters off the coast of Tuscany’s Grosseto province. He and his colleague Francesco fish, as their ancient ancestors did, by casting shallow nets that take mullet and bream while leaving the bottom reaches undisturbed. Fanciulli’s “war” against illegal or unsustainable methods of fishing is long documented, and has appeared in newspapers around the globe. From 2002 to 2006, he gathered the help of the Tuscan government and WWF-Italia to deploy a strategic formation of 126 underwater cement bollards to ruin any of the deep sea trawling nets which he realized were rapidly destroying the fish stocks he grew up harvesting. The nets would tear up the delicate seabed ecosystem, including seagrass meadows, and simply decapitate the marine food-web. But Fanciulli knew the nets were extremely expensive to replace, and the relatively-inexpensive bollards, costing about €560 to make and transport, would last a lot longer than the poachers would. That work took him twenty years to complete, recount the authors of his biography His next project would be similar, but quite different. It would expand the protection of his beloved Mediterranean, while enlisting some of the greatest marble sculptors on Earth to bring the world’s attention to the greater problem of general environmental degradation. “The importance of the project is that we need some sensible consumption of resources,” Fanciulli told GNN However the illegal industry is devastating everything, and with this project we can send a message to the whole world to give back; not only to take.” “But the intent of mine is also to think of the future; a better future, with more sustainable fishing, and a greater respect for the environment.” Paolo Fanciulli is, as he told me when I went out on a tour with him and Francesco, a fisherman, not a super-savvy marketer or social media manager. So with the help of a childhood friend who had become a successful engineer, Fanciulli imagined a series of large marble sculptures, taken from the Carrara Quarry, the fount of so much of the marble which Michelangelo used to create his artworks. Even while Fanciulli asked for merely two, after meeting with the President of Grosseto region and Ippolito Turco, the president of an association that now looks after the sculptures—he received 100. But who would sculpt them? He needed to find generous and far-sighted sculptors who would put their creativity at the service of the sea, and enough funding to transport the 10-20 ton blocks from the north of Tuscany to the south. Arriving at the house of an artist named Massimo Catalani, who lived in Rome and worked at the famous Federici Palace, Paolo, who brought his morning’s catch in a large pot to cook for dinner, was connected with scores of people from the world of art and architecture, one of whom was Emily Young, considered Britain’s best living sculptor. “It was like a film,” Paolo writes. Young was among a dozen international and Italian sculptors who donated their time and effort to that would not be seen in traditional museums, but that would slowly become covered in seaweed, and seen only by divers as they sit sentinel-like, defending the life of the depths. In May 2015, the first 20 stone blocks, each costing thousands simply to transport to the pier of Talamone, were loaded onto a barge and floated out to their final resting place. A second group of 19 were lowered down last summer. Ippolito Turco told “We’ve managed to totally stop the illegal fishing in the area. Now we’re looking at extending the project along the coast to the north. We want to put more sculptures on the seafloor. It has proved to be very effective.” “What you want to happen is that in time, you won’t know they are sculptures,” said Ms. Young. “They will be so covered in seaweed and algae that they will look like a coral reef or the remains of a wreck.” Young added that she likes to hope they will be found by marine archaeologists one day, and hypothesized as being part of an ancient civilization. 61 blocks of greyish marble remain in Turco and Fanciulli’s possession, waiting for world-renowned sculptors to carve them into statues. For those familiar with the 17 or guilds of Siena, one sculptor plans to make one of every animal-symbol on the guilds’ coats of arms, something bound to attract major investment from the uber-patriotic city, while Paolo also wants to work with the Grosseto Cultural Office to install underwater lighting amid the sculptures to light them up for a few hours at night time. “If there are artists that want to come to the House of the Fish, we are available, because the more artists we have the stronger the project,” Fanciulli told GNN “I think if famous artists come here, there’s a bigger impact. If there are artists reading this, our sea has need of your talents.” The is one big fundraiser, where people can contribute in all sorts of ways to the project. Artists looking to carve a block will post their idea as a fundraiser, and anyone who contributes gets gifts in return, such as dinner and a fishing trip with Paolo, paintings, and more.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/paolo-fanciullis-la-casa-dei-pesci-is-an-underwater-sculpture-garden-that-stops-trawling/
"Locally extinct bandicoots have returned to an Australian national park in New South Wales after more than 100 years. The nationally threatened species—known by local Aboriginal people as ‘talpero’—once ranged across inland Australia, including the area now managed as Sturt National Park. The small, native marsupials became extinct in the region after ecosystem changes caused by rabbits and predation by feral cats and foxes. Now, a founding population of talpero have been reintroduced to the area by the team at Wild Deserts. Their reintroduction is another major milestone in the Wild Deserts conservation project, which last year reintroduced bilbies and mulgaras into the national park. “The season has been tremendous out here with the rains we had last year and then again in March,” says UNSW’s Dr Rebecca West, an ecologist based at Wild Deserts. “These rains have helped create a highly productive system that is excellent for the reintroduction of this species.” Up until recently, western barred bandicoots were considered one species with five subspecies, but this has recently split into five species. Only the Shark Bay species, the species translocated to Sturt National Park, survived. UNSW scientists acknowledge this important taxonomic work. This remaining species has been moved to two islands and three fenced locations. The Wild Deserts conservation reintroduction came from one of these, a self-sustaining population at Arid Recovery near Roxby Downs. Supported by governments because of their conservation value, the Wild Deserts conservation reintroduction recognizes the important role that this species complex played in ecological function, important for restoring desert ecosystems. The Wild Deserts team eradicated every last rabbit, cat, and fox from two 2,000 hectare feral-proof fenced exclosures within Sturt National Park, creating one of the largest feral-animal-free areas in Australia. These exclosures in the wild work as ‘training zones’, where reintroduced vulnerable species can learn to live in the wild without dangers from predators like cats and foxes. When their populations start thriving, the animals will be released into a second training area with predators, where they will learn to become predator-smart. The ultimate project aim is to release a smarter generation of bandicoots and other locally extinct mammals back into the wild. NSW Environment Minister Matt Kean says: “The reintroduction of this important species to the Corner Country in Sturt National Park is another huge step in our battle to halt and reverse the tide of mammal extinctions. “Our aim is to re-establish ecosystems as they were before feral cats, foxes and rabbits wreaked havoc on Australian native wildlife.” Talpero are the smallest members of the bandicoot family, roughly the size of a guinea pig. They can be distinguished from other bandicoots by their fawn-coloured coat with pale stripes across their rump. The nocturnal marsupials dig for their food in sandy environments, making foraging pits to find seeds, tubers, insects, and fungi. This process turns the soil and helps it catch water and nutrients, contributing to the overall health of the ecosystem. The Wild Deserts team have introduced 10 talpero as a founding population, but they hope to add more members soon. “If they keep doing as well as they are, then I think we will be able to add some more characters to the mix,” says Dr West. “Hopefully that will re-establish bandicoots back into Sturt National Park into the future.” The founding talpero population are from Arid Recovery, an independent not-for-profit conservation and research project that manages a large feral-free safe haven near Roxby Downs in South Australia. The marsupials were released into Wild Deserts’ southern exclosure, called ‘Mingku’—named after the word meaning happy in the Maljangapa language. The talpero joined two other recently reintroduced species, the bilbies and mulgaras. “This is an important step in restoring this desert ecosystem,” says Professor Richard Kingsford, leader of the Wild Deserts project and director of the UNSW Centre for Ecosystem Science. “We are already starting to see the beginnings of a transformation occurring in the landscape. The soil is starting to turn over, which gives great opportunities for lots of little invertebrates and catches water and nutrients. “We think that’s part of how we can transform these deserts back into what they were.” Dr John Read from Ecological Horizons, a major partner of the Wild Deserts project, says “These energetic little diggers at Wild Deserts are important culturally, historically and ecologically and will be great for restoring the desert.” The Wild Deserts scientists will check in on the animals daily using radio tracking devices to ensure they’re adapting well to their new environment. “We have deliberately designed the Wild Deserts project to allow us opportunities for scientific monitoring to assess our management and the success of the species,” says UNSW’s Dr Reece Pedler, the Wild Deserts project coordinator, . “We hope to establish talpero in other parts of the Wild Deserts site—and ultimately into neighbouring areas of Sturt National Park or beyond. We have already recorded recruitment of young that were translocated in pouch and other young that were born at Wild Deserts.” Wild Deserts is part of a major NSW Government initiative to protect threatened native mammals via the Reintroduction of Locally Extinct Mammals project and the Saving our Species initiative. Next, the team plan to reintroduce other threatened mammals into the Wild Deserts exclosures, including western quolls, stick-nest rats, and golden bandicoots.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bandicoots-return-to-sturt-national-park-after-century/

"A Michigan woman accidentally lost her wedding rings on the sandy shores of Lake Superior—but soon celebrated the return of the precious jewels after some stunning police work by the local sheriff’s K-9 dog. Elsa Green had taken her rings off at Eagle Beach to apply some sunscreen, setting them carefully in her hat. Later, she was suddenly startled by a large bug crawling on the cap and she tossed it into the air—remembering only seconds later that her precious rings were inside. When a frantic search for the wedding band and matching engagement ring turned up nothing, Green and her friends enlisted the aid of someone using a metal detector who was scanning the sand—but he couldn’t find them, either. “I felt sick about it,” the Washington Post. “I’d been wearing those rings every day for 17 years. But at that moment, I figured they were gone.” Hoping the police might have another metal detector that would allow them to continue the search, Green’s pal drove to the Keweenaw County Sheriff’s Office. While the department didn’t have a metal detector, they did have a ‘Dogo’— a specially trained 5-year-old Dutch shepherd with a nose for ferreting out weapons. Dogo can also find things by honing in on a person’s signature odor. According to Dogo’s, handler Sgt. Brad Pelli, K-9s trained in “article search” can detect pretty much anything that still has a human scent trail on it. But, looking for a lost wedding ring would be a ‘first’. Arriving at the beach, Pelli cleared the area of people, so Dogo would have the best shot at locking onto the olfactory clue he was searching for, without distraction. It didn’t take him long. The intrepid pooch latched onto the scent of Green’s engagement ring, and dutifully sat down on the spot. Pelli sifted some sand through his hand and found its hiding place—and then found the second ring close by. With the rings back on her finger where they belonged, Green and her 9-year-old son gave Dogo a huge hug and heaped praise on Sgt. Pelli for volunteering his services without any payment. An ecstatic Green posted , celebrating the amazing find: “K9 Dogo, you will forever be my hero!” she enthused. “Dogo put his training and skills to use and sure enough he found my rings! I’ll be bringing you ice cream to say thank you!” All Dogo requires for a job well done is some praise and a chance to play with his favorite ball—but after the mini-miracle at the beach, a little treat might be a pawsome reward. Green’s friend Karen Saunders Kezele commented, “Amazing job!! We’re so fortunate to have that team here in the Keweenaw!”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/police-dog-finds-lost-diamond-ring-on-beach-elsa-green/
"One of the most beautiful of its species, the garter snake that inhabits the San Francisco peninsula is also the most endangered of its kind. Fortunately for the California serpent, it has human protectors who have given it a safe haven near the runways of the San Francisco International Airport. The San Francisco garter snake ( ), which can grow to three-feet in length, has skin that looks like a black canvas painted with racing stripes of bright orange and neon turquoise. As the Bay Area has grown and developed, the wetland habitat that is needed to sustain the harmless snake has diminished, so the animal was listed as endangered 54 years ago. Brutal droughts have also thinned its population, and that of their prey, as well. While the snake is mostly isolated around the San Francisco peninsula, they are thriving in numbers near the tarmac of the airport known as SFO. A tract of 160 privately-owned acres has been put to work to save the beautiful reptile, including the construction of many small ponds where the snake can keep moist, breed, and hunt for its favorite prey: the red-legged frog—which is also endangered and given sanctuary on the SFO runway lawn. : The officials who own the land and operate the airport now boast that they’ve kept 1,300 snakes happy and fed while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) looks for a better solution. In fact, the recent survey by the FWS declared this to be the largest population of this particular garter snake anywhere—something the SFO brass found to be a “pleasant surprise.” “Everything that happens there is designed to protect these species,” said SFO spokesperson Doug Yakel, . “For us, success would be that there is a stable thriving population, but to find out we had the largest population—it was really a pleasant surprise.” : In the rest of the Bay Area, cats and dogs have become two of the snake’s top predators. But, at the airport the snakes pretty much have the land to themselves—a double-positive as the airport wildlife biologist can make sure that they are insulated from the effects of climate change that would normally damage wild populations. The frogs too, have ponds they can safely raise their tadpoles in. “As our airport continues to evolve, this is the one place that continues to stay the same,” Yakel said. “We want to continue to provide a good stable environment for these two endangered species. Hearing that they are thriving—that is the ultimate validation.” : In the 1985 laid out alongside the endangered listing, the FWS wrote that 10 populations of at least 200 snakes must be stable or growing for 15 consecutive years before the snake can be considered for delisting. By this criteria, at least one habitat, SFO, has come through with spades.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/endangered-san-francisco-garter-snake-at-sfo-airport/

"A five-minute breathing exercise that you can do while watching television can lower your blood pressure as much as medication, according to a new small study. Described as “strength training for your breathing muscles”, it uses a hand-held medical device that provides resistance as a person inhales through a tube. Scientists say it can lower cardiovascular disease risk in aging adults—and could also aid athletes in running faster marathons. High-Resistance Inspiratory Muscle Strength Training (IMST) is meant to be done in reps like high-intensity interval training, with quicker, higher resistance breaths leading to “cardiovascular, cognitive, and sports performance improvements.” The technique could be even more effective at lowering blood pressure than going for a run, especially in postmenopausal women. Professor Doug Seals at the University of Colorado Boulder hailed it as an easy and drug-free option. Developed in the 1980s for respiratory disease to help patients strengthen their diaphragm and other breathing muscles, the regimen was prescribed for 30-minute-per-day at low resistance. But inspired by HIIT, researchers now believe 30 inhalations a day at high resistance, six days per week, could reap many benefits. : The study, the Journal of the American Heart Association, recruited 36 healthy adults aged 50 to 79 with above-normal blood pressure with half doing high resistance IMST for six weeks and the others doing a placebo where the resistance was much lower. Even six weeks after they quit doing IMST, they maintained most of that improvement. The treatment group also saw a 45% improvement in vascular endothelial function, or the ability for arteries to expand upon stimulation, and a significant increase in levels of nitric oxide, a molecule key for dilating arteries and preventing plaque buildup. Nitric oxide levels naturally decline with age. The IMST group saw their systolic blood pressure dip nine points on average, a reduction generally exceeds that achieved by walking 30 minutes a day five days a week. That decline is also equal to the effects of some blood presssure-lowering drugs. “We found that not only is it more time-efficient than traditional exercise programs, but the benefits may also be longer-lasting,” said lead author Dr. Daniel Craighead, at UC Boulder. “If aerobic exercise won’t improve this key measure of cardiovascular health for postmenopausal women, they need another lifestyle intervention that will. This could be it.” : Craighead, who uses IMST for his own aerobic training, added, “It’s easy to do, it doesn’t take long, and we think it has a lot of potential to help a lot of people.” Indeed, to have a form of therapy available that lowers blood pressure without drugs, or doing aerobic exercise, which so many people tend to abhor, would be a great option. The National Institutes of Health recently awarded Seals $4 million to launch a larger follow-up study of about 100 people, comparing a 12-week IMST protocol head-to-head with aerobic exercise. Meanwhile, the a smartphone app to enable people to do the protocol at home using already commercially available devices.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/breathing-with-this-device-for-5-minutes-may-lower-blood-pressure-as-much-as-exercise-or-drugs-study/
"Our partner Rob Brezsny provides his weekly wisdom to enlighten our thinking and motivate our mood. Rob’s , is a syndicated weekly column appearing in over a hundred publications. He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Author Katherine Mansfield once told her friend Virginia Woolf, “You put me in touch with my own soul.” I’m sorry Mansfield didn’t previously have that precious connection, but I’m elated that Woolf helped her make it. In the coming weeks, I expect you will encounter an abundance of influences like Woolf: people and animals and places and experiences that can bring you into more intimate contact with your soul. I hope you take full advantage. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): At the age of 70, Libran novelist mused, “I know now, what I didn’t then, that affection can’t always be expressed in calm, orderly, articulate ways; and that one cannot prescribe the form it should take for anyone else.” In that spirit, Libra, and in accordance with astrological omens, I authorize you to express affection in lively, unruly, demonstrative ways. Give yourself permission to be playfully imaginative, exuberantly revelatory, and vivaciously animated as you show the people and animals you cherish the nature of your feelings for them. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Do you Scorpios lie to yourselves more than the other signs lie to themselves? Are you especially prone to undermine yourselves through self-deception? I don’t think so. However, you might be among the signs most likely to mislead or beguile other people. (But here’s a caveat: On some occasions, your trickery is in a good cause, because it serves the needs of the many, not just yourself.) In any case, dear Scorpio, I will ask you to minimize all such behavior during the next five weeks. I think your success will depend on you being exceptionally honest and genuine—both to yourself and to others. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): “I like being broken,” says Sagittarius actor Jamie Campbell Bower. “It means I can have chocolate for breakfast.” I guess that when he feels down, he gives himself special permission to enjoy extra treats and privileges. According to my assessment of the astrological omens, you now have the right to give yourself similar permission—even though I don’t expect you’ll be broken or feeling down. Think of it as a reward for the brave work you’ve been doing lately. Enjoy this chocolatey grace period! CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): (1907–1972) was a Jewish theologian born under the sign of Capricorn. He wrote, “Indifference to the sublime wonder of living is the root of sin.” That’s a different definition of sin from what we’re used to! To be a moral person, Heschel believed, you must be in “radical amazement” about the glories of creation. I hope you will cultivate such an attitude in the coming weeks, Capricorn. It would be a mistake for you to numbly take things for granted. I dare you to cultivate as much awe, reverence, and adoration as you can muster. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): A blogger who calls herself Hopeful Melancholy wrote a message to her lover. She said, “My favorite position is the one where you work on your paintings and I work on my book, but we’re in the same room and occasionally smile at each other.” You might want to consider trying experiments comparable to that one in the coming weeks, Aquarius. The time will be fertile for you and your dear allies to work side-by-side; to cheer each other on and lift each other up; to explore new ways of cultivating companionship and caring for each other. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Dick Dudley was a 17th-century swindler. Among his many victims was the Pope. Dudley offered an item for sale that he claimed was a divine relic: a piece of the beard of St. Peter, founder of the Roman Catholic Church. The Pope paid Dudley a small fortune for the treasure, and kissed it copiously. Only later did the full story emerge: The so-called beard was in fact a wig. I hope you don’t get involved in switcheroos like that anytime soon, Pisces. Make sure that the goods or services you’re receiving—and offering, for that matter—are exactly what they’re supposed to be. ARIES (March 21-April 19): Here are examples of activities I recommend you try in the coming days. 1. Build a campfire on the beach with friends and regale each other with stories of your most interesting successes. 2. Buy eccentric treasures at a flea market and ever thereafter refer to them as your holy icons. 3. Climb a hill and sit on the grass as you sing your favorite songs and watch the moon (full tonight) slowly rise over the eastern horizon. 4. Take naps when you’re “not supposed to.” 5. Tell a beloved person a fairy tale in which he or she is the hero. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): The popular American TV sitcom produced 138 episodes in seven seasons. At the height of its success, it crammed an average of 9.57 jokes into every minute. Its comic richness derived in large part from multi-talented Taurus star Tina Fey, who created the show and played one of its main characters. She was also a writer and executive producer. I propose we make her your role model in the coming weeks. According to my projections, you’re entering a charismatic, ebullient, and creative phase of your astrological cycle. It’s time to be generous to the parts of your life that need big happy doses of release and liberation. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): I got an email from a Gemini reader named Jaylah. She wrote, “Hi, not sure if you remember me, but in our past lives, you and I used to write sacred cuneiform texts on clay tablets while sitting across from each other in a cave in Mesopotamia 4,910 years ago. Your name was Nabu. Mine was Tashmetu. I was always a little jealous because you earned more money than I, but it didn’t get in the way of our friendship. Anyway, if you ever want to catch up about the old days, give me a holler.” I loved receiving this inquiry from a soul I may have known in a previous incarnation. And what she did by reaching out to me happens to be the perfect type of activity for you Geminis right now. Secrets of your history may be more available than usual. The past may have new stories to tell. A resource from yesteryear could prove valuable in the future. CANCER (June 21-July 22): Cancerian-born was an interesting writer and a master of language. But even for him, it could be a challenge to convey what he really meant. He said, “I am constantly trying to communicate something incommunicable, to explain something inexplicable, to tell about something I only feel in my bones and which can only be experienced in those bones.” Now here’s the good news, as far as you’re concerned, Cancerian: I suspect that in the coming weeks, you will have more power than usual to do exactly what Kafka aspired to do. You will be able to summon extra ease and grace in expressing your truths. I invite you to be a connoisseur of deep conversations. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): “If we wait until we are ready, we will be waiting for the rest of our lives,” declared novelist . This is good advice for you to heed right now. I really hope you avoid the temptation to wait around for the perfect moment before you begin. In my vision of your best approach, you will dive into the future without trying to have all your plans finalized and all your assets gathered. I expect you will acquire the rest of what you need once the process is underway.

"If you feel like you’re hoarding plastic containers in your home, you’re not alone. A new poll found 62% of Americans surveyed would rather keep them for possible reuse than throw it away. The study asked 2,000 adults about their plastic habits and what they’d like to improve. Over half (55%) said they’d rather keep plastic containers and other plastic wares, rather than throw them away. Half of respondents keep a bag stuffed with plastic bags in their house. 44% say they have a kitchen drawer with plastic cutlery. 39% have a cabinet full of mismatched Tupperware, and almost one in five have a cabinet storing old jars (18%). Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of , the results also found that 55% don’t want to throw out plastics in their home without reusing them. In fact, sixty-four percent of respondents said they never need to buy Tupperware, because they have plenty of other containers they’ve saved. Three in five said they always try to make a conscious effort to repurpose or upcycle items. They ask themselves “Can this be recycled?” an average of four times a week and end up tossing another four items in the recycling bin that they’re not even 100% certain can be recycled. “It’s common to feel that you might not be making a difference by recycling, but it’s important to remember you are,” said a spokesperson for Core Hydration. : “Choosing products made with recycled materials is a simple step in the right direction and keeps the plastic within the circular economy,” they added. The survey also asked for examples of how people had been repurposing items. One respondent said they were growing garlic inside cut-off water bottles. Plastic jugs are also being reused as pots for plants. 1. Created an original piece of rustic artwork to pep up a bare wall by repurposing wooden window shutters. 2. Growing garlic in cut-off water bottles. 3. Having saved quite a few big coffee containers, I use them for cat litter in winter, for birdseed, and the grandkids like to use them to dig in the garden with. 4. Those round plastic lids from toddler food pouches are good for lots of things, teaching kids colors, sorting, and even stacking to build towers. 5. I have turned old frames into jewelry hangers and bottles into flower pots and candle holders. 6. I repurposed a foam egg crate from my new bed, turning it into a bed for my dog. 7. I reuse glass yogurt containers for individual dessert cups/servings. 8. Turned a ladder into a bookshelf. 9. Taking plastic jars, removing labels, painting and decoupage them into attractive vases or pencil holders or decorated for use for cotton balls, etc. :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/americans-hoard-plastic-containers-rather-than-tossing-onepoll/
"A teenager who rescued a bumblebee says it’s now a loyal pet, following her everywhere, and even sleeping in a jar by her bed. It all started two weeks ago when Lacey Shillinglaw, 13, spotted the large bumblebee lying in the road while walking her dog. She scooped up the bee and noticed it had a crumpled wing. She tried to put it in a safer spot, on some flowers in a nearby park, but it refused to stay put, buzzing back over to Lacey and crawling all over her, and after an hour she gave up and headed home with the creature perched on her shoulder. Despite repeated attempts to leave the insect outside, the buzzy friend has refused to leave Lacey’s side. Now recovered and named Betty, it follows her to the shops and even stayed with Lacey during games at the bowling alley with 14 friends. She stayed on Lacey throughout both games—for two-and-a-half hours. “I’m so happy and I just love spending my time with her,” said the girl from Coventry, West Midlands. “She’s so fluffy and I love our friendship.” On the way home Betty was perching on the girl’s glasses as she went into her local shop to buy milk—shocking other shoppers. The insect apparently enjoys nibbling on Lacey’s food, but also gets fed sugar water, honey, and strawberry jam. Lacey takes her bee-pal into the garden to feast on flower nectar, but as soon as the teen goes back inside, Betty is right beside her. At night Lacey tucks Betty up in a little pot beside her bed, and while there is no lid, the animal stays put until morning. : During the day Betty nestles on the back of Lacey’s neck, or inside her sleeve, between buzzes around the living room. “It’s completely lovely—and also bonkers,” said her mother, Laura. “Betty climbs in Lacey’s long hair like it’s some kind of jungle. “She’s on her 90% of the time during the day, including her face, her glasses, and even in between her toes. It’s so beautiful—just gorgeous.” Betty apparently even enjoys a stroke between the wings, but steers clear of the rest of the family—mom, dad and two younger siblings. : “We have all the doors open a lot and she’s just never gone —I haven’t the foggiest why,” said Laura. Bumblebees sting and, unlike honeybees, they can repeatedly sting you without dying—but this has never happened because these two have become Bee-FFs. “Betty is totally amazing—I’ll remember this forever,” says Lacey. the video below…",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/teen-rescues-bumblebee-and-now-it-wont-leave-her-side/
"An ocean of kindness has swept over a loving mom and her son after strangers learned about her ingenuity in the face of poverty—and it inspired a whole community. Tiffany Holloway wrote a post on Reddit about how her son wanted a stuffed manta ray for his 5th birthday. She couldn’t afford to buy one so she crafted one—and made it out of his old baby blanket. The with button eyes became the No.1 post on Reddit (the largest online forum in the world) and soon hundreds of readers were sending Jason toy manta rays, squids, and other plush ocean creatures. But the fun didn’t stop there for the Oklahoma tot and his siblings. One Redditor, who wants to remain anonymous, contacted the Blue Zoo and had them hold a $100 gift card for the family, which they used for admission, so that Jonas— whose hero is Steve Irwin—could see and touch some sting rays. Jennifer Prokop (username ) bought Tiffany and her four boys tickets to the Oklahoma City Zoo, as well as four tickets to feed the sting rays. “Jonas got to see and touch and even feed his favorite animal,” Tiffany told GNN. “Jennifer and I have become fast friends. She is an amazing kind person with a big heart.” They stayed alongside the pool for over an hour, even as most guests moved on after a few minutes. “The boys loved it.” “My son’s favorite part of all this is having a bunch of sea friends to cuddle with at night. He has so many stuffed sea animals there is barely any room for him on his bed but he insists on sleeping with all of them.” : “Jonas is a child that rarely smiles because of all the trauma he’s been through,” she said in an email. “This outpouring of love and kindness has brought an oh-so-rare smile to his face—and that is worth more to me than anything else.” “It was a reminder for me that even when we are struggling and feel alone there are good people in the world who will offer you support and compassion when you need it the most.” : A was started by their new friend, Jennifer, to accept donations to the family.

"4Ocean, the guys who you may have seen on Instagram selling bracelets made out of ocean plastic as a way to fund their ocean cleanup, have enlisted the help of new and extra-special beachcomber in their land-based campaign to end ocean plastic pollution. The electric-powered, sand-sifting BeBot can clean up to 3,000 square meters, or 33,000 square feet, of beach per hour, making it 20-30x more effective than collecting trash by hand. The machine is agile and easy to maneuver, a clear differentiator from existing options which tend to be derived from retired agricultural equipment powered by gas, making them less-suited to delicate beach work. It specifically excels at removing small pieces of plastic and other trash that are notoriously difficult to clean by hand, using small 1 cm x 1 cm sifting grids to separate these items from the sand. A pair of triangular tracks gives the BeBot a smaller footprint, while a shallower cleaning depth of 10 cm effectively removes common beach trash while avoiding disruptions to any nearby habitats or animals, providing a more effective and sustainable approach to cleanups. A remote-controlled robot, the beach-cleaner can be operated from up to 950 feet away. BeBot comes out of a marine-technology firm called , that among many other projects such as robotics, specializes in building aluminum marinas. They construct floating solar panel banks, and other cool aqua-tech like the “mooring star,” which is essentially a giant addition sign that allows nature parks to greatly increase their boat mooring potential whilst protecting shorelines. “BeBot has groundbreaking and unprecedented environmental assets,” Claire Touvier, member of the Environmental Solutions team from Poralu Marine. “With a unique track system distributing equal and minimum pressure on the sand, BeBot reduces erosion. This innovative design also helps the preservation of biodiversity as it prevents the compression of turtles’ eggs and any vegetal ecosystem in the sand.” “We are always searching for innovative technology to improve our cleanup capabilities,” said Alex Schultze, co-founder of “With the launch of the BeBot, we are able to work smarter and sustainably while recovering plastic that has already seen the ocean and preventing new plastic from ever getting there in the first place.” In a statement, 4Ocean revealed that they were on track to remove their twenty millionth pound of plastic trash from the ocean, despite lifting pound number sixteen million just one month ago. This is a more than 100% increase from 16 months before when they were “closing in” on their eight millionth pound, a milestone it took them almost three years to reach.

"Major moments from modern history have been reimagined as ‘ancient’ cave art. 2,000 UK adults had their say on what moments from the worlds of sport, technology, politics, and popular culture should be immortalized in Buckinghamshire’s Hellfire Caves. Using the same techniques, style, and colors as our ancestors more than 30,000 years ago, illustrator Emmy Smith worked with archaeologist Professor Paul Pettitt to make the paintings as authentic as possible. Other noteworthy moments featured include Barack Obama becoming the first Black President of America, Live Aid, and Maradona’s ‘Hand of God’. commissioned the cave art and the poll to celebrate the launch of new historical strategy game, HUMANKIND, which enables players to create and lead their own unique civilization. Paul Pettitt, Professor in the Department of Archaeology at Durham University, said: “Ancient humans used cave art for thousands of years to record the most important concerns of their time. “And I’m thrilled SEGA has used the oldest artistic medium to bring some of modern history’s most iconic moments to life. “Rock art was a universal form of expression, with examples found all over the world. “It was an enjoyable challenge working out how to translate the events of the last few decades, both monumental and mundane, into authentic cave art—I’m extremely proud of the results.” The poll found 72 percent of adults believe it’s ‘important’ that key events from modern history are shared with future generations. And 62 percent think cave art is a great way to learn about history from those who lived during that time. Furthermore, 51 percent think cave paintings are more likely to survive for thousands of years than any form of modern technology. More than half (51 percent) also think cave paintings are more likely to survive for thousands of years than any form of modern technology. It also emerged that those polled think Sir David Attenborough (27 percent) would be the best person to lead modern civilization. But Manchester United and England star, Marcus Rashford (eight percent) got twice as many votes as current UK prime minister, Boris Johnson (four percent). While 34 percent think they would do either a good or excellent job if they themselves were in charge. Their priorities would include providing free healthcare to all (46 percent), ensuring equal rights for everyone (36 percent), and implementing a four-day working week (19 percent).

"Finding fossilized dinosaur eggs is not unheard of, but finding the fossilized remains of an embryo within the egg is rare indeed. Fortunately for a pair of paleontologists working in one of Earth’s great honeypot regions for dinosaur bones—North China—a local farmer had a few gems lying around to check over and inspect. In a box of what the farmer believed were strange, intriguing rocky orbs, scientists Fenglu Han and Haishui Jiang noticed one that was different enough to merit closer examination. The bony remains of the treasure contained within the eggshell were the only clues the scientists had to its origin, and while the farmer led them to the site where he found it, subsequently discovered specimens had held up very poorly over the years. Egg in possession, Jiang and Han looked to examine it using micro-computed tomography, which would allow them to peer through the shell’s exterior. What they found was a jumble of bones which consultants determined looked strikingly like a turtle embryo. Belonging to an extinct genus of giant land tortoises called that lived among the Cretaceous period—the geological curtain call of the age of dinosaurs—the find “is one of the largest and thickest shelled Mesozoic turtle eggs known,” write the authors in a in The turtle which laid the egg would have been among the largest turtles to ever exist, and from shell tip to shell tail would have been as tall as a grown man. How the turtle might have lived is difficult to imagine. All scientists know was that it was a plant eater, but the details within the eggshell may hint at what its habitat was like when it lived 144 to 66 million years ago. “The thick-shelled, spherical eggs of may have been an adaptation, at least in part, to incubation in harsh arid environments,” write the authors in their paper. “Among [living] turtles, a calcified rigid shell limits the movement of water outside the eggshell to prevent excess water loss of the egg during incubation. Spherical eggs can also reduce water loss and thickened eggshell in some reptiles may be an adaptation to an arid climate.” As scientists discussed, the baby turtle would have to be a little Hercules to push his way out of such a thick shell. While went extinct along with the non-avian dinosaurs, their aquatic relatives sailed right on through, along with other success stories like crocodiles, snakes, and ocean life. The giant tortoises of the Galapagos are slow-moving plant eaters, similar to Putting them in the post-asteroidal apocalypse that occurred on Earth, when much of the plant life died out, would probably see them die off like their ancient ancestors.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/fossilized-turtle-embryo-found-in-china-reveals-history-of-the-ancient-family/
"It’s hard work being a farmer, that is until you pull a half-ton sapphire out of the ground while digging a well… Then it’s pretty incredible being a farmer. A boulder containing a cluster of 2.5 million carats in star sapphires was unearthed by workmen digging a well on the island of Sri Lanka, a country which, like a diamond, belittles its size in terms of richness. Colored pale blue, the find has been given the name the ‘Serendipity Sapphire’, and could be worth $140 million on the international market, pending inspections and certification by world experts. “The person who was digging the well alerted us about some rare stones. Later we stumbled upon this huge specimen,” Mr. Gamage, the owner of the stone, . Gamage, who kept most information confidential for obvious reasons, explained that while cleaning the stone of mud and dirt, some star sapphires of “high quality” became dislodged, suggesting that like , this enormous half-ton stone isn’t a single structure, but likely hundreds of star sapphires connected together with other minerals. In a country blessed with beautiful beaches, rich wildlife, tons of elephants, and as the story goes, the mountain from which the Buddha of this eon ascended to Buddhahood, the gemstone trade on Sri Lanka is one of the most important on Earth. The island nation, no bigger than West Virginia, is the world’s leading exporter of sapphires and other precious stones, which generated half a billion in revenue last year as gem producers. The Serendipity Sapphire was mined in the area of Ratnapura, a traditional gem mining region famous for producing star sapphires, like the last one that was considered the largest ever, , weighing 1404 carets. Ratnapura means “City of Gems” in Sinhalese, and even as competitive markets for sapphires open up in Madagascar, Ratnapura remains a world capital in the gem trade. “It is a special star sapphire specimen, probably the biggest in the world. Given the size and its value, we think it will interest private collectors or museums,” Thilak Weerasinghe, the Chairman of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority of Sri Lanka, told the BBC. Star sapphires contain a gemological feature known as an asterism. Asterisms in gems occur when small flakes or spines of other material becomes trapped in the gemstone as it forms, creating an effect when receiving light from above of a shining six-pointed star. , currently held in the American Museum of Natural History.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/2-5-million-caret-sapphire-discovered-in-sri-lanka-weighing-half-a-ton/

"Polish javelin thrower Maria Andrejczyk took the silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics. While she might have come in second at the games, what she did next was pure gold. Less than two weeks after ascending the winner’s podium, Andrejczyk took an extraordinary leap of generosity, auctioning off her medal to raise funds for Miłoszek Małys, an 8-month-old Polish boy in critical need of heart surgery. The athlete had never met Miłoszek or his family. She learned of his struggles through social media. But 25-year-old Andrejczyk, a cancer survivor herself, knew just how important obtaining timely medical intervention could be. “Miłoszek has a serious heart defect, he needs an operation,” Andrejczyk posted to her . “He also has support from above from Kubuś—a boy who did not make it on time, but wonderful people decided to donate his funds to Miłoszek. And this is how I want to help too. It is for him that I am auctioning off my Olympic silver medal.” All told, it was estimated that costs for medical expenses plus travel from Poland to California’s Stanford University where the operation would be performed would total 1.5 million Polish zlotys (about $385,000). With half the sum already raised through online contributions, Andrejczyk hoped her medal would bring in the rest. The winning bid not only met but exceeded the original fundraising goals. “We have the winner!” Andrejczyk posted. “On Friday I received this wonderful information, and due to the fact that you dears have already done wonders and joint forces have paid more than the equivalent of the initial medal to the Miłoszek account—I decided to end the auction so that our Miłoszek will receive the whole amount as soon as possible and can fly to the USA.” Sorry as she might have been to see her medal go, Andrejczyk was thrilled to know the profits from its sale were earmarked for a worthy cause. “The true value of a medal always remains in the heart,” Andrejczyk said, as quoted by . “A medal is only an object, but it can be of great value to others. This silver can save lives, instead of collecting dust in a closet. That is why I decided to auction it to help sick children.” But it seems the winning bidders, Polish convenience store chain Zabka, had some pretty big-hearted plans of their own. In honor of her winning ways both on the Olympic field and off, the company gifted Andrejczyk back her medal. “We were moved by the beautiful and extremely noble gesture of our Olympian, we decided to support [the benefit],” Zabka posted to Facebook. “We also decided that the silver medal from Tokyo will stay with Ms. Maria, who showed what it means to be [a true champion].” While silver has always been considered a precious metal, in this case, its value in helping save the life of a child was priceless—and that’s a win of Olympic proportions for everyone.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/maria-andrejczyk-auctions-silver-medal-for-infants-heart-surgery/
"A hero schoolgirl who saved people trapped in a burning apartment raised the alarm after being inspired by a TV show about the emergency services. 14-year-old Lily Swanson is obsessed with the Disney+ show so when she noticed a strong burning smell she immediately stopped to investigate. She had been on a walk with her Rottweiler Isobel near her home in Leyland, Lancashire, but decided to try and find the source of the smell. The quick-thinking teenager looked around and finally spotted black smoke billowing out of an apartment window on Hough Lane. Lily ran home to wake her dad Mike Swanson and rang 999. Mike grabbed his ladders and ran to the scene to help those trapped inside before the building was engulfed in flames. Lily said, “As soon as I called the fire brigade, we ran back outside and we could see people hanging out the window. “It had only been a minute or two since I first saw the smoke but as we were running over to help them, one of the windows blew off and fell into the street. “That’s when me and my dad saw the flames. I told my dad we should try and get everyone out of the other window above the barber’s next door. “We opened the ladders and leaned them against the building and there were two or three people trying to climb out. They were desperate.” Thankfully, everyone was evacuated safely after emergency services arrived at the scene just minutes later. Lily added, “But then the fire brigade showed up very quickly and took over. We couldn’t believe how fast they got there. “We did everything we could do and thankfully everyone got out safely, which is the best that could have happened.” Lily and her dad stayed at the scene while fire crews evacuated the building and ensured everyone was safe. Mike said, “It was a proud dad moment for me, as it could have been a lot worse if it wasn’t for Lily’s quick response. “She’s been obsessed with this TV programme on Disney+. It’s about emergency services in America who deal with things like this. “Then this happened practically on our doorstep and she handled it brilliantly. I’m very proud.” Leyland fire station manager Jonny Nottingham, who was the incident commander on the night of the fire, praised Lily for her quick and calm response. Mr Nottingham said, “We’d like to thank Lily for calling us so quickly after spotting the fire in the apartment. “We have seen in the past that people can have lots of different reactions to seeing a fire but Lily showed maturity and calmness beyond her years to quickly and effectively notify us.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/hero-schoolgirl-fire-lancashire-lily-swanson/
"The English phrase about someone being “silver-tongued” clearly runs cross-culturally, as recently a set of mummies were unearthed in Egypt, and one was buried with a golden tongue. The mummies date to the Greco-Roman period of Egypt after it had come under the thumb of the Northern Mediterranean following the conquests of Alexander the Great, and were found in gilded sarcophagi buried in rock-cut “wall-hole” tombs in the Temple of Taposiris Magna in the Classical-Era city of the same name. Within these small chambers, the mummies were in a poor state of preservation, which highlights, according to a from the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, the characteristics of mummification in the Greek and Roman periods. A gold foil amulet, shaped in the form of a tongue, was found placed in the mouth of a mummy in a special ritual to ensure their ability to speak before the Osirian court in the afterlife. Osiris was the god of the underworld, and it would be considered vital for people to have a way to speak with him. It’s not clear, but the gold tongue might have been related to that idea, although brought up that perhaps the deceased had a speech impediment. The two most important mummies were wrapped in golden bonds of papyrus. One bore decorations characteristic of Osiris, while the other wore an Atef crown, sporting horns and a coiled cobra around the head, and a falcon design on their chest to honor the god Horus. The discovery was made by a joint Egypt-Dominican team, led by Dr. Kathleen Martinez. They also discovered eight marble masks depicting faces of the Roman and Greco influence in the region with striking detail, and a near-body-length female funerary mask. “In the last 10 years, the mission has found several important archaeological finds that have changed our perception of the Temple of Taposiris Magna,” read the statement on the Ministry’s website. “A number of coins bearing the name and image of Queen Cleopatra VII were found inside the temple walls, in addition to many parts of statues.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/mummies-found-with-golden-tongues-in-egypt-city-of-taposiris/
"In concluding their expedition to Wolf Volcano, on Isabela Island in the Galápagos, scientists have conducted the first survey of the pink land iguana, a criticallyendangered species that lives nowhere else on Earth. The survey used camera traps and involved 30 scientists spreading out over nearly 1,000 acres of the “most inhospitable places in Galápagos,” positively identifying 53 adult pink land iguanas, but no juveniles. The effort which took place through early-to-mid August was led by Conservation Manager Jorge Carrión and Conservation Director Washington Tapia at the Galápagos Conservancy, who have overseen some remarkable close shaves at their hugely successful Giant Tortoise Restoration Initiative. The pair recently reported on their , and how with a little data, and a little hope, they believe they can rescue this quite recently-discovered species from the brink on which it was found. “They are iconic as much for being recently discovered and limited to a small geographic area, as for the inherent challenges of managing the future of an animal of which we know very little about,” Carrión wrote, at the Conservancy’s . The challenges of conserving them are partly the terrain, as Carrión details, for Wolf Volcano is as unwelcoming as a wolf or volcano. The iguanas nest at 5,600 feet above sea level, where the there is little shade, and the temperatures can rise to 100 °F, and 160 °F at the level of the ground. At night however, the temperature plummets to 50 °F, but strong, constant and freezing wind. The steep, mountainous ground is littered with cacti, and there are more ticks on Isabella than any other island. Finally, the iguanas can easily bite a finger off if they get the opportunity, so handling them is so sure bet. “During the expedition, we documented never-before-seen behavior such as the symbiotic relationship with Darwin’s finches, which feed on parasites on the iguana’s body, and the unusual sight of an iguana seeking out the sun on a tree branch in an area where the sunlight couldn’t penetrate the dense undergrowth.” The last juvenile was spotted in 2014, just five years after the species was first officially described as different from both the normal, and yellow land iguanas of the famous islands. Using the mark and recapture method of analysis, the Conservancy on Isabella. Iguana experts from around the world, at the behest of the Galápagos National Park Directorate, arrived for a brainstorming event on the data gathered during the expedition in late August. With their help, the Directorate and the Conservancy hope to craft the first action plan for saving the pink iguana.

"In the face of a legal challenge mounted by six Native American Tribes, a district court judge in Arizona has thrown out a Trump-era interpretation of the Clean Waters Act (CWA) that would allow actors to fill in, pollute, or dredge wetlands, streams, and marshlands, District Judge Rosemary Marquez noted that there were numerous “serious errors” in the regulation that was passed to help states better identify and manage waters that are legally protected by the CWA. It was in June that the Biden Administration they would revisit Trump’s Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR), but it was Marquez who felt that leaving it in place while new rules were made risked causing “serious environmental harm.” Marquez’s decision applies nationwide, according to the , and will protect drinking water and wildlife habitat for millions of Americans and billions of animals. As with most legal challenges in this country, the battle arose over unclear language. “To restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters,” the purpose of the CWA, defining the nation’s waters as “navigable waters of the United States, including territorial seas.” Navigable waters could mean a number of things. For starters, navigable by whom, humans or fish? Based on that lack of clarity, farmers and industry pushed the Trump Administration to allow the states to determine the fate of as many bodies of water as could be found without clear federal protection. These included feeder streams, marshes, and wetlands. In 2006, Justice Antonin Scalia authored a four-justice opinion which stated waters of the United States should be “relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water forming geographic features,” adding that “only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are ‘waters of the United States’.” However the Obama Administration’s revisiting of the CWA added federal protection for waters that were not “standing or continuously flowing,” like marshes that might feed a river far away, or even streams which only come alive during periods of heavy rainfall, such as a desert wash. It was these protections Trump acquiesced to eliminate. Indeed report from the Army Corps of Engineers, whose job it is to grant permits for dredging or filling waterways, stated that 333 currently-submitted projects would have required environmental review under the Obama rules, but not under Trump’s. The lawsuit was launched on behalf of six Native American Tribes by Earth Justice, who noted that between June 22, 2020 and April 15, 2021, the Corps approved jurisdictional determinations under the NWPR of 40,211 aquatic resources or water features, and found that approximately 76% were vulnerable under the NWPR. In states like Arizona and New Mexico where water resources are exceedingly precious, they found that almost every one of the 1,500 assessed ephemeral streams and washes were non-jurisdictional of the CWA. Marquez ruled that the potential ruination of these waters while the Biden team conduct their review could have “cascading and cumulative downstream effects,” invalidated and remanded the NWPR, and sent it off to the Corps and the EPA for review. “The sacred waters that were put at risk by the Trump administration are essential to our cultural and religious lives as indigenous people,” said Tohono O’odham Nation Chairman Ned Norris, Jr., whose tribe participated in the lawsuit. “This decision by the court rightfully vacates a grievous error.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/arizona-judge-throws-out-trump-clean-water-act-rule-saving-thousands-of-streams/
"It might be “herd” to believe, but some Louisiana cowboys recently undertook a very different kind of cattle drive after Hurricane Ida left grazing lands flooded—and they’ve been using airboats to do get the job done. “We got about 300 head of cattle… out here that we couldn’t get out from the back pastures in time before the storm came in, being that it was a quickly developing storm,” lead volunteer Derek Billiot told . In storms past, Billiot routinely employed his airboat to rescue people rather than livestock. This time, luckily, since most folks who found themselves in Ida’s path heeded advance evacuation orders, he didn’t have to. So far, Billiot and his water-skimming crew have rounded up about 60 head of cattle in Parish Plaquemines. The exhausted bovines aren’t always 100% cooperative, but at present, the rescuers are taking a “no cow left behind” attitude. Many of the stranded animals are mired in mud and trapped by marsh debris. The volunteers have been attempting to coax the heifers to higher ground when possible, but mostly, they’ve had to resort to roping the flood victims and dragging them to safety. While this good Samaritan-led cattle drive is a serious business, Billiot can’t help but see the lighter side of the roundup. “Welcome to south Louisiana,” he quipped. “ rodeoing.” ( one of the im- -vable cows below.)

"A cure for osteoarthritis could be no further than the end of your nose—as nasal cells can relieve chronic inflammation in the knee, according to new research. Doctors say the treatment could revolutionize therapy for a crippling condition that impacts 8.5 million people in the UK alone. The cells originate from embryonic brain and spinal cord tissue—known as the neuroectoderm. Co-lead author Professor Ivan Martin, of Basel University in Switzerland, described them as “amazing.” He explained, “Unlike the cartilage tissue in the joints, these cartilage cells originate from precursor cells of the neuroectoderm. They therefore have a distinct regenerative and adaptive capacity—or plasticity. Tissue grown from nasal cartilage cells seems also to retain these special properties.” Unlike other tissues cartilage that cushions the surface of joints has little capacity to grow back. Osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, can lead to damage. Knee replacement surgery is often the only option. Now clinical studies have shown cartilage cells from the nasal septum, the partition that divides the nostrils, combat the disease. Orthopaedic and plastic surgeons took a tissue sample from the noses of two patients—and cultivated them in the lab. They then used them to grow a cartilage layer that was then implanted into the knee joint. The young volunteers had severe osteoarthritis due to misalignment of the leg bones. They faced having a whole knee prosthesis. But following implantation of the engineered cartilage both reported a reduction in pain, and increased quality of life. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans showed the bones in the knee of one of the patients were further apart than previously. This was an indication of the joint’s recovery. The other volunteer could only be interviewed for a subjective assessment owing to the pandemic. The bones in both volunteers could be surgically corrected—and the most likely cause of their osteoarthritis eliminated, said the researchers. They are confident patients will be able to manage without knee joint prostheses, at least for some time. Martin said, “Our results have enabled us to lay the biological foundation for a therapy, and we are cautiously optimistic.” Unlike knee traumas caused by sports injuries and falls, an osteoarthritic knee suffers persistent inflammatory reactions. Martin said, “First we had to test whether the cartilage replacement was attacked and degenerated by the inflammatory factors.” The international team initially tested human cartilage tissue in the presence of inflammatory factors. Experiments were carried out in mice and various other models of the disease. Martin said, “First we had to test whether the cartilage replacement was attacked and degenerated by the inflammatory factors.” The durability of the tissue was also tested under stress and inflammation in sheep. Cartilage cells were taken from the nose of the animals and transplanted into their osteoarthritic knee joints. The tissue proved to be extremely robust—and also seemed to counteract the inflammatory reactions. Further analysis suggested the effect was caused by a chemicals fuelled by osteoarthritis, known as the WNT signaling pathway. The study, published in the journal , found it was dampened by by the presence of the nasal cartilage cells. In-depth clinical trials using the approach for the treatment of patellofemoral osteoarthritis are now being planned. It’s caused when the articular cartilage wears out and the bone ends rub on one another,  causing extreme pain. The researchers also aim to further develop the method for other types of osteoarthritis to treat a broader spectrum of patients. They pioneered nose-to-knee cartilage transplants a decade ago in nine patients who had suffered sports injuries, falls or other accidents. It followed successful experiments in goats. This is the first time it has been used for osteoarthritis. Globally it affects more than 300 million people. It occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of the bones wears down over time. Osteoarthritis can damage any joint but is usually found in the hands, knees, hips and spine. Osteoarthritis symptoms can usually be managed—although the damage to joints can’t be reversed. Staying active, maintaining a healthy weight and receiving certain treatments might slow progression and improve pain and joint function.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cure-for-osteoarthritis-basel-university/
"Registering 10,000 steps a day with a pedometer is a fine goal that deserves celebration, but far from being a doctor-recommended dose of activity, it’s actually a complete myth. The good news is that for most people whose physical activity is limited to walking, one need only accumulate between 4,500 and 7,000 steps a day to reduce, sometimes dramatically, their chance of dying young. Most governments, and we can start with the CDC at home, of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. The measurement is made with a unit of time and not of repetitions, which has its limits, as some studies show number of steps correlates more strongly with lower disease risk . According to Gretchen Reynolds the goal of accumulating 10,000 steps in a day for fitness’ sake is actually based on a fad invented by a Tokyo watchmaker in the wake of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, when more and more people in the city became interested in health and fitness. Like a harmless version of the other falsehoods in eastern medicinal practices (rhino horn tea anyone?) the idea that somehow 10,000 steps was the threshold for some exceptional therapeutic results spread across the globe. In reality 10,000 steps is almost 5 miles, a lot more than is necessary for lowering your disease risk. Reynolds points to a 2019 study that found woman in their 70s who managed just 4,500 steps a day lowered their risk for premature death of any cause by 40%, compared to those who walked just 2,700 steps or less. In a in 2020, it was found that among 4,840 adults aged 40 and up, walking 8,000 steps per day was enough to reduce risk of premature death by 49%. However the critical detail is that between 4,000 to 8,000 steps, the benefit was immense, but between 8,000 and 12,000, the benefit diminished, suggesting there is fast-approaching upper limit of how much benefit the mere act of walking will confer. It’s actually a good thing, probably, to suggest trying to walk 10,000 steps, but rather to walk between 6,000 to 8,000 steps, and use the time one saved to do other physical activities of equal importance such as weight training or stretching—both key factors in preventing various pathologies of morbidity like muscle and bone-density loss, or the loss in flexibility.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/if-your-health-goal-is-to-walk-10000-steps-a-day-7000-is-enough/
"Although thousands of planets have been discovered in the Milky Way, most reside less than a few thousand light years from Earth. Yet our Galaxy is more than 100,000 light years across, making it difficult to investigate the Galactic distribution of planets. But now, a research team has found a way to overcome this hurdle. Researchers led by Osaka University and NASA have used a combination of observations and modeling to determine how the planet-hosting probability varies with the distance from the Galactic center. The observations were based on a phenomenon called gravitational microlensing, whereby objects such as planets act as lenses, bending and magnifying the light from distant stars. This effect can be used to detect cold planets similar to Jupiter and Neptune throughout the Milky Way, from the Galactic disk to the Galactic bulge—the central region of our Galaxy. “Gravitational microlensing currently provides the only way to investigate the distribution of planets in the Milky Way,” says Daisuke Suzuki, co-author of the study. “But until now, little is known mainly because of the difficulty in measuring the distance to planets that are more than 10,000 light years from the Sun.” To solve this problem, the researchers instead considered the distribution of a quantity that describes the relative motion of the lens and distant light source in planetary microlensing. By comparing the distribution observed in microlensing events with that predicted by a Galactic model, the research team could infer the Galactic distribution of planets. The results show that the planetary distribution is not strongly dependent on the distance from the Galactic center. Instead, cold planets orbiting far from their stars seem to exist universally in the Milky Way. This includes the Galactic bulge, which has a very different environment to the solar neighborhood, and where the presence of planets has long been uncertain. “Stars in the bulge region are older and are located much closer to each other than stars in the solar neighborhood,” explains lead author of the study Naoki Koshimoto, which was published in . “Our finding that planets reside in both these stellar environments could lead to an improved understanding of how planets form and the history of planet formation in the Milky Way.” According to the researchers, the next step should be to combine these results with measurements of microlens parallax or lens brightness—two other important quantities associated with planetary microlensing.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nasa-osaka-cold-planets-milky-way-research/

"Attempting to save some of the 1.9 million people who die from blood loss every year, researchers at MIT are using barnacles as inspiration to craft a glue that can seal a wound in just 15-seconds. Barnacles are strange old creatures which can glom onto virtually anything in the ocean, whether that’s the smooth metal hull of a ship, the flexible porous skin of a whale, or the craggy surface of a rock. It was drawing inspiration from the barnacles’ oil that the team came up with the potentially-groundbreaking substance. Whether in an operating theater or administration of first aid, rapid blood loss is a hugely frightening situation. Wound adhesives tend not to work well with major injuries. They rely on coagulants which can take minutes to work, time the patient may not have. Furthermore, they rely on dry-enough skin to be able to hold a wound closed; again hardly the ideal conditions when a patient is bleeding heavily, or if you have to close an internal wound. Hyunwoo Yuk, a mechanical engineering scientist at MIT, and his colleagues based their barnacle-inspired glue on the cocktail of lipids (fats) that . This oil they secrete sweeps away contaminants, and primes the surface for glomming onto with a bio-cement that would otherwise not take as well if the surface wasn’t cleared before hand. When secreted onto a cut in the heart of a rat, it stopped the blood-loss and , and proved to withstand 8-times the breaking pressure compared to commercial alternatives. “My overall impression of this material is that it’s incredible,” says Hanjay Wang to , a resident in Stanford University’s Cardiothoracic Surgery Department who was not involved in . “It definitely fills a need, especially in the emergency setting, when you need to just get control.” Another surgeon said she’d never seen anything like it in her career. : There are still some details that must be flushed out, such as how long the bond lasts. Ideally it should last even after the wound has healed on its own, but not forever, and the toxicity levels still need to be carefully calculated. Another physician speaking to Wired about the trials brought up a problem which the glue solves that is simply not being met by any other product in the medical tech market. “With aging populations, you have more and more patients that have either acquired bleeding disorders or are ultimately on blood thinners; the problem of bleeding, and bleeding control is substantial,” Christoph Nabzdyk, a cardiologist and critical care physician from Mayo. : Dr. Yuk has an interesting way of looking at problems, reasoning the animal kingdom’s principal task is survival, so whatever you’re looking to do, heal, or fix, there’s probably an organism that has already solved it. His use of barnacles as inspiration typifies that behavior, and could very well revolutionize the medical field. :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/barnacle-glue-inspired-a-paste-that-can-stop-heavy-bleeding-in-seconds/

You have a poetic license to rebel against conventions that oppress you. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Everyone dreams at least three dreams per night. In a year, your subconscious mind generates over 1,100 dreams. About this remarkable fact, novelist writes, “Dreaming is not merely an act of coded communication. It is also an aesthetic activity, a game that is a value in itself. To dream about things that have not happened is among humanity’s deepest needs.” I bring this to your attention, Scorpio, because September is Honor Your Dreams Month. To celebrate, I suggest the following experiments. 1. Every night before sleep, write down a question you’d like your dreams to respond to. 2. Keep a notebook by your bed and transcribe at least one dream each time you sleep. 3. In the morning, have fun imagining what the previous night’s dreams might be trying to communicate to you. 4. Say prayers of gratitude to your dreams, thanking them for their provocative, entertaining stories. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): In her autobiography , Sagittarian actor expresses grief about how she and a loved one failed to communicate essential truths to each other. I propose we regard her as your anti-role model for the rest of 2021. Use her error as your inspiration. Make emotionally intelligent efforts to talk about unsaid things that linger like ghostly puzzles between you and those you care about. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): “I could do with a bit more excess,” writes author . “From now on I’m going to be immoderate—and volatile,” she vows. “I shall enjoy loud music and lurid poetry. I shall be rampant.” Let me be clear, Capricorn: I’m not urging you to be immoderate, volatile, excessive, and rampant every day for the rest of your long life. But I think you will generate health benefits and good fortune if you experiment with that approach in the coming weeks. Can you think of relatively sane, sensible ways to give yourself this salubrious luxury? AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): While wading through the internet, I found a provocative quote attributed to the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. He supposedly said, “My ultimate goal is to look totally hot, but not be unapproachable.” I confess that in the past I have sometimes been fooled by fake quotes, and this is probably one. Still, it’s amusing to entertain the possibility that such an august personage as Socrates, a major influencer of Western thought, might say something so cute and colloquial. Even if he didn’t say it, I like the idea of blending ancient wisdom with modern insights, seriousness with silliness, thoughtful analysis with good fun. In accordance with astrological omens, I recommend you experiment with comparable hybrids in the coming weeks. (PS: One of your goals should be to look totally hot, but not be unapproachable.) PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): “If you don’t know what you want,” writes Piscean novelist , “you end up with a lot you don’t.” Very true! And right now, it’s extra important to keep that in mind. During the coming weeks, you’ll be at the peak of your ability to attract what you want and need. Wouldn’t you prefer to gather influences you really desire—as opposed to those for which you have mild or zero interest? Define your wants and needs very precisely. ARIES (March 21-April 19): Aries poet wrote, “I’ve learned to value failed conversations, missed connections, confusions. What remains is what’s unsaid, what’s underneath. Understanding on another level of being.” In the coming weeks, I suggest you adopt her perspective as you evaluate both past and present experiences. You’re likely to find small treasures in what you’d assumed were wastelands. You may uncover inspiring clues in plot twists that initially frustrated you. Upon further examination, interludes you dismissed as unimportant or uninteresting could reveal valuable wrinkles. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): After studying your astrological omens, I’ve decided to offer you inspiration from the ancient Roman poet Catullus. I hope the extravagant spirit of his words will free you to be greedy for the delights of love and affection. wrote, “Give me a thousand kisses, then a hundred; then another thousand, then a second hundred; then yet another thousand.” I’ll add the following to Catullus’s appeal: Seek an abundance of endearing words, sweet favors and gifts, caresses and massages, and help with your work. If there’s no one in your life to provide you with such blessings, give them to yourself. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Gemini author writes that the Old Uzbek language was rich in expressions about crying. There were “words for wanting to cry and not being able to, for loudly crying like thunder in the clouds, for crying in gasps, for weeping inwardly or secretly, for crying ceaselessly in a high voice, for crying in hiccups, and for crying while uttering the sound ‘hay hay.'” I recommend all of these to you in the coming days, as well as others you might dream up. Why? It’s prime time to seek the invigorating release and renewal that come from shedding tears generated by deep and mysterious feelings. CANCER (June 21-July 22): A blogger named MythWoven imagines an “alternate universe where I literally go to school forever (for free) so I can learn about art and literature and history and languages for 100 years. No job skills. No credit requirements. No student loans. Just learning.” I have longings like hers. There’s an eternal student within me that wants to be endlessly surprised with exciting information about interesting subjects. I would love to be continually adding fresh skills and aptitudes to my repertoire. In the coming weeks, I will give free rein to that part of me. I recommend you do the same, my fellow Cancerian. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): In 2016, the International Garden Photograph of the Year depicted lush lupine flowers in New Zealand. The sea of tall purple, pink, and blue blooms was praised as “an elegant symphony” and “a joy to behold.” What the judges didn’t mention is that lupine is an invasive species in New Zealand. It forces native plant species out of their habitat, which in turn drives away native animal species, including birds like the wrybill, black stilt, and banded dotterel. Is there a metaphorically comparable phenomenon in your life, Leo? Problematic beauty? Some influence that’s both attractive and prickly? A wonderful thing that can also be troublesome? The coming weeks will be a favorable time to try to heal the predicament.

In her grunge flannel shirt, the 11-year-old drummer took the stage at the Los Angeles Forum to finally meet her rock star idol in person—and play alongside Dave Grohl and his world-renown Foo Fighters. Nandi accepted the invitation and traveled with her parents from Ipswich, England, where she’s been playing since she was five-years-old. It was a bright spot during the pandemic in August 2020 when she made a video challenging Grohl to an . Her drumming is so superlative that multiple friends of the former Nirvana drummer were texting him, saying he had to respond with a video of his own. Over several weeks they went back and forth with dueling videos, and in September, Grohl, a Grammy Award-winning singer, drummer and guitarist, , the wunderkind who also plays guitar and bass. (The video is incredible, with Dave’s daughters, hereby known as “the Grohlettes,” .) On August 26, near the end of the California show, Dave introduced the girl who had initiated their drum-off by playing her cover version of the Foo Fighters hit . Now it was time to join the big boys playing that song for the encore. The crowd began chanting ‘Nandi. Nandi. Nandi.’ “It was EPIC!!!,” she wrote on her Twitter page. It happened!!! It was !!!

"Truly astonishing behavior has just been recorded in a pair of wild Goffin’s Cockatoos, who like expert bandits, manufactured an entire three-piece set of tools to burgle their way into the pit of a mango. Caught wild and held for a short time in a research aviary in Indonesia, it is the kind of behavior that typifies the most advanced tool users in the animal kingdom, and solidifies the Goffin’s Cockatoo as one of the avian group’s major bird-brainiacs. Perhaps the most delightful part of this discovery was that it happened serendipitously, while Mark O’Hara and Berenika Mioduszewska were studying a new group of wild birds in their “I’d just turned away, and when I looked back, one of the birds was making and using tools,” O’Hara, of the Messerli Research Institute in Vienna Austria, tells . “I couldn’t believe my eyes!” Before the capture of the canny cockatoos, O’Hara and Mioduszewska had spent an eye-watering 900 hours watching them feed high in the canopy without ever once witnessing tool use. A few other bird species, like the New Caledonian Crow and Hyacinth Macaw, have been documented making stick tools, and even hook tools. Goffin’s Cockatoos are well-documented as intuitive social learners that can . The Messerli Institute has, in fact, shown how one individual was able to That, however, was just one tool, for one purpose. This new observation is the first time any bird species has been seen creating and using a set of tools in a specific order : While researching the cockatoos, the team would regularly provide them with food they found about the island, including the wawai, or sea mango, which is poisonous to humans but nutritious for birds. At the center of the mango a hard pit protects a large, nutritious seed. For awhile it seemed there was nothing special about the bunch of birds they captured, but two individuals, upon getting their talons onto the pits, began to craft not one, not two, but a set of three different tools to work their way into the fruit pit. “Repeated provisions of the fruit allowed us to analyze the behavior in detail, and to collect and trace some of the manufactured tools,” explains O’Hara in a video abstract. “Using a structure-from-motion technique we could create 3D models and gather detailed measurements such as size and volume…[of the tools used]. Based on the physical properties, the function analysis classified three types of tools; we discovered that each tool type seemed to serve a different purpose.” : With a thicker section of branch, they would use their beak to push and pry open one end of the pit, while with a second, medium-fine implement, they punctured the membrane surrounding the seed. Lastly, they would make a scoop-like tool which when maneuvered with their mouth, allowed them to extract the seed material. This making of tool sets has been seen in humans, chimpanzees, and capuchin monkeys; full stop. Chimps use between two and five tools for termite and beehive raids. Tool use has been proposed in the parrot lineage as having a strong captivity bias, so whether the behavior was tied to their stay in the aviary or whether they use tools in the wild is something O’Hara and Mioduszewska discuss in their “If they had a genetic predisposition to use tools, all the birds would do it,” O’Hara tells Science. “Since only a few make these, it’s more likely they invented them independently,” which would be even more likely as the two individuals displayed immediate and exceptional proficiency. : They believe that it is not species-wide but acquired by individuals through opportunistic innovations, or by watching and learning from others. A number of intriguing details emerge in the Discussion section, such as that tools tended to be crafted to specifications before use, rather than through a trial-and-error process. Another detail is that around the island they had found fruit underneath wawai trees that appeared to had been foraged on with tools. One actually contained a wooden fragment inserted into the fissure of the pit, which provided enough years go by, could be the first-ever instance of “avian-archaeology.” : O’Hara and Mioduszewska’s paper is filled with videos that are stunning to watch, and can be .",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cockatoos-first-ever-bird-to-make-and-use-tool-sets/
"Another hurricane, another power outage? In the state of Louisiana, one apartment complex is keeping the lights on—a beacon of hope in New Orleans. St. Peter Residential, which opened one month before the pandemic began, built in that emergency functionality using an 8-hour solar battery and a panel array on its roof—and it kept the units running after Hurricane Ida made landfall. At $7.4 million, the 45,000 square foot building is the first net-zero emission apartment complex in the state, meaning it offsets or removes as much power as it generates onsite. Designed as “a calming oasis intent on building community in a dense urban environment,” the 50-unit, mixed-income living spaces are served by a microgrid of 450 solar panels that generate electricity on demand, and stored excess power in a battery located in the parking lot. St. Peter was designed to cultivate a community (with the inclusion of a wellness center for yoga and meditation and common event and outdoor spaces), and importantly, half of the 50 units—29 affordable apartments and 21 market-rate units—are reserved for veterans. The microgrid has now seen three storms: Hurricane Zeta which took out power in the area last October, Winter Storm Uri which resulted in the same thing, and now Hurricane Ida. Lauren Avioli is the director of housing development for the nonprofit SBP, which oversaw the funding and construction of St. Peter. SBP, named after St. Bernard Project, was founded by Zack Rosenburg and Liz McCartney after the couple (now married) volunteered in the St. Bernard parish following the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina. Since then, SBP has rebuilt homes for more than 2,000 families and hired as the architect to design this innovative complex that provides residents with extremely low energy bills. : “It’s not just post-disaster emergency power,” Avioli told . “It’s also helping people at the property save money on a blue sky day because we can use some of the energy that’s being generated by the solar panels to run the building.” It doesn’t work all the time, however. For example, on Tuesday when the power went off it was cloudy, and the system couldn’t deliver as much electricity as the building managers would have hoped for. But the days after were sunny and powerless in New Orleans, except for , many of whom have transitioned from lower-income housing, or even from homelessness. believes it’s a no-brainer as far as city planning goes, to place these resilient solar microgrids on as many rooftops as possible—especially if, as some scientists’ believe, global climate change is making storms like Ida hit harder and more often than normal. Cities would not only be doing their best to keep the power on, but to mitigate their share of emissions going up into the atmosphere. : The St. Peter project is a shining example of how developers and cities can commit to helping find solutions to eradicating both poverty and climate change emissions that are exacerbating such storms.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/solar-powered-apartment-in-new-orleans-kept-the-lights-on-through-ida/
"We all know 2020 was a rough year and many people turned to thinking about what they could do to improve the situation for themselves or for others. One of those people was Kimberly Wybenga. She wanted to brighten the outlook for friends and family and wondered ‘who doesn’t love a compliment’? She bought 10 small jars and wrote out compliments for 10 friends that she thought could use a dose of happiness. Just writing out the compliments brought her joy and she bought 20 more jars to spread the love even further. She didn’t stop there, either. She bought an additional 20 jars bringing the total number of kindness gift jars to 50—and did it all anonymously. Altogether, she hand-wrote 1,750 compliments! ( ) One recipient commented, “Sometimes the universe knows exactly what you need. This touched me to the core. The thoughtfulness that went into this is amazing.” Another said, “I hope whoever did give this to me realizes just how much I needed this gift. I’ve opened it and read one when I needed it, but tonight I dumped it all out and read every single nice thing this person said about me.” : “I know everyone is dealing with some kind of struggle and I just thought it would be nice to support them any way I could,” Wybenga told GNN, “even if I didn’t know what they were going through.” The 38 year-old tried to deliver her boxes of hope anonymously, signing “a friend” at the bottom of each card. She mailed some packages and hand-delivered others that lived closer to her home in Colorado. The ones that she hand-delivered, she even tried to disguise herself so if people had cameras, they wouldn’t know it was her. Dressed in a black jacket, her long blue hair pulled up into a beanie, and a mask, she placed the boxes on doorsteps. She even parked around corners or down streets so people wouldn’t see her car. : All the effort to remain anonymous didn’t work much of the time because Wybenga’s handwriting was recognized by multiple people. Others looked up her zip code on the package or did some sleuthing and discovered it was her. “Seeing other people happy brought me so much joy,” she said. “The world is a better place with all my friends and family.” She decided to now share the story publicly, in the hope that it would inspire someone else to spread kindness.

"Four commercially-fished tuna species are on a significant path to recovery thanks to the enforcement of regional fishing regulations over the last ten years, according to yesterday’s update of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. “Today’s IUCN Red List update is a powerful sign that, despite increasing pressures on our oceans, species can recover if states truly commit to sustainable practices,” said Dr Bruno Oberle, IUCN Director General. States and others are now gathered at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Marseille, France, to work towards binding targets that will increase and maintain biodiversity across the planet. “The newly released results on the status of commercial tunas emphasize that sustainable fisheries are possible,” said Dr Beth Polidoro, Associate Professor at Arizona State University and Red List coordinator. : In the Red List update, the seven most commercially fished tuna species were reassessed. Four moved in a positive direction thanks to countries enforcing more sustainable fishing quotas and successfully combatting illegal fishing: “The take home message for the general public is that things like albacore tuna—which is the one that is widely on supermarket shelves—is of least concern now,” Craig Hilton-Taylor, who heads the Red List, told BBC News. “It means that what they’re eating has been sustainably caught and is well managed.” : Despite global improvement at the species level, some regional tuna stocks remain depleted. For example, while the larger, eastern population of Atlantic bluefin tuna, which originates in the Mediterranean, has increased by at least 22% over the last four decades, the species’ smaller native western Atlantic population, which spawns in the Gulf of Mexico, has declined by more than half in the same period. “These Red List assessments are proof that sustainable fisheries approaches work, with enormous long-term benefits for livelihoods and biodiversity,” said Dr Bruce Collette, Chair of the IUCN SSC Tuna and Billfish Group. “Tuna species migrate across thousands of kilometers, so coordinating their management globally is also key.” :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/iucn-reports-4-tuna-species-on-path-to-recovery/

"“’Till death do us part,” obviously doesn’t translate into ancient Mandarin, if this archaeological discovery in China is any indication. The skeletal remains of a couple locked in a tender embrace bears witness to the fact that in the Northern Wei Period of 4th century China, the expectation of love was that it went, quite literally, beyond the grave. The lovers lay on their side, arms wrapped around each other’s waist, with the woman’s cheek nestled in the crook of the man’s shoulder. Barring any phenomenal circumstances, archaeologists believe that the two were placed into their gravesite in this manner, reflecting “the desire for eternal love of the couple, and the respect to their love by people who buried them”. As the reports, the scene might conjure the end of the tragic tale of . With obvious signs of trauma across the male’s body, including an unhealed wound on his right arm, and a wound-less female skeleton, the archaeologists suggest the possibility that she ended her own life in a kind of sacrifice in order to be with her lover in the afterlife. The discovery was made as part of an excavation that unearthed a cemetery in the city of Dadong, and the orientation of the grave suggests it was used by commoners. : Another striking detail was the presence of a silver ring on the female’s finger—but the researchers don’t believe it had anything to do with marriage. They think it was simply the cultures’ tendencies to think of “bringing things” with them, into the afterlife. The lack of gems or engravings meant “it probably didn’t cost very much.” This Northern Wei period in an abrasive relationship, like sandpaper, with the many nomadic tribes on their borders. The nomads, in this case the Tuobo People, conquered Shanxi, in the Taiyuan Province. Subsequent rulers cultivated Buddhism as a strong central faith, bringing a more concrete concept of the afterlife to the people. : “This funerary practice might have been influenced by the customs from the Western Regions and beyond through the Silk Roads,” write the authors in their corresponding on the discovery. “This discovery is a unique display of the human emotion of love in a burial, offering a rare glimpse of concepts of love, life, death and the afterlife in northern China during a time of intense cultural and ethnic exchange,” said co-author Qu Zhang.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/skeletons-in-china-found-locked-in-loving-embrace-in-the-same-grave/
"Clinical trials of a new precision, or functional medicine approach to targeting and reversing cognitive decline from Alzheimer’s has produced “unprecedented” and “far-reaching” results. Called the MEND (metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration) Protocol, it’s based on the oft-ignored, though universally understood preference, going all the way back to Hippocrates, for treating the cause—not the symptom—of a disease. Developed by , an internationally renowned expert in neurodegenerative disease, it works to fix and fortify the underlying biochemical profile that gives rise to Alzheimer’s, rather than simply targeting, as pharmaceutical companies have tried to do, the tau protein called beta-amyloid that brings about the hallmarks of the disease. Neuroscientists have firmly established as the only natural defense mechanism we have to protect our brain from the toxic beta-amyloid proteins that cause Alzheimer’s, but Bredesen has now shown in a series of human clinical trials that there is a panoply of conditions that must be met in order for a human to develop Alzheimer’s, and that if these conditions are corrected, even in the elderly, dementia can be reversed. In the Dr. Bredesen explained that 10 patients with mild or subjective-cognitive impairment—what Bredesen describes as essentially the first two of a four-stage disease—underwent 5-24 weeks of the MEND Protocol. “The therapeutic approach used was programmatic and personalized,” writes Bredesen. “Patients who had had to discontinue work were able to return to work, and those struggling at work were able to improve their performance. The patients, their spouses, and their co-workers all reported clear improvements.” The time for science jargon must end, Bredesen stressed in a recent interview on , because for patients struggling with Alzheimer’s, and for their families, it is a tragedy that can’t be adequately summarized in the language of a peer-reviewed paper. Anecdotal evidence may be enough to warrant action. One of the ten patients, aged 69, was advised that, given his status as an Alzheimer’s disease patient and his clear decline, he should begin to “get his affairs in order.” His business was in the process of being shut down due to his inability to continue work. He began on the MEND therapeutic program, and after six months, he and his wife and co-workers all noted the improvement. He was able to recognize faces at work unlike before, was able to remember his daily schedule, and was able to function at work without difficulty. He was also noted to be quicker with his responses. His lifelong ability to add columns of numbers rapidly in his head, which he had lost during his progressive cognitive decline, returned. His wife pointed out that, although he had clearly shown improvement, the more striking effect was that he had been accelerating in his decline over the prior year or two, and this had been completely halted. MEND case studies were complied detailing people recovering from the neurodegeneration—not slowing, or stopping their cognitive decline, but of altogether reversing it. The 2018 case study is filled with small notations that highlight the significance to the patient and their family. “Driver’s license returned…follows recipes again…speaking, dressing, dancing, biking, emailing, kayaking all returned…conversing again, dressing himself, calling grandchildren by name, working again.” One nurse asked, “What happened?!” From this method came the “Bredesen Protocol,” which recently produced the first clinical trial in history that involved a pre-examination for all the underlying factors that contribute to Alzheimer’s, before setting patients on a personalized, precision medicine approach. Released on a pre-print server for studies awaiting peer-review, that what we call Alzheimer’s is a network dysfunction resulting from decades of assaults upon our physiology by the environment. Toxins like heavy metals, black mold, and air particulates, metabolites and biological detritus like the beta-amyloid targeted by dementia drugs, a lack of neuro-fortification arising from a sedentary lifestyle of the body and mind—all of these contribute to the conditions that give rise to neurodegeneration. Logically it would follow that correcting this dysfunction would be the first step to targeting Alzheimer’s. And, that is exactly what happened in all 25 of the patients in the study, when they were assisted in addressing all 36 underlying biological dimensions in the Protocol. While this is merely a news report, and is not to be construed as medical advice, those interested in the Bredesen Protocol .

He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): “I sing like the nightingale whose melody is crowded in the too narrow passage of her throat,” wrote author Virginia Woolf. That was an insulting curse for her to fling at herself. I disapprove of such behavior—especially for you in the coming weeks. If you hope to be in alignment with cosmic rhythms, don’t you dare say nasty things about yourself, even in the privacy of your own thoughts. In fact, please focus on the exact opposite: flinging praise and appreciation and compliments at yourself. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): The Tumblr blogger wlw says the following are the top tender actions. 1. Fastening clothes or jewelry for your companion. 2. Letting them rest their head on your shoulder. 3. Idly playing with their hands. 4. Brushing a leaf out of their hair. 5. Locking pinkies. 6. Rubbing their back when you embrace. 7. Both of you wearing an item that belongs to the other. Dear Libra, I hope you will employ these tender actions with greater frequency than usual in the coming weeks, Libra. Why? In my astrological opinion, it’s a ripe time to boost your Affection Quotient with the allies you care for the most. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Naturalist wrote in his journal, “I feel slightly complimented when nature condescends to make use of me without my knowledge—as when I help scatter her seeds in my walk—or carry burs and cockles on my clothes from field to field. I feel as though I had done something for the commonweal.” I mention this, Scorpio, because the coming weeks will be an excellent time for you to carry out good deeds and helpful transformations in nature’s behalf. Your ability to collaborate benevolently with plants and animals and elemental forces will be at a peak. So will your knack for creating interesting connections between yourself and all wild things. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): You may have never heard of Sagittarian artist Baya Mahieddine (1931–1998). At age 16, she experienced a splash of acclaim with a show in Paris. Famous artists Pablo Picasso, Henry Matisse, and George Braques came. They drew inspiration from Mahieddine’s innovative use of color, elements from her Algerian heritage, and her dream-like images. Picasso even invited her to work with him, exulting in the fresh perspectives she ignited. Though her art never received the full credit it warranted,  astrological omens are authorizing you to go out and get the recognition and appreciation you deserve but have not yet fully received. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): “Who knows what is unfolding on the other side of each hour?” asked Capricorn poet Juan Ramón Jiménez (translated by Capricorn poet Robert Bly). “How many times the sunrise was there, behind a mountain. How many times the brilliant cloud piling up far off was already a golden body full of thunder!” Your assignment, Capricorn, is to imagine what is unfolding just beyond your perception and understanding. But here’s the twist: You must steer your mind away from inclinations to indulge in fear. You must imagine that the events in the works are beautiful, interesting, or redemptive. If you’re not willing to do that, skip the exercise altogether. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): “Better than any argument is to rise at dawn and pick dew-wet red berries in a cup,” wrote author Wendell Berry. I mostly agree with that sentiment, although I will also put in a good word for certain kinds of arguments. There are moments when it’s crucial for your psychological and spiritual health that you initiate a conversation about delicate issues that might lead to a dispute. However, I don’t think this is one of those times, Aquarius. In my astrological opinion, picking dew-wet red berries is far more sensible than any argument. For further inspiration, read this testimony from actor : “I definitely would rather take a nap than get angry.” PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): For painter , love wasn’t primarily a sentimental feeling. Nor was it an unfocused generalized wish for health and happiness in those he cared for. Rather, he wrote, “You must love with a high, serious, intimate sympathy, with a will, with intelligence.” His love was alert, acute, active, and energized. It was animated with a determination to be resourceful and ingenious in nurturing the beloved. For van Gogh, love was always in action, forever moving toward ever-fresh engagement. In service to intimacy, he said, “you must always seek to know more thoroughly, better, and more.” I hope you’ll make these meditations a top priority during the next seven weeks. ARIES (March 21-April 19): Aries mythologist advised us to love our fate. He said we should tell ourselves, “Whatever my fate is, this is what I need.” Even if an event seems inconvenient or disruptive, we treat it as an opportunity, as an interesting challenge. “If you bring love to that moment, not discouragement,” Campbell said, “you will find the strength.” He concludes that any detour or disarray you can learn from “is an improvement in your character, your stature, and your life. What a privilege!” Few signs of the zodiac are inclined to enthusiastically adopt such an approach, but you Aries folks are most likely to do so. Now is an especially favorable time to use it. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): The brilliant Taurus dancer and choreographer spoke of “a vitality, a life force, a quickening that is translated through you into action,” adding that “there is only one of you in all time.” She added, “It is not your business to determine how good it is, nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open.” But even if you do this very well, Graham said, you will nevertheless always feel “a divine dissatisfaction, a blessed unrest” that will fuel you. This is the perfect message for you Tauruses to embrace in the coming weeks. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): There’s growing scientific evidence that we make ourselves stupid by complaining too much—or even by listening to other people complain a lot. Excessive negative thoughts drain energy from our hippocampus, a part of our brain that’s essential to problem-solving. This doesn’t mean, of course, that we should avoid dealing with difficult issues. But it does suggest we should be discerning about how many disturbing and depressing ideas we entertain. According to my reading of the omens, all this will be especially useful advice for you in the coming weeks. CANCER (June 21-July 22): Your brain contains one hundred billion nerve cells. Each cell has the potential to be linked with tens of thousands of others. And they are always busy. Typically, your grey matter makes a million new connections every second. But I suspect your number of connections will increase even beyond that in the coming weeks. Your most complex organ will be working with greater intensity than usual. Will that be a bad thing or a good thing? It depends on whether you formulate an intention to channel your intelligence into wise analysis about important matters—and not waste it in careless fussing about trivial details. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): “You should have a sticky soul,” counsels author Elizabeth Berg. “The act of continually taking things in should be as much a part of you as your hair color.” I especially endorse that attitude for you during the next four weeks, Leo. Your task is to make yourself extra magnetic for all the perceptions, experiences, ideas, connections, and resources you need most. By September 23, I suspect you will have gained an infusion of extra ballast and gravitas.

"Even a T-bone steak could not have persuaded this determined dog to move a muscle. The family pet named River was adopted from a shelter, so her breed is a mystery. It is believed, however, that she is part Australian Shepherd—and may be part border collie—so it’s not surprising that she is craftier than the average pup. When it gets late and bedtime is approaching, River gets her instruction to go out for her nightly toilet duties. Normally, she doesn’t mind and trots obediently out the door to visit the grass and trees on the property, and returns a few minutes later to settle in for the night. But she doesn’t like the rain at all, and on this night she devised a scheme to avoid going out into the weather. When she’s told to go outside, she rolled over on her back and pretended to be dead, or sleeping, or in a coma—but lying completely still. River wouldn’t budge for anything. : Her owner even tried flattery, but in the end, he just shoved her across the shiny floor towards the door, to her dismay. the video for a guaranteed chuckle, as River feigns paralysis to avoid going out in the rain…",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/dog-fakes-coma-to-avoid-going-outside/
"More than half of moms use snack time to show off what a “cool” mom they are, a new poll finds. The recent survey asked 2,000 American moms with children ages 3–18 to identify the traits of a “cool” mom—and then asked their kids to set the record straight. Nearly three in five kids agreed that a “cool” mom helps them out with homework and projects for school. And, according to kids, there are some things a “cool” mom should never do. Using their home nickname in front of their friends (42%), shouting their name at a sports game or other event (40%), and dancing in public (40%), will put some parents in time-out. Conducted by OnePoll in partnership with , the survey suggests that although getting kids to eat healthy food can be a challenge, moms have a few tricks up their sleeves, such as cutting up fruits and vegetables into fun shapes (48%) and making their food more colorful (47%). 47% of moms worry about whether their kids think they’re cool, and making food fun is one of their top creative ploys to win kids over. Half of moms have made a cheese board for their children, and more than half admitted that their youngsters eat more sophisticated snacks and lunches than they do. Moms also shared the secrets behind their greatest ever snack hacks, including blending frozen fruit so kids think it’s ice cream, building a stackable tower with sticks of watermelon and even making sandwich kabobs. Snacks and lunches can be a bragging point for kids, too—especially those that include chips (50%), baked goods (44%) or a fruit bowls (44%). : “Our study shows that many moms are good at navigating that balance between giving kids the foods they enjoy and making sure they’re getting a balanced diet,” said a spokesperson for SUNSET. “They’re introducing their youngsters to fruits and veggies in creative ways and incorporating them not just at lunchtime, but throughout the day as well.” And it can be a great opportunity for parents and kids to bond. Take a look at some of these cool-mom tips… • Kiwi caterpillars • Blending frozen fruit so they think it’s ice cream • Freezing bone broth in small cubes for winter soups or drinks • Making grab bags that they can’t see inside of and letting them choose their own bags, so every snack is a surprise • Sandwich kabobs • Making squash look and taste almost like mac n’ cheese to trick her into eating a veggie she doesn’t like • Jello with fruit mixed in and then poured into cool molds in different kinds of shapes like cars, houses, bears, etc. • Making pumpkin pancakes with beets and other pureed vegetables, but with fun colors • Building a Jenga stack with watermelon • Playing ‘restaurant’ during lunch – using menus so they can choose • Saying something is a ‘grown-up version’ so they want it, or something ‘new’ they get excited to try :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/snack-time-hacks-make-you-a-cool-mom/
"Noted researchers are coming together on September 10 to spread one message: “Self-compassion is critical.” The will feature a deep dive into self-compassion with Kristin Neff, PhD, the pioneering self-compassion researcher who conducted the first empirical studies on self-compassion over 20 years ago. Her latest book is The free event has been organized by the , which wants to focus us inward. “It is not just the external systems that require compassionate care, it is each and every one of us who can benefit from the inner work of self-compassion to rest, restore, and return to wholeness.” The gathering will be co-hosted by the Center’s founder Laura Berland,  and Monica Worline, PhD, co-author of and researcher with the Stanford University Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education. Berland points out that self-compassion is often an overlooked concept. “Self-compassion is the foundation for our internal growth, a greater capacity for compassion with others, and creating the compassionate world where everyone thrives.” “Especially during these chaotic times, the call to compassionate action is more urgent than ever,” she added : Worline and Neff, an Associate Professor of Educational Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, will share their latest research and insights on self-compassion. The free 75-minute event will also provide virtual rooms for participants to practice and to engage in small group conversations with like-minded compassion advocates from around the world. : LEARN more and register for the Zoom event .",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/researchers-to-explain-importance-of-self-compassion/
"This artist creates intricate sculptures of animals made completely out of trash including plastic spoons, old ping pong balls, and even unused catheters. 35-year-old Stephanie Hongo embraced trash art four years ago because at the time she could not afford art supplies. Now Stephanie, who lives in Connecticut, has created over 100 detailed artworks of animals, sometimes screwing together hundreds of pieces of trash for one piece. Stephanie appeals to friends and family for spare trash and also sources specific pieces from Facebook groups to complete her incredible sculptures of lobsters, octopus, and other animals. She has used a Barbie leg to create a unicorn’s horn, unused catheters as the antennas of a lobster, and plastic forks for the feathers of an owl. Stephanie, who creates her art under the name Sugarfox, explained that she turned to trash to make her artworks as she was strapped for cash after quitting her job as an artist-in-residence at grocery store chain Trader Joe’s in May 2017. She was inspired by Portuguese artist Bordalo II, who makes large scale installations out of trash. She made a rule that she will never purchase plastics for her sculptures. “I won’t ever purchase plastic, I don’t like the idea of buying anything outside the paint and the hardware that I need,” She said. “I do ask for plastic tubing or old basketballs on community pages on Facebook. Despite using recycled materials, Stephanie resists the label of ‘eco artist’ as she uses spray paint to complete her pieces. “I do find it necessary to tell people that I’m not an eco artist. The recycling aspect of my art is something I’m very proud of but it’s not the driving force behind it. The animal kingdom is Stephanie’s favorite subject and she likes how nailing trash together gives the works a sci-fi, steampunk look. She spends between ten hours and two weeks on each piece and has developed a knack for finding the perfect piece of trash to build her artworks. “Some pieces need hundreds of pieces of trash. “Ping pong balls are very commonly used in my art as well as a lot of extension cords, old telephones, old remote controls, and lots of plastic toys.” Stephanie, who shows off her artworks on her Instagram , said that her artworks start at $300 with her eight-foot long octopus going for $5,000. She hopes to one day sculpt a winged dragon measuring ten feet.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/animal-sculptures-trash-art-stephanie-hongo/
"While in America off-grid solar electricity is still fairly uncommon, around the world it gives power to 420 million people. Furthermore, it’s created an entirely unlooked-for market worth more than $1 billion annually. It’s unlooked-for because—as the first and even second generations of solar panels are nearing the end of their lifecycle—renewable energy pioneers and advocates are hurrying to try and come up with ways to prevent them from inundating landfills with millions of tons of electronic waste. The International Renewable Energy Agency that, by 2050, there will be only slightly more new panels installed per year than there will be panels being decommissioned—and they are predicted to grow to 6% of global electronic waste streams. The solution to the problem of growing solar waste, is perhaps seeing that a degraded solar panel just needs a slight fix to make it nearly as good as new. Since 2017, revenues from the off-grid solar industry continue to rapidly grow, increasing by 30% annually, , who add that 180 million off-grid solar panels were sold to people in countries including Nigeria, Pakistan, and Lebanon. In nations such as these, reliable power for those outside the major cities is hardly the norm. Poor infrastructure and limited investment currently restricts electricity access to about one-ninth of the world’s population. While perhaps not good enough to maintain government or industry-imposed standards for power generation at a Google campus, decommissioned solar panels are often just fine for meeting the needs of powering a house, or a water pump, or something equally small. A little opinion piece in remarking on these recent reports noted that second-hand market shipments of retired solar panels in the several thousands are quite the normal. In the Southern Hemisphere, merely an $11 billion investment at current market conditions would be needed to expand the second-hand solar trade to every unpowered inhabitant. “The off-grid solar industry is instrumental for achieving universal electricity access,” said Riccardo Puliti of the report, the Regional Director of Infrastructure, Africa, at the World Bank. “We are scaling up our support to client countries by helping them leverage this potential through innovative and financially sustainable solutions.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-second-hand-market-for-solar-panels-could-be-a-market-solution-for-power-access/
"A year ago this month, former President Trump signed into law the Great American Outdoors Act, one of the largest votes of support for U.S. public lands system since it was conceived. Now over 250 projects have already gotten underway in 40 states across America. Passing with massive bipartisan support, the bill permanently authorized the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), a critical source of funding for public land maintenance, with $900 million in annual spending for parks, forests, lakeshores, campgrounds, roads and other infrastructure, down to the smallest playgrounds in your local neighborhood. In Shoshone National Forest, a dilapidated bridge has been ; a scenic byway and drain culvert will be replaced in National Forests such as Daniel Boone, Ozark St. Francis, El Yunque, George Washington-Jefferson, and all those in Florida and North Carolina, new roads, wastewater treatment systems, campgrounds, trail restoration, bridges, and much more. Devil’s Canyon campground on the Manti-La Sal National Forest received brand spanking new roads. Montana got a hefty share of the $285 million war chest that was part of the first round of LWCF dollars distributed among 40 states to address 54 projects spectacular wild places such as the Bitterroot Mountain Range. $11 million for campground restoration, and another $4 million went to an unspecified Utah project across 50 acres.

"There may be a thousand ways to say, ‘Happy Birthday!’ but the sweetest of all may very well be a special chocolate message that was recently served up by an amazingly thoughtful restaurant staff. Creating natal felicitations in warm liquid cocoa was nothing new at London’s Luciano by Gino D’Acampo restaurant, but for birthday girl Natalie Te Paa, who is totally blind, the best wishes were spelled out in Braille. What gave the message an even greater meaning was that there was no advance planning involved. When the restaurant crew learned the dinner Te Paa was sharing with friend Claire Sara was a birthday celebration, they took it upon themselves to find and recreate the Braille translation that summed up their best wishes in well-chilled chocolate. Te Paa could barely believe her fingertips as she traced over the raised confectionary dots. “My mind was blank for a second and then I was like, ‘Is this in Braille?’” Ta Paa told . “I’ve never had anything happen like that before. It was wild. They just really did go above and beyond.” Dinner companion Sara recorded Te Paa’s delighted reaction to what had become a very different kind of surprise party and posted the jubilant footage to TikTok. I’ll never forget this moment. While restaurant manager Giovanni Galluccio maintains the impromptu gesture was simply part of the customer service they strive to extend to all their patrons, clocking in with close to 16 million views to date, the internet judged the extraordinary act of kindness extra special. As Te Paa told TODAY, “The fact that people have responded so much and so well to it just shows how much the world needs kindness right now, how much the world needs a message of hope, needs to see people doing things and going above and beyond for each other.” “So take heart despite how broken the world is right now,” the viral video caption reads, “true kindness still exists.” To paraphrase M&M’s iconic tagline—that’s one message sure to “melt in your hearts, not in your hands.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/restaurant-braille-chocolate-cake-natalie-te-paa/
"Of course, the commentary of wise figures from would be relevant for every day and every moment, such is the power of J.R.R. Tolkien’s writings. While Tolkien vehemently rejected that his fantasy masterpiece represented anything allegorical whatsoever, one might say that it has launched itself forward to stand among the principle allegories of our time. I recently took to trilogy books once again, as my lack of television has barred me from watching the films for two-and-a-half years, and I couldn’t help but measure everything I’ve seen since COVID-19 arrived to the circumstances of Tolkien and of his chief protagonist Frodo Baggins. In the edition I read (which was not the edition my brother and I owned when we were young), a detailed foreword written by the author explained how the book came to be when he took up his pen in the waxing years of the turmoil that would become World War II. In it I found something which Gandalf the Grey might describe as “an encouraging thought,” a feeling that struck me again as I read the innocence in Frodo’s voice as he realizes he must leave his home forever on a perilous quest from which he likely would never return. Today, with warnings of waning immunity, fourth waves, and more, I thought an interview with Frodo, Gandalf, and their creator might make for a strong lesson in changing times, and our attitudes towards them. The best stories are the ones which are told the best, with all those wonderful literary keystones fitted neatly together. They are the ones we learn of in creative writing: can we see ourselves in the characters, are they flawed, do they make the right choice or the easy one, can we relate to their difficulties? Tolkien and his characters reflect, whether he would like them to or not, how the times during which one lives tend to vacuum them up, obscuring thoughts of the future or of the past. COVID-19 has been compared to many great crises, sometimes fairly, sometimes comedically, but we can learn from the great writer and his characters that the correct way out of a crisis is to never believe the current disaster is somehow unique in its dreadfulness. Tolkien became a man in perhaps the worst single moment in history to do so, around 1914, at the dawning of World War I. “In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly,” he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher later in life. “It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.” He was a junior officer at the Battle of the Somme, one of the most tragic events in human history, notable for the sheer empty-headedness of it all. Catching trench fever, he was shipped back to England, after which nearly every young man in his battalion was killed. Talk about a Hobbit’s luck. The Great War, described at the time as the “war to end all wars” was a singularity. Yet, as unbelievably calamitous as it had proved, twenty years later a new generation was set to do it all again. “One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years,” Tolkien writes in his foreword. He had not finished writing his iconic fantasy books upon the outbreak of the second ‘great war’ in 1939—and had not even finished the first part of the first book. “In spite of the darkness of the next five years I found that the story could not now wholly be abandoned and I plodded on, mostly by night,” he recalled. His son was serving in the British Royal Air Force, a difficult situation for any parent. Thank goodness you plodded on sir, thank goodness. Now we come to Frodo. Like the hobbit, so many of us in March of 2020 suddenly had our collective “Shires” clouded over. News coming out of Italy, China, and a cruise ship off the coast of Washington had placed the Ring of Power atop all our mantlepieces. A long, hard journey lay ahead. Among Frodo’s seminal strengths is one which shines during his encounter with the dark portents which Gandalf brings to him—that he must leave the Shire behind, perhaps forever. Rather than giving up or refusing to get involved, or feeling there may be no time for futures, he simply gets on with it, despite the fact that he admits he is very scared. “But this [the adventure] would mean exile, a flight from danger into danger, drawing it after me. And I suppose I must go alone, if I am to do that and save the Shire. But I feel very small, and very uprooted, and well—desperate.” “I should like to save the Shire, if I could,” he tells Gandalf. “I feel that as long as the Shire lies behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable: I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand there again.” And without much deciding at all really, Frodo acts, reasoning the world will continue to turn, and that it would turn all the better if he can throw the Ring into the Crack of Doom in Mordor, and thereby save the Shire. This, his partner Samwise also after seeing Frodo in a moment of doubt: “A new day will come, and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.” In a separate moment of weakness, Frodo wishes “none of this had happened,” something which many of us have said to ourselves over the last 18 months. Yet Gandalf responds, in one of the most wonderful things ever written in English, practically transposing Tolkien’s experience with the two World Wars and reminds Frodo: “So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All they have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to them.” ― (the final book in the trilogy)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/j-r-r-tolkein-frodo-baggins-and-gandalf-the-grey-on-covid-19/
"While the proper pronunciation of pecan remains a subject of debate, University of Georgia researchers have shown the tree nut can dramatically improve a person’s cholesterol levels. Participants at risk for cardiovascular disease who ate pecans during an eight-week intervention showed significant improvements in total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or “bad” cholesterol, in a study conducted by researchers in the UGA College of Family and Consumer Sciences. “This dietary intervention, when put in the context of different intervention studies, was extremely successful,” said Jamie Cooper, a professor in the FACS department of nutritional sciences and one of the study’s authors. “We had some people who actually went from having high cholesterol at the start of the study to no longer being in that category after the intervention.” Researchers saw an average drop of 5% in total cholesterol and between 6% and 9% in LDL among participants who consumed pecans. For context, researchers referred to a previous meta-analysis of 51 exercise interventions designed to lower cholesterol that reported an average reduction of 1% in total cholesterol and 5% in LDL cholesterol. “The addition of pecans to the diet not only produced a greater and more consistent reduction in total cholesterol and LDL compared to many other lifestyle interventions, but may also be a more sustainable approach for long-term health,” Cooper said. “Some research shows that even a 1% reduction in LDL is associated with a small reduction of coronary artery disease risk, so these reductions are definitely clinically meaningful.” Researchers assigned 52 adults between the ages of 30 and 75 who were at higher risk for cardiovascular disease to one of three groups. One group consumed 68 grams or about 470 calories of pecans a day as part of their regular diet; a second group substituted pecans for a similar amount of calories from their habitual diet, and a control group did not consume pecans. At eight weeks, participants consumed a high-fat meal to determine changes in blood lipids and the amount of glucose, or sugar, in the blood. Fasted blood lipids showed similar improvements among the two pecan groups while post-meal triglycerides were reduced in the group that added pecans. Post-meal glucose was lowered in the group that substituted pecans. “Whether people added them or substituted other foods in the diet for them, we still saw improvements and pretty similar responses in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in particular,” said Cooper, who also serves as director of the UGA Obesity Initiative. Researchers—whose work was published this month in the —pointed to the known bioactive properties of pecans for possible mechanisms driving the improvements. Pecans are high in healthy fatty acids and fiber, both of which have been linked to lower cholesterol.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/pecan-enriched-diet-shown-to-reduce-cholesterol-georgia/
"It was the spring of 2016, and 17-year-old Beatrice de Lavalette was waiting for a flight when she got hit by the terrorist bombing at Brussels airport. Along with serious burns and a spinal cord injury, De Lavalette lost both legs below the knee. Yet she says she wouldn’t be the person she is today if weren’t for those events… and the person is she will be competing as part of the U.S. Para-Equestrian team at the Paralympic Games in Tokyo. Riding is a passion not only for De Lavalette but for her family as well. She began riding at age 3 and by 12, she’d taken up dressage. Getting back in the saddle was no easy feat in light of her injuries, but she was determined to do so as soon as she was able. Five months after the bombings, thanks to her grit, determination—and extensive regimens of rehab and retraining—that’s exactly where she was. “I had no muscle, I was just skin and bones, so being back on the saddle with no sense of balance was really uncomfortable. But with time, I was able to build up the muscle and work on my balance, and it got easier with time,” she told . Of course, De Lavalette got a lot of help and encouragement along the way—from her family, her friends, the doctors and hospital staff—and from her beloved horse, DeeDee. Unsurprisingly, De Lavalette was depressed as she tried to come to terms with her injuries. She admits to crying a lot in the hospital until an unexpected visitor turned things around for her. “DeeDee saved my life,” De Lavalette said in an interview on . “My mom had figured out a way to get … DeeDee into the hospital parking lot. I said, ‘Where’s my [wheel]chair?’” “I went outside in the rain and as I got closer, she came towards me and put her head against my chest. That moment made me decide that I wasn’t going to give up on life.” It’s taken a great deal of hard work for De Lavalette to get where she is today. Having to adjust to her body’s new normal was, in many ways, like having to learn to ride all over again. But as her efforts began to pay off, the Paralympics seemed the perfect outlet to showcase her hard-earned skills. After making her first appearance as part of the U.S. Para-Dressage team in 2020, De Lavalette set her sights on Tokyo, where she’ll be riding an “awesome” 14-year-old Dutch Warmblood named Clarc. “The reason I’ve gotten to this level of recovery is because of my horses,” De Lavalette told . De Lavalette says, “I can’t change what happened, but I can succeed at being me. As I have said many times, I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. What else is there to say? There are no ‘What ifs.’ I have a new life in front of me,” she says on her . “What’s important is that I’m alive and I feel that I will do something grand with my life.” We’d say, she already has.

"A bakery run by a Cambridge graduate is teaching ex-cons new skills, including providing bread to some of Scotland’s fanciest restaurants. Freedom Bakery, in Glasgow’s East End, provides well-known eateries including Ubiquitous Chip with bread rolls. The social enterprise was set up by Matt Fountain who grew up watching his stepfather struggle to establish a life after being released from jail in  Kent—and who he had visited in prison, aged 12, and begged never to go again. Matt enrolled in university courses in Manchester, studied History of Art in London, spent a year in Glasgow, and attended Cambridge. He returned to Glasgow and had the chance to do a PhD at Oxford, but opted not to. Instead he decided to invest his time and energy into helping people, including convicted murderers, reintegrate into society. In 2014, he was granted permission to use a small kitchen in HMP Low Moss, Glasgow. Matt planned to make and sell bread and at the same time put those prisoners through a recognized qualification for the baking industry, SVQ Level 2 in Craft Baking. By 2017 he was working with prisoners in notorious Barlinnie, and pairing them with qualified bakers in order to help them obtain a qualification. Trainee bakers have a broad variety of backgrounds, and Matt’s employees are given training in self-defence due to working with prisoners. There are currently 16 employees and a third were recruited from jails. Matt said: “It’s a mixture of long term and short term sentences including drugs-related offences, fraud, and I’m afraid to say manslaughter and murder.” Matt felt out of place in Cambridge and failed to find enjoyment in it. “By the end of it I was pretty worn out and because of my background, I felt like I was living a bit of a fake life. After struggling to get a job after graduating from Cambridge, he felt at a loose end. “I thought if I had an Oxbridge degree it would help me in life,” he said. “I didn’t really know what to do. “I came to the conclusion that I should be doing something useful and I set upon this idea to raise money for the charity Shelter by cycling around the UK.” That led to the idea of starting Freedom Bakery. Matt said: “The only ideal was to make sure it was really good so it would leave a lasting impression on the person eating it, so they would understand where it came from and maybe think more positively about who made that bread. “It is important our bread tastes great and for us to be really successful, our people need to be cared for and paid fairly and if those things combine it means the bread we make is really doing good.” He described prisons as “a microcosm of humanity with both good and evil.” Matt said: “For some, the odds have been stacked against them from the beginning, so they never had a chance. An individual contacted us who has been in institutions from childhood. “He is completely institutionalized but he wants to get out and can imagine a life he can have that will be healthy and rewarding so that is what we are about.” In October the bakery will move to a larger premises. And it saw its sales increase by 12 per cent last year, despite lockdowns. Matt added: “I really feel that it is important to help people, but at the end of the day they have to want to help themselves. In terms of the help we can offer, that goes quite far with us.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bakery-scotland-ex-cons-freedom-bakery/
"The future connection between human waste, sanitation technology, and sustainable agriculture is becoming more evident. According to new research, countries could be moving closer to using human waste as fertilizer, closing the loop to more circular, sustainable economies. A new study directed by University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign civil and environmental engineering professor Jeremy Guest, characterizes the spatial distribution of human urine-derived nutrients—nitrogen, phosphorus. and potassium—and agricultural fertilizer demand to define supply-demand location typologies, their prevalence across the globe, and the implications for resource recovery. “The total amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium largely remains constant in our bodies, once we stop growing,” said Guest. “Whatever comes in through food and drink must come out in our urine, feces and sweat. Knowing that, we can estimate how much of each of these nutrients is in a population’s bodily waste if we know their diet.” Previous studies by Guest and others have assessed the potential for recovering the nutrients from human waste across the globe and identified locations with a surplus of human waste-derived nutrients relative to the local demand for agricultural fertilizers. “The new study is the first to describe human waste-derived nutrient supply-demand location relationships using a single mathematical equation,” Guest said. “The quality of sanitation infrastructure varies greatly across the globe, as do people’s diets and the availability of land suitable for agriculture. Having the means to characterize and quantitatively compare a location’s nutrient-recovery potential can go a long way to better inform decision-makers when it comes to future sanitation and agriculture policy.” The team performed extensive numerical and geographic analyses of dietary, population, sanitation and agricultural data from 107 countries to accomplish this quantitative characterization at the global scale. The investigation revealed three distinct supply-demand typologies: countries with a co-located supply-demand; countries with a dislocated supply-demand; and countries with diverse supply-demand proximities. The United States and Australia, for example, fall under the dislocated supply-demand typology. They have intensive agriculture in areas far from large cities, thus the human waste-derived nutrient supply is far away from where it is needed, Guest said. Even with advanced sanitation infrastructure in place, this means that nutrients would need to be transported over large distances, either as heavy fluids or converted into concentrated crystalline products. Economically speaking, Guest said, it would make sense to work with a concentrated product to implement a human waste-derived fertilizer in these countries. The study reports that in countries with co-located supply-demand typologies like India, Nigeria, and Uganda, human populations are more substantively in the proximity of agricultural areas, making local reuse possible. In many communities with co-located supply-demand, however, there is a need for improved sanitation infrastructure. Guest said implementing a human waste-derived fertilizer program could be highly beneficial to sanitation and agriculture in these places. Countries like Brazil, Mexico, China, and Russia exhibit a continuum of co-location to dislocation of nutrient supply and demand. The study reports that policymakers would need to approach human waste-derived nutrient use with more regionalized strategies and a range of local reuse and transport approaches. “Higher income countries in this group may have the infrastructure and economic support for various technologies, but those with limited financial resources would require prioritization of resource-recovery technology in some areas,” Guest said. The team was surprised to find the typologies corresponded closely to the United Nations Human Development Index. “Higher HDI-scoring countries like the U.S., Western Europe, and Australia tend to fall in the dislocated supply-demand typology and lower HDI-scoring countries tend to fit the co-located supply-demand typology. Of course, there are exceptions, but we did not expect to find such a strong correlation,” Guest said. The findings are published in the journal . The team hopes this research will help clarify the salient economic, sanitation, and agricultural characteristics of countries across the globe so that decision-makers can prioritize investment, policies, and technologies that will advance goals for a circular economy and the provision of sanitation to all, Guest explained.

"One Glasgow nightclub is working to sustainably harness the energy released from its partiers on the dance floor. The pioneering system at SWG3 could save the popular nightspot up to In the run-up to the UN’s in Glasgow this November, BODYHEAT turns the energy from dancing bodies into a source for heating and cooling outlets. A statement from the club says, “We’re hugely excited to reveal our plans to introduce a state-of-the-art renewable heating and cooling system to the SWG3 complex, transforming body heat from clubbers and gig-goers into a source of energy to be used again.” The first of its kind to be installed in Scotland, BODYHEAT uses heat pumps and fluids to capture body heat generated by SWG3’s crowds, channeling their combined energy into twelve 150m-deep bore holes drilled beneath the venue. This heat can then either be used immediately to cool the audience, or stored under the ground until it’s needed to heat the building. Idly mingling, a human body radiates about 100 watts of excess heat, which can add up fast in confined spaces, and the enormous amount of heat that people dancing at clubs or gigs generate is currently ejected into the atmosphere as waste. “With this new system in place,” says the club, “we’ll be able to utilize that warmth, consuming minimal electricity and gas on site, and in turn minimizing our carbon emissions” “There’s no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought huge challenges to the events sector around the world,” said Andrew Fleming Brown, Managing Director, “but it has also created a seismic jolt across businesses, underlining the need for a stable and sustainable future.” “BODYHEAT is our innovative contribution to a global issue, and will help us to dramatically decrease our energy consumption, bringing us one step closer to becoming a carbon neutral venue in the not so distant future.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nightclub-glasgow-dancers-energy-swg3/
"Car manufacturer Nissan employs a member of staff who has ‘enhanced senses’—to ensure its products have the all-important ‘new car smell’. Peter Karl Eastland has a master’s degree in chemistry and forensic science from Leicester University. But he also possesses an extremely acute sense of smell, a gift he realized he had from an early age, which allows him to identify more than 15 smell categories. Nissan recognized he has the ‘nose for the job’ and appointed him as the ‘odor evaluation lead engineer’ at its European Technical Centre in Bedfordshire. His job is to ensure the consumer experience in the new Qashqai model isn’t compromised by any unappealing odors. Peter, dubbed the ‘Nose of Nissan’, said: “I remember as a young kid playing games where we had to identify different food stuffs, like flavours of crisps [chips], sweets, or drinks by their smell alone. “I was able to correctly identify the difference between the own-brand supermarket items and the leading brands’ products, even when the flavor was meant to be the same. “At Nissan, I work with a lot of different materials, for example polymers, rubbers, and adhesives. “Having a trained nose means that I can tell the difference between fake and real leather, or cloth and fabric. “We aim to provide the best sensory experience for the customer. While tastes and preferences evolve over time, smell remains a constant. “Therefore, it is part of our job to make sure that any material we use is always going to be perfect in terms of odor and that all of the senses are harmonized.” Liaising with the Nissan engineering and manufacturing teams, Peter and his team test all the materials, such as the soft material used for the new 3D diamond quilted seats in a variety of conditions to replicate real-world environments. They have to consider that the chemical properties of these materials, such as odor, can change according to temperature. Where a potential new material or chemical is found to negatively affect the overall cabin ambience, Peter and his colleagues will identify alternatives to ensure the ‘sanctity’ of the new-car smell. The evaluation process blends objective and subjective assessment, culminating in a rigorous process that leaves no stone unturned in the pursuit of that perfect new-car smell. David Moss, senior vice president, region research & development, added, “That new car smell isn’t just a consequence of the manufacturing process. “Months of work are devoted throughout the development phase of the new vehicle to carefully analyze the use of materials and chemicals, such as seat fabric, adhesives, and polymers, to ensure that they don’t combine to generate an unpleasant odor for the car’s occupants. “It reflects the lengths Nissan goes to in order to make the ownership experience of any new Nissan exactly what our customers hope and expect—even in this very specialiszd area.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nissan-worker-smells-new-car-smell-as-job/
"Sally-Sue has been waiting a long time to get adopted. The 11-year-old pit bull’s been sitting in a shelter for two years, hoping to find her ever home. Now one man is on a mission to see that she does—and in a minute, you’ll sense a theme. Animal advocate Scott Poore’s company, , is a pet-centric venture promoting products aimed at helping long-term shelter pets get adopted. Poore recently took out a 30-foot billboard—located where else but Mission, Kansas—featuring Sally-Sue’s smiling face and a plea to potential pet parents to make room in their hearts and homes for the loving senior fur baby. “On social media, we tend to promote the same story to the same people,” Poore told . “A billboard, especially on I-35, it’s going to get thousands of views… All we need is that one right person to go by, make eye contact with the billboard, and we’re saving another life.” Since the billboard is a rental, Poore is working to find the permanent funding he’ll need to keep long-term shelter pets large in the public eye. Right now, he’s taking a one pooch at a time approach. When Sally Sue—currently at the —gets adopted, the next hopeful doggo candidate will get their shot at the “big time.” “The dogs that’ll be on the billboard are the ones that have been homeless the longest,” Poore told KMBC. “The goal is to find her not just a home, [but] the perfect home. As quickly as we do that, [we] move onto the next shelter pet that deserves to be up there.” While a billboard might be an unorthodox approach to pet adoption, every time another dog finds a home as a result, we’ll count that as mission accomplished.

"A landfill of 42 million tires in the sands of Kuwait is finally being cleaned up and recycled. This news in itself would be a major relief to locals who have to suffer from the clouds of black smoke arising during fires. But the government isn’t stopping there. They are aiming to create a green city of 25,000 homes in line with a post-oil Persian Gulf, with a focus on sustainability and tourism. The first step is to clear the ground. The Salmiya area, nicknamed “Rubber Mountain,” consists of hundreds of small ziggurat-like mounds of spent tires—a reaction from the one million cars which were added to Kuwait’s roads over the decade. EPSCO Global General Trading has opened a recycling facility for the tires, where they’ve been collected, shredded, and pressed into other materials like tiling and playground flooring. The plant opened in January of 2021, and has high hopes for exporting the recycled material out to nearby gulf neighbors. In their place will be South Saad Al-Abdullah City, a green city characterizing a new era in the Middle-Eastern country. “We have moved from a difficult stage that was characterized by great environmental risk,” Oil Minister Mohammed al-Fares. “Today the area is clean and all tires have been removed to begin the launch of the project of Saad Al-Abdullah city.” Expected to cost €3.3 billion and require 30 years to complete, the city hopes to feature green technology presumably like the kind one can see in other cities on the Persian Gulf, both existing and not. Saudi Arabia is a zero-emissions, car-less future city that’s centered around access to big data rather than water or crops.

"A design for plastic bottles that can be linked together has caught on as a revolution in disaster relief. Called Friendship Bottles, they have been used to construct small dining cabins that are also able to withstand Category 2 storm winds. Among the most common resource shipped on pallets to disaster-stricken areas is water. If that water were to arrive in Friendship Bottles, those whose houses were destroyed could use them to create a temporary shelter. This function of use as sustenance-shelter is a no-brainer, according to the inventor of the Tim Carlson. Carlson had been developing the design for the bottles for a decade before COVID-19 hit his home state of New York. But when he was seeing all the makeshift outdoor seating arrangements making his way to the pandemic-hit city, he realized it was the perfect opportunity to test his design. According to , he contacted Peaches Kitchen & Bar and teamed up to of Friendship Bottles with wooden support beams. Along with being quite a striking atmosphere to sit inside, because they acted like a big prism from passing cars, the cubbies stood up to the storms that recently smashed the Big Apple, proving the concept as a disaster-ready building material. Through a partnership with the Center for Architecture Science and Ecology, Friendship Bottles are being compared to other shelters used by the Red Cross and Red Crescent, including the scenarios and logistics of disaster relief efforts that might use them as delivery containers for water and subsequently as building material. Elsewhere, plastic bottles are also being made into homes and shelters that are proving to be both bulletproof and earthquake resistant , where they are filled with sand and pressed together with readily available mud. Friendship Bottles require no mortar or wire of any kind, offering a different kind of solution. One thing the Friendship team feel they have as an advantage is that there are far fewer limits on what can be assembled using the bottles after they are emptied. Rather than a prefabricated shelter with instructions, the bottles can be turned into bricks, which can then be made into anything.

"Gen Z and millennial Americans are “cashing in” on lost time due to the pandemic and applying new financial lessons from these life-changing years, according to a new survey. The new poll asked 2,000 Gen Z and millennial Americans (born in the years 1981-2003) and asked about their new spending and saving habits during the ongoing impact of the pandemic. The results found that nearly seven in 10 (69%) are getting back to spending money on things they missed because of COVID-19. And, 75% are focusing their spending on activities that allow them to catch up with friends and family. When lifted restrictions and re-openings began in early summer, Gen-Z and millennials took advantage, with 51% of respondents splurging on a trip away, while 49% have been spending money on drinks and dinners at bars and restaurants. Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of , a digital banking platform of KeyBank, the survey also found that 58% created new savings goals because their spending habits have changed. Six in 10 respondents agreed they’re more financially confident than they were before the pandemic and they credit their need to be more financially responsible to COVID-19. It’s translated to a shift in how Gen Z and millennial Americans manage their personal finances, as just over 30% admit they’re budgeting for the first time, while a further 39% are using new methods, like apps or dedicated spreadsheets to keep track of their budget. The survey found that 61% of respondents managed to save at least $1,000 from the start of the pandemic through the start of summer 2021 and one in 10 saved over $5,000. With those new savings, Gen-Z and millennials say they’ll put that towards paying off their student loans (38%), spend it on a vacation (37%), pay their rent (32%) and make payments on their credit cards (29%). “It’s encouraging to see that young Americans are feeling more financially confident throughout what continues to be a very difficult and challenging time, and that so many are focused on maintaining their hard-earned savings,” said Alyssa Schaefer, Chief Experience Officer at Laurel Road. The survey found that 77% of those with private loans now feel prepared to start paying again, compared to 62% who have federal student loans. Respondents’ confidence in their ability to save remains high, with two-thirds (66%) noting they believe they can achieve their savings goals moving forward. In fact, this is top of mind for many, as over one in five (22%) of those surveyed noted that if they had an extra $1,000 to spend for the rest of 2021 they would put it in their savings account. 1. Began using a new method of budgeting (apps, spreadsheets, etc.) – 40% 2. Created new savings goals – 31% 3. Now budgeting for the first time – 30% 4. Spoke with a financial advisor – 24% 5.

"From the truth is stranger than fiction files comes this story of two babies swapped at birth due to a hospital error. The mixup was discovered when the toddlers were 3, and then, the biological parents were faced with the agonizing prospect of taking the little girls away from the only families they’d ever known. As gut-wrenching as the scenario sounds, this one has a plot twist that’s anything but a tearjerker. Rather than rip the families apart, the collective parents found a way to raise their daughters together—under one roof. Sicilian moms Caterina Alagna and Melissa Fodera, from the fishing village of Mazara del Vallo, were both 23 years old when they gave birth to baby girls 15 minutes apart as the clock ticked toward midnight on December 31, 1998. During the New Year’s Eve celebrations, the on-duty nurses somehow managed to switch out their two tiny charges. When it was time for the mothers and newborns to head home, Alagna and Fodera both questioned why the infants weren’t wearing the clothing they’d brought, but the hospital staff assured them it was merely a wardrobe snafu. Three years later, as Alagna was picking up her daughter Melissa from nursery school, she saw something that shook her to the core. Another child, Caterina by name, bore an uncanny resemblance to Alagna’s two other biological daughters. When she recognized the little girl’s mother Fodera as the woman she’d shared the maternity ward with, the clothing incident popped into her mind—and something clicked. The swaddling hadn’t been switched… the babies had. 15 days later, DNA tests confirmed her suspicions. It was a choice neither one of them wanted to face. “I challenge anyone to raise a daughter for three years then give her up over a simple mistake,” Fodera said in an interview reported by the Times UK. But rather than simply make the swap back, the families decided it would be best to let everyone acclimate to the new situation slowly. Both girls and both sets of parents began spending time together in one house. The arrangement worked out so well that, when the two families separated on the advice of experts for a six-month trial, the plan was quickly scuttled. The switch was explained to Melissa and Caterina when they were 8 years old. The only real complication they’ve faced is the issue with their legal names. Emotionally, however, the two girls, now grown to young adulthood, couldn’t be better. Mauro Caporiccio, author of the book , also recently released as a film by RAI TV told the Times, “The girls effectively grew up with four parents and eight grandparents, and the experiment worked… Today they are more like twins than sisters and there is a kind of love which binds the two families.” The moral of the story? We may not be able to choose the families we’re born into, but we can choose the families we make—and if that choice is made with love, that can be a special thing indeed.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/babies-mixed-up-in-hospital-sicily-mazara/
"A plumber is flush with success after he landed a record deal when a music mogul heard him singing—while he fitted his bathroom. 49-year-old Kev Crane spent six weeks installing a new suite at the home of Paul Conneally—completely unaware he was the owner of a record label. Kev would spend his working days singing along to his favourite tunes on the radio including David Bowie and Meat Loaf. Record company boss Paul was so impressed with this dulcet tones he gave him a deal, and he’s now made his first album. Kev says he shocked when Paul offered him a chance to sign onto his New Reality Records, which has artists from Brazil, New York, and Britain. Stunned Kev, of Leicestershire, said, “I got a call to go and quote some bathrooms, I thought fair enough. “I then started work at Paul’s house, and I like to sing while I am working, and he pulled me into the living room one night for a conversation about my singing voice. ”I started telling him that I love music, that I used to be in a band and had written an album—more of a hobby really. ”I was shocked when he said he wanted to hear it. “I sent him the album on the Friday and I thought if I don’t hear from him over the weekend, I can just go back to work for him on the Monday and just carry on fitting his bathrooms.” Kev used to be in a cover band called ‘The Reprise’ in 1990s, covering bands like Depeche Mode, as well as writing his own music. But after two unsuccessful auditions for the popular UK tv shows and in the early 2000s, he decided to give it up. Then Paul said he really liked the album. He wanted to sign Kev up to his label. Kev says, “I carried on working at his house and at the same time finishing my album in the recording studio—it’s overwhelming. Those first tracks are now being released online, weekly up until Christmas. “My wife has been so overwhelmed by it all,” says Kev, “in tears about it. Good tears because she knows it’s my passion.” After the full release of his album, Kev plans to write for other musicians. “I’d love to do it full-time, but, at the minute, I am just going with the flow.

"Dark energy, the mysterious force that causes the universe to accelerate, may have been responsible for unexpected results from the XENON1T experiment, deep below Italy’s Apennine Mountains. A new study, led by researchers at the University of Cambridge and reported in the journal , suggests that some unexplained results from the XENON1T experiment in Italy may have been caused by dark energy, and not the dark matter the experiment was designed to detect. They constructed a physical model to help explain the results, which may have originated from dark energy particles produced in a region of the Sun with strong magnetic fields, although future experiments will be required to confirm this explanation. The researchers say their study could be an important step toward the direct detection of dark energy. Everything our eyes can see in the skies and in our everyday world – from tiny moons to massive galaxies, from ants to blue whales—makes up less than five percent of the universe. The rest is dark. About 27% is dark matter—the invisible force holding galaxies and the cosmic web together – while 68% is dark energy, which causes the universe to expand at an accelerated rate. “Despite both components being invisible, we know a lot more about dark matter, since its existence was suggested as early as the 1920s, while dark energy wasn’t discovered until 1998,” said Dr Sunny Vagnozzi from Cambridge’s Kavli Institute for Cosmology, the paper’s first author. “Large-scale experiments like XENON1T have been designed to directly detect dark matter, by searching for signs of dark matter ‘hitting’ ordinary matter, but dark energy is even more elusive.” To detect dark energy, scientists generally look for gravitational interactions: the way gravity pulls objects around. And on the largest scales, the gravitational effect of dark energy is repulsive, pulling things away from each other and making the universe’s expansion accelerate. About a year ago, the XENON1T experiment reported an unexpected signal, or excess, over the expected background. “These sorts of excesses are often flukes, but once in a while they can also lead to fundamental discoveries,” said co-author Dr Luca Visinelli, from Frascati National Laboratories in Italy. “We explored a model in which this signal could be attributable to dark energy, rather than the dark matter the experiment was originally devised to detect.” At the time, the most popular explanation for the excess were axions—hypothetical, extremely light particles—produced in the Sun. However, this explanation does not stand up to observations, since the amount of axions that would be required to explain the XENON1T signal would drastically alter the evolution of stars much heavier than the Sun, in conflict with what we observe. We are far from fully understanding what dark energy is, but most physical models for dark energy would lead to the existence of a so-called fifth force. There are four fundamental forces in the universe, and anything that can’t be explained by one of these forces is sometimes referred to as the result of an unknown fifth force. However, we know that Einstein’s theory of gravity works extremely well in the local universe. Therefore, any fifth force associated to dark energy is unwanted and must be hidden, or screened, when it comes to small scales, and can only operate on the largest scales where Einstein’s theory of gravity fails to explain the acceleration of the Universe. To hide the fifth force, many models for dark energy are equipped with so-called screening mechanisms, which dynamically hide the fifth force. Vagnozzi and his co-authors constructed a physical model, which used a type of screening mechanism known as chameleon screening, to show that dark energy particles produced in the Sun’s strong magnetic fields could explain the XENON1T excess. “Our chameleon screening shuts down the production of dark energy particles in very dense objects, avoiding the problems faced by solar axions,” said Vagnozzi. “It also allows us to decouple what happens in the local very dense Universe from what happens on the largest scales, where the density is extremely low.” The researchers used their model to show what would happen in the detector if the dark energy was produced in a region of the Sun called the tachocline, where the magnetic fields are particularly strong. “It was really surprising that this excess could in principle have been caused by dark energy rather than dark matter,” said . “When things click together like that, it’s really special.” Their calculations suggest that experiments like XENON1T, which are designed to detect dark matter, could also be used to detect dark energy. However, the original excess still needs to be convincingly confirmed. “We first need to know that this wasn’t simply a fluke,” said Visinelli. “If XENON1T actually saw something, you’d expect to see a similar excess again in future experiments, but this time with a much stronger signal.” If the excess was the result of dark energy, upcoming upgrades to the XENON1T experiment, as well as experiments pursuing similar goals such as LUX-Zeplin and PandaX-xT, mean that it could be possible to directly detect dark energy within the next decade.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/dark-energy-cambridge-scientists-research/
"The populations of several species and subspecies of rhinoceros are increasing, some dramatically, while poaching rates in east Asia have plummeted over the decade, a new report from the International Rhino Foundation (IRF) reveals. Involved in all things rhino, the IRF releases an annual report known as The State of the Rhino, which this year highlights that even in the midst of a rare pandemic, dedicated individuals in a dozen countries are working to keep rhino numbers healthy and recovering. Indeed, the IRF has invested $20 million worldwide into rhino conservation projects over the last 10 years, and in many countries their work is paying off. The largest success has no doubt come by way of the greater one-horned rhino. Native to India and Nepal, during the early 1900s there were a mere 100 individuals left. Today there are 3,700 and ever increasing in number. Over the last eight years, poaching incidents have fallen from 41 in 2013, to just 1 at present day. In the Indian state of Assam, rhinos can be found in four protected areas, and this year the population in the magnificent Manas National Park on the border with Nepal had reached 47 individuals having only been established with 4 just a few years ago. : Nepal also saw an increase of 107 greater one-horned rhinos in their country. Javan rhinos in Indonesia welcomed four new calves into the world, increasing the critically-endangered species to 75, greatly offsetting the rate of natural death. This is almost double the number of Javan rhinos from 2011. In Africa, the black rhino has seen an encouraging population increase of 16-17% over the past decade, while South Africa’s “Rhino court” established to hear exclusively poaching cases was reopened in April of this year, giving rangers the opportunity to testify against suspects without expensive travel to a major city, and without poaching cases falling into a court backlog. : In Zimbabwe, black rhino were reintroduced after a 30-year absence and are growing steadily, while in Kenya, anti-poaching efforts have dropped the number of rhinos killed to 0 this year, down from a high of 59 in 2013. “We must act today, to ensure these marvelous creatures can thrive for future generations,” Nina Fascione, executive director of IRF. “Let’s continue to build on our successes of greater one-horned, black, and Javan rhinos and reverse the declines for Sumatran and white rhinos, working together so rhinos can continue to thrive on Earth.” :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/african-and-indonesian-rhinos-grow-in-number-despite-pandemic-challenges/

As strange as it may seem in a country as seemingly wet and cloudy as Ireland to have multiple firefighter units for a single city, the unique solution gives the chance for a largely forgotten piece of wild natural heritage to raise awareness of the fascinating breed on its own behalf. a video about these beautiful goats…",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-old-irish-goat-controls-wildfires-on-howths-head-ireland/
"A smile is the key to a thousand doors, but deploying it in every situation without mastery of its use is dangerous, says a new social science study. They say it takes 400 muscles to smile, well scientists at Queen’s University Belfast found that subtle differences in the way in which a person smiled had not-so-subtle impacts on the opinions which the test participants had about the smiler. “Smiling at another person does not always lead to trust and cooperation,” said Dr. Stephanie Carpenter from the University of Michigan, a co-author of the study. “Subtle differences in a smile can have a real impact on whether people trust each other and choose to cooperate. In fact, the way you smile in a good or bad situation can impact whether people trust you.” While playing a set of economic games, such as those that require trust to create value for both players, or which can confer more value for a single person willing to deceive, the subject individual first displayed uncooperative behavior and thus triggered a loss of trust or confidence in their partner. It was then that, depending on the characteristics of the smile made at game’s end by the subject, the participants altered their expectations of how the smiler would behave during the next game. Three different smiles were used, which were labeled as reward, dominance, and affiliation. These three words belittle the emotional reaction they trigger, and a glance at each one invokes strong feelings, and likely memories of seeing such expressions in the past. After untrustworthy or uncooperative behavior, a reward smile—a big ear-to-ear smile like a kid who got the ice cream he was begging for, and a dominance smile, a smirk-y sign of superiority, elicited very little trust, expectations of change in behavior, and positivity when compared with a totally neutral expression, or a look of regret, meaning that sometimes smiles can create even stronger negative feelings than not smiling. However the “affiliation smile,” which seems to have a hint of regret, like the smile a someone might make after consoling a dear friend, the broken relationship and to trust the person who had just done something unfair. “Think about movie villains, for example in James Bond films,” said Dr. Magdalena Rychlowska from Queen’s University, who led the research published in journal. “They often make happy smiles when something bad has happened or is about to happen. This context makes these otherwise happy and normal smiles feel threatening and unpleasant.” She adds, “The findings of this study show the power of subtle facial expressions and the positive consequences that an affiliation smile can have in difficult situations. It also highlights the importance of social context—a happy smile that could be read as a signal of trustworthiness in one setting can, in another setting, be seen as evidence of bad intentions.” Mastery of the smile then, can be an excellent way of getting out of difficult social situations, while the lack thereof can be an excellent way of getting into one.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/scientists-have-determined-that-certain-smiles-damage-trust-while-others-can-repair-it/
"The future of travel is bold, with a boat-plane hybrid set to transform short distance ferry services. From the to to self-driving cars to, now, this, the is an electric transport plane that can do 180 mph, or around six-times the speed of a ferry, and with double the range of electric aircraft, but with half the manufacturing costs. All these pros are down to its unique design as essentially a trio of vehicles in one, which the company believes will seize control of a market for short flights/ferry routes such as LA to Santa Barbara or San Francisco, or New York to Boston, with maybe Washington, D.C. thrown in there as well. When loading and offloading passengers, the seaglider rests on the sea like a normal seaplane or boat. When operating within the crowded waters of a port, the seaglider deploys its hydrofoils, matching its impressive propulsion with the maneuverability of the foils below. Once on the open sea, the foils are withdrawn and it takes on the aspects of a “wing-in-ground effect vehicle,” a design invented all the way back in the 1960s, that uses high speeds to hover just above the surface of the water. ( ) So far REGENT’s founders almost $10 million from investors, which have included Mark Cuban and Peter Thiel. Wing-in-ground effect vehicles are actually considered boats, and subject to maritime, rather than aviation laws. In this way the seaglider can skirt around current technology limitations of battery-powered electric motors and offer truly zero-emissions transport. The company imagines that battery advances currently being pursued should raise the range of the seaglider to 500 miles from 180 miles in the not-too-distant future. The company has received statements of intent worth $465 million, have acquired the sponsor dollars of operators Brittany Ferries, Goombay Air, and SplitExpress, and expect to have a quarter-sized prototype by the end of the year, and a full-sized prototype operational in 2023.

"A personalized, mRNA vaccine, given to patients with particular kinds of aggressive cancers could leverage the immune system of the patient to kill the cancer on its own, and in doing so usher in a new epoch of cancer treatment. Messenger RNA (ribonucleic acid) vaccines were what sparked the COVID-19 vaccine drives, as Pfizer and Moderna adapted the technology to create an emergency treatment to train the body to fight off the viral spike protein. What most of us won’t know however, is that the mRNA vaccines were originally in development for aggressive cancer types. Molly Cassidy, a mother studying for the Arizona Bar exam, is living proof that while the approach isn’t a panacea, it can clear away some of the most dreadful and fast cancers we know of. After being diagnosed with head and neck cancer, she underwent surgery and chemotherapy. However it was only ten days after finishing chemo that she found a marble-like bump on her collarbone from the cancer’s swift return. Later examinations found it had spread from her ear all the way to her lungs, and she was told to get her affairs in order. Cassidy she was eligible to join a clinical trial at the University of Arizona, testing an mRNA vaccine personalized to the cancer mutations of the host. By 27 weeks, Cassidy had received nine vaccine doses paired with an immunotherapy drug, and her CT scans were clear: the cancer had left her body. A personalized medicine approach to disease is challenging, however it could be said that the rise of cancer and of so many other diseases across the west is a result of the broader Western-health sector adopting a once-size fits all (or one-pill fits all) approach to everything from cancer to diet to mental health. Precision or personalized medicine is becoming a little more common now, with many paying more attention to genetic phenotypes and other biomarkers before drafting a therapy plan. This approach recently broke ground in a huge way and the USDA is using artificial intelligence based on demographics and other information to Tailor-made mRNA vaccines are an exciting form of personalized medicine to treat cancer, and involve taking a tissue sample from the patient’s tumor and analyzing it for mutations. This not only hones the immune system into the cancerous cells, but differentiates them from healthy, non-cancerous cells. The result is that the messenger RNA creates proteins shed from the exterior of the tumor and brings immune cells like T cells up to speed on how to fight it. “One of the things cancer does is it can turn on signals to tell the immune system to quiet down so the cancer is not detected,” explains Daniel Anderson, a biotech scientist at MIT, to . “The goal of an mRNA vaccine is to alert and gear up the immune system to go after the characteristic features of tumor cells and attack them.” Currently, phase-one clinical trials are running for metastatic melanoma, GI-tract cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic and ovarian cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. One of the most exciting things, even in these early days of mRNA cancer vaccines, is that they will offer a chance at survival for advanced and incurable cancers, not only because they have the potential to be very effective, but also because patients, like in Cassidy’s case, will have no other options. It’s likely the personalized mRNA vaccines will in practice be paired with —a breakthrough class of treatment that won the Nobel Prize in 2018. Similar to stem cell treatment, a patient’s T cells are drawn out before being multiplied in a lab, trained on the target cancer cell, and then reintroduced to help fight off the cancer. Some animal studies have had success in this way, with one group of rats , and another group showing National Geographic concluded their feature on mRNA vaccines with a suggestion that based on early success, FDA-approval could be given in around five years.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/mrna-vaccines-could-offer-personal-treatments-for-some-of-the-words-cancers/
"Researchers from Switzerland are tapping into an unexpected energy source right under our feet: wooden floorings. Their nanogenerator enables wood to generate energy from our footfalls. They also improved the wood used in the their nanogenerator with a combination of a silicone coating and embedded nanocrystals, resulting in a device that was 80 times more efficient—enough to power LED lightbulbs and small electronics. The team began by transforming wood into a nanogenerator by sandwiching two pieces of functionalized wood between electrodes. Like a shirt-clinging sock fresh out of the dryer, the wood pieces become electrically charged through periodic contacts and separations when stepped on, a phenomenon called the triboelectric effect. The electrons can transfer from one object to another, generating electricity. However, there’s one problem with making a nanogenerator out of wood. “Wood is basically triboneutral,” says senior author Guido Panzarasa, group leader in the professorship of Wood Materials Science. “It means that wood has no real tendency to acquire or to lose electrons.” This limits the material’s ability to generate electricity, “so the challenge is making wood that is able to attract and lose electrons,” Panzarasa explains. To boost wood’s triboelectric properties, the scientists coated one piece of the wood with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a silicone that gains electrons upon contact, while functionalizing the other piece of wood with in-situ-grown nanocrystals called zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8). ZIF-8, a hybrid network of metal ions and organic molecules, has a higher tendency to lose electrons. They also tested different types of wood to determine whether certain species or the direction in which wood is cut could influence its triboelectric properties by serving as a better scaffold for the coating. The researchers found that a triboelectric nanogenerator made with radially cut spruce, a common wood for construction in Europe, performed the best. Together, the treatments boosted the triboelectric nanogenerator’s performance: it generated 80 times more electricity than natural wood. The device’s electricity output was also stable under steady forces for up to 1,500 cycles. The researchers found that a wood floor prototype with a surface area slightly smaller than a piece of paper can produce enough energy to drive household LED lamps and small electronic devices such as calculators. They successfully lit up a lightbulb with the prototype when a human adult walked upon it, turning footsteps into electricity. “Our focus was to demonstrate the possibility of modifying wood with relatively environmentally friendly procedures to make it triboelectric,” says Panzarasa. “Spruce is cheap and available and has favorable mechanical properties. The functionalization approach is quite simple, and it can be scalable on an industrial level. It’s only a matter of engineering.” Besides being efficient, sustainable, and scalable, the newly developed nanogenerator also preserves the features that make the wood useful for interior design, including its mechanical robustness and warm colors. The researchers say that these features might help promote the use of wood nanogenerators as green energy sources in smart buildings. They also say that wood construction could help mitigate climate change by sequestering CO2 from the environment throughout the material’s lifespan. The next step for Panzarasa and his team, whose work has been published in journal, is to further optimize the nanogenerator with chemical coatings that are more eco-friendly and easier to implement. “Even though we initially focused on basic research, eventually, the research that we do should lead to applications in the real world,” says Panzarasa. “The ultimate goal is to understand the potentialities of wood beyond those already known and to enable wood with new properties for future sustainable smart buildings.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wooden-floors-harvest-enough-energy-to-turn-on-a-lightbulb/
"Adorable footage shows the moment a family of ducks checked out of a university library after they had waddled in off the street. The mother and her five ducklings stunned staff and students when they wandered in through an open door at the University of Nottingham’s George Green Library. Emma Halford-Busby, from University of Nottingham Libraries, said, “It had been very hot that week, so we had left our doors open for some extra air movement.” The ducks came in and “walked around our atrium for a while, mom in front and ducklings in a line behind. Mom was totally calm and unflustered.” After they apparently checked out the range of books on the shelves. “You often come across ducks in seemingly odd places around campus, but that was definitely the oddest place I’ve seen them. “It did bring some excitement into an otherwise peaceful evening…” Video footage shows the bird family heading under the security barrier as they eventually made their exit back to their pond. Emma says, “As they walked towards our other entrance, one of our staff gently ushered them through the gates and back outside.” Commenting on social media, one student noted,” That is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.” Another said, perhaps a little enviously,, “They can they just ‘duck’ under the underneath the barriers…” Fowl play to them, we say.

"Out of the ashes of Pompeii, archaeologists recently pulled up a time capsule, though only the bronze hinges remained of what is being described as a “sorceress’ toolkit.” Inside were a collection of around 100 little objects: two mirrors, tiny skulls, scarab beetles, bone-carved objects like buttons, bells, and little fists, decorative elements made of amber, carnelian, and bronze, carved images of men and satyrs, and of course, miniature phallic amulets. All in all it’s everything your average sorceress could need on the job, which archaeologists believe were to tell fortunes, divine pregnancies, conduct fertility rites, and ward off bad luck. “They are objects of everyday life in the female world and are extraordinary because they tell micro-stories, biographies of the inhabitants of the city who tried to escape the eruption” states Pomeii General Director Massimo Osanna. “In the same house, we discovered a room with ten victims, including women and children, and now we are trying to establish kinship relationships, thanks to DNA analysis. Perhaps the precious box belonged to one of these victims.” The box containing the toolkit was found in the Garden House in Regio V, a luxurious villa which also included on the walls, such as the myth of Queen Leda and the Swan, and a fresco of Priapus, the god of fertility. are that the owner of the objects was not of status and could even have been a slave. The lack of gold or precious stones among the trinkets suggests this, as the Pompeiians adored the yellow metal. Speaking with , Osanna theorized the objects belonged a kind of Roman love doctor, but that’s pure speculation. The toolkit will soon be on display in the Palestra Grande on the Pompeii site. It’s fascinating that, even though most of us grew up learning about the city of Pompeii buried under the ash of Vesuvius, major discoveries are still being made there today despite the fact the site is only 163 acres (66 hectares).",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/a-sorceress-toolkit-of-small-fertility-objects-was-uncovered-in-pompeii/
"Dogs can tell the difference between deliberate actions—and mistakes, say scientists. It adds growing evidence to the idea that man’s best friend knows just how we are feeling. First author Dr Britta Schunemann said, “The dogs in our study clearly behaved differently depending on whether the actions of a human experimenter were intentional or unintentional.” Dogs have bonded with people over thousands of years. Obeying every “sit,” “lay down,” and “roll over” command is just one such skill. But whether they understand intentions, or merely respond to outcomes, remains unclear. This is a basic component of Theory of Mind—long regarded as uniquely human. It’s the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others and dogs have it too. They can tell the difference between something done on purpose, or by accident. Dr Schunemann, of Gottingen University, and colleagues tested how they reacted when food rewards were withheld. The researchers found the animals behaved differently depending on whether the actions of the experimenter were intentional or unintentional. It shows dogs can distinguish between actions that were done on purpose, or accidentally. To reach their conclusions, the German team conducted an experiment using the ‘unable vs. unwilling’ paradigm. It works by examining whether test subjects react differently towards a human experimenter. They either intentionally (the unwilling condition) or unintentionally (the unable condition) withhold treats. The experiment was conducted with 51 dogs, each of which was tested under three conditions. Each animal was separated from the human tester by a transparent barrier. It was fed pieces of dog food through a gap. In the ‘unwilling’ condition, the experimenter suddenly withdrew the reward through the gap in the barrier and placed it in front of herself. In the ‘unable-clumsy’ condition, the experimenter brought the reward to the gap and ‘tried’ to pass it through—but then ‘accidentally’ dropped it. In the “unable-blocked” condition, the experimenter again tried to give the dog a reward. But she was unable to because the gap was blocked. In all conditions, the reward remained on the tester’s side of the barrier. Co-author Dr Juliane Brauer, of Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, said, “If dogs are indeed able to ascribe intention-in-action to humans we would expect them to show different reactions in the unwilling condition compared to the two unable conditions. As it turns out, this is exactly what we observed.” The primary behaviour measured by the researchers was the time dogs waited before approaching the reward they were denied. If dogs are able to identify human intentions, they would wait longer before approaching the reward in the unwilling condition, where they were not supposed to have the reward, than in the two unable conditions in which the reward was, in fact, meant for them. Not only did the dogs wait longer in the unwilling condition than in the unable conditions, they were also more likely to sit or lie down—actions often interpreted as appeasing behaviours—and stop wagging their tails. Co-author Dr Hannes Rakoczy, also from Gottingen, said, “This suggests dogs may indeed be able to identify humans’ intention-in-action.” The findings in suggest dogs “may have at least one aspect of Theory of Mind—the capacity to recognize intention-in-action,” said the researchers. Previous studies have found dogs can tell the difference between happy and angry faces. They also process language in a very similar way to humans—picking out emotional tone, intonation, and volume changes that influence meaning. Experts think dogs have gradually evolved over 30,000 years to understand humans. Selective breeding has meant those which could communicate better with their owners were preferred, encouraging the trait to become more pronounced over time.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/max-planck-dogs-intentional-human-behavior/
"Foraging is a great way to get out into nature, stretch your legs, learn where your food comes from, and save a bit of dollar on groceries. Autumn is one of the only times a year where everywhere you look there’s something you can eat. Orchards are flush with fruit, bushes spring to life with berries, mushrooms emerge from the forests, while on the coasts, bivalves are at their most plentiful. Foraging is fun, but it should always be done with care to avoid both poison and the law, so there’s sort of an unwritten “Forager’s Code” worth following: , and the most numerous are the sweet crabapple, southern crabapple, and Oregon or pacific crabapple. Rich in the setting agent pectin, and often more sour than sweet, crabapples are perfect accompaniments to other fruit in jams and preserves. Having enjoyed roses in spring and summer, autumn yields the famous rosehip, , but also fine to eat as they are found, plump and red from September to October in hedgerows, gardens, and public parks. They are rich in vitamin C, A, D, and E, and can also be used in cosmetics and grooming products. Just be sure to eat around or sieve out the seeds, as the hairs around them are  an irritant. Blackberries, really there’s not much to be said. They grow profusely and can produce waterfalls of berries in late-summer early autumn. They have nasty thorns so maybe think about wearing thick gloves when harvesting this one? Perfect for roasting on an open fire, chestnuts fall from their trees encased in large green balls of perilous spikes. They are sweet, and able to be roasted or even boiled in red wine, but there are a few things to note beforehand. First, squirrels adore them, and so you must act fast to collect your share. Second, the easiest way to collect them is to stomp on the sea-urchin like casing with a leather shoe, or something that can be penetrated by a small woody needle, and pick them out carefully. Lastly, you’ll need to store them in the freezer if you want them to last all the way to Christmas, so you’ll need to cut a deep slit into the long side of the chestnut , (you could use a knife too). If you feel like putting the effort in to crack open enough acorns to spoon out the nut material inside, soaking out the tannins and grinding them into powder, you will be rewarded with a super nutrient-dense, stodgy flour that Native Americans used to make bread and even a kind of cake, with a taste a little bit like peanut butter (or so I’ve heard). The bounty of the sea, that is to say, mollusks and bivalves, While foraging mussels, cockles, clams, and oysters on wild sections of coastline, or digging for them in mudflats is perhaps more ideally a winter activity, one can start in November. Mussels should be picked only from fine clear waters at low tide, in areas where the tide doesn’t bring with it too much plastic and debris. They should be left in a bucket of saltwater overnight to clear out the grit. Flat sandy beaches can contain cockles, small-shelled bivalves that grow in clumps. Look for cockle shells on the surface then rake across very lightly and shallow. Like mussels, leave them in the bucket overnight. There are more than fifty different varieties of chanterelle, but all will radiate a luxurious perfume of citrus and apricot. Even though there may be some other mushrooms that look like the golden forest-lighthouse that is the chanterelle, they won’t have that wonderful scent. where there’s no sun whatsoever, and where water will remain in the soil longer than usual. These mushrooms are one of the “Foolproof Four” forageable mushrooms, as they are and have few dangerous twins. Shaggy manes develop black gills that exude an ink-like substance, while their stems are hollow and fibrous. Otherwise a Google image search would do you well for finding them. The mushroom will start to degrade soon, and must ideally be cooked before the day is done. A delicate woody taste means that anything strong will overpower the mushrooms completely. Boletes mushrooms are different from others mostly by the lack of “gills” on the underside of their caps, replaced instead by what looks like sea or bath sponge. The king boletes or porcini is the king of the mushrooms, and, without drowning this listicle in detail, they must be processed—pickled, frozen, or dried with a proper dehydrator. They are wonderfully delicious, and should be looked for around . In the mountains is the best place to look, as the forest, along with reaching the right temperatures only a few hours per day-night cycle, is also easiest to reach by other mushroom hunters… Having hunted porcini in the mountains of Italy, what kind of luck it is to find around 14 kilograms of them. The people I told simply could not believe it. I didn’t have the heart to tell them that I had to throw almost all of them away, because they turned into maggot hotels within 12 hours of leaving the woods; to this day it is one of my greatest shames, but I did not understand the speed at which one must move having found them.

"Sweeping educational reforms, aimed to reduce the sometimes crippling pressure for pupils to succeed at school, have seen end-of-year exams ended for children in China aged 6 and 7. The ban mirrors one passed earlier this year for written homework for first and second graders, and one limiting the homework burden on Junior High students to 1.5 hours per night. This reporter has worked in the Chinese private tutoring industry, and seen first-hand the pressure which the desire for a strong education has created within students, but also in parents, who will regularly work themselves to the bone in order to furnish the exorbitant tutoring costs associated with a first-class education. It was not uncommon for me to meet students who had more than 20 classes per week entirely outside the school system, and which could include music and English or French, but also private instruction based on what they went through that week in school. “Too frequent exams… which cause students to be overburdened and under huge exam pressure,” have been axed by the Ministry of Education’s reforms published on Monday. They added that the exam burden “harms their mental and physical health.” Indeed a of 43 high school students in Yunnan province found that they all saw education as a whole as nothing more than merely the passing of an examination, before the preparation for another. “This particular approach, at its worst,” the authors wrote, “can stifle a student’s imagination, creativity, and sense of self, qualities crucial for a child’s ultimate success in and out of the classroom.” The average public school classroom can be between 40 and 60 students, giving teachers very little time for individual attention. If a child cannot keep pace with the class, there are typically two options the parents can take. One option is to bribe the teacher to ensure their child is thoroughly understanding every lesson, however if some other parents have offered higher bribes, an informal bidding war can sometimes occur. The other option is to go for tutoring, which can easily cost $15,000 a year, as China has one the largest tutoring sector on Earth, worth $100 billion per year. Previously, children took yearly exams so as to prepare for the university entrance test—”the dreaded gaokao” , which can define a young person’s life trajectory. The reforms were put in place to try and close the educational gap in school, which has caused all manner of social distortions. One example is that catchment areas of good schools are highly sought after, driving the prices of real estate sky high. Another is the concentration of good teachers at good schools, as more public and private money finds its way into the coffers of schools that crank out better-testing pupils. The Party addressed this by imposing a forced rotation for teachers every six years. Far beside the one-child, and now two-child policy, the cost of school made having multiple kids economically unfeasible. Now with the slowest population growth in decades, attempts to ease the financial burden of school is seen as welcome relief to parents.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/china-bans-yearly-exams-for-students-aged-6-7/
"Eight in 10 Americans believe their health is a “work in progress,” and many have been taking steps to improve their lifestyle. According to a new survey of 13,000 people in 24 countries—including 2,000 in the U.S.—this feeling isn’t unique to Americans. 82 percent of people globally felt the same (compared to 84% of Americans), and 89% of all respondents are currently taking steps to improve their health. Of those, 81% said the pandemic helped kickstart them into doing so—and these steps are having a clear impact on respondents’ health. Globally, 56% of respondents can now run or exercise longer without feeling winded, while 48% have gone down a size or a belt notch. Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of and the , the survey found the average respondent is currently working to break three unhealthy habits. Results delved into the specific small steps that respondents are taking to do so. Respondents revealed they started their journey to be healthier by exercising more, cooking/eating more nutritious foods, or downloading a fitness app. Purchasing less junk food, beginning to take walks during their lunch break, and taking vitamins or supplements were other “first steps” respondents took—or plan to take to support their health. The survey delved further into vitamins and supplements and found them to be a priority for many respondents across the globe. When asked about how their health goals have changed during the pandemic, half said they’re more focused on eating healthier, including supplementing their diet with vitamins and minerals. And of those who currently take vitamins or supplements, results revealed the average respondent spends about $286 every year. Americans were slightly above that, at an average of $304 per year. “Be it exercising, healthy cooking or including more vitamins and supplements to your routine, for many, the pandemic has provided an opportunity to improve health habits overall,” said Dr. Kent Bradley, chief health and nutrition officer at Herbalife Nutrition. “Consistency is key when one commits to a healthy lifestyle.” But while many respondents plan to incorporate more vitamins and supplements into their diet, only 69% said they feel knowledgeable about the health benefits those can offer. Thirty percent of respondents said they are most likely to get information about vitamins and supplements from internet searches, media, and social media, followed by consulting with their doctor (27%). Regardless of where they currently get information, 77% would like to know more about the nutritional benefits of different vitamins and supplements to support their health. “Being well informed about the proper use, as well as benefits of nutritional supplements, is critical as supplements can enhance every wellness journey,” said Brian Wommack, senior vice president of the Council for Responsible Nutrition.

"Reaching the age of 100 in good health and good spirits is an accomplishment in its own right, but training to take home your next weightlifting trophy truly takes the (birthday) cake. At the age of 98 years and 94 days, great-great-grandmother Edith Murway-Traina already had a Guinness World Record (GWR) as the “oldest female competitive powerlifter” under her belt—and she successfully deadlifted 150 pounds to do it. Traina’s storied win will be featured in the . As a former dance instructor and performer, physical fitness was always a way of life for the Bronx-born Florida transplant, but considering she took up weightlifting a scant nine years ago, the progress Traina’s made is truly impressive—especially since discovering her newfound avocation was pretty much a happy accident. Traina was tagging along with pal Carmen Gutworth who’d cajoled her into accompanying her to the gym to try out some new exercises. “She didn’t want to go by herself,” Murway-Traina told the . “She dragged me kicking and screaming all the way, so that’s more or less how I got there. “I saw all these other ladies lifting weights, and it looked interesting. I picked up a couple of weights and had to prove to myself that I could accomplish this.” While Gutworth disputes her friend’s version of the events: “You can’t drag Edith anywhere,” she jokingly told . “Edith kept going because she always keeps going. She will not quit, and anything that’s hard… that makes her more determined. If it’s easy, she might get bored, but if it’s hard, she’s going to do it. Nobody’s going to tell her, ‘Oh, that’s too hard for me.’” Once she got started, Traina turned out to be a natural. Soon enough, she was on the team, competing in senior events, and bringing home accolades and awards. “When you pull a bar up and you lift it, there’s a certain power that you experience that is only yours. It belongs to you,” she told the Post. Traina admits that harking back to her days as an entertainer, a great deal of her motivation has to do with how much she enjoys being in the limelight and the positive feedback she’s received. She says that every time she’d compete, she’d get applause, and every time she’d get applause, she’d get a little bit happier. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Traina’s doctors sent her to the sidelines but she returned to the gym as soon as she got the green light. She’s now back in training with coach Bill Beekley, working hard to make up for lost time and get back in shape for an upcoming November competition at which she hopes to bring home yet another winner’s cup to add to her collection. Traina also appreciates that her current notoriety largely has to do with her advanced age, but as long as she can be a positive role model who blows the “sweet little old lady stereotype” out of the water, she’s good with that. “I think in my nineties, I became more aware of the need for people to be recognized for who they are, or what they are, or how they are and it’s the most beautiful thing in the world,” she told . “I think I survive on that, mostly, myself.” That, some well-deserved applause, and her next trophy, of course.

"Years of cognitive development research have uncovered a wealth of knowledge about what children need to grow, thrive, and learn—but it’s also important to translate those insights into real-world applications. A new paper led by Penn State graduate Brenna Hassinger-Das, now an assistant professor of psychology at Pace University-NYC, and Jennifer Zosh, professor of human development and family studies at Penn State Brandywine, explores the science-backed core pillars of learning and examples of play spaces that incorporate them. “We know kids in Western countries spend only 20% of their time at school, so where are they for the other 80%?” Hassinger-Das said. “They’re at home, or in the grocery store, or the park. How can we transform those everyday spaces to encourage playful learning and promote conversations between caregivers and children? We wanted to maximize these spaces and turn them into places that are fun but also support the kind of learning you do in school.” According to the researchers, previous studies have found six core characteristics or “pillars” of learning that can maximize any experience a child has, whether it’s playing in the park, going to the grocery store, or using a smartphone app. These pillars suggest that experiences should be active rather than passive, engaging, meaningful, socially interactive, iterative rather than repetitive, and joyful. “We wanted to leverage insights from research to help support children, families and communities,” Zosh said. “For this specific initiative, we wanted to see how we could take those pillars and apply them to communities in playful ways that support children’s learning.” The paper looked at several examples of spaces that incorporated the pillars into their designs. One example was Urban Thinkscape, an installation that turned a bus stop into a playful learning space that fosters play and conversations. One of the features incorporated was an element called Stories, which includes several icons placed on the ground with different pictures that can be used to tell stories. According to the researchers, as children go from icon to icon and create a story, they build narrative skills, which are a key part of literacy. Even though the paper—recently published in the journal focused on public spaces that incorporated these elements, the researchers said anyone can use the pillars to enhance children’s play spaces and experiences, including parents at home. Stay “active” as you play and interact with your child, for example, by incorporating literary and STEM elements into your speech and interactions. Zosh said this could mean counting the apples out loud as you put them in your basket at the grocery store or asking your child what letter each block starts with as you build a tower. She also said asking lots of questions — such as “What would happen if we mixed these blue and yellow paints together?” or “What might happen if we stack the red square block on top of the yellow triangle block?” — can be helpful, as well. “Try to limit distractions as much as possible, including background television and your own smartphone use,” Hassinger-Das said. “These types of distractions are sometimes unavoidable, but they do have the potential to take away from these high-quality times with your child. Focusing and staying engaged during play can help you make the most of these interactions.” Try building on topics the child is already interested in during play. If they like dinosaurs, you could suggest a make-believe scenario where you dig for dinosaur fossils at the playground. Or, you can integrate information about dinosaurs like counting how many bones they have and what they ate. “If you are reading a book set in a different state, get out a globe or a map app and explore where the state is and how the weather there is different from where you live,” Zosh said. “Helping children build connections helps them weave together a rich world of understanding.” The researchers advised letting your child lead in play time while you offer support along the way. For example, let your child decide what to build with blocks while asking questions like, “What would happen if you placed that block in a different direction?” or “How many more blocks do you think it would take to build a tower as tall as you?” Children are naturally scientific thinkers — they like to experiment, see what happens, and try again and again until something works. The researchers advised giving your children opportunities to guess what will happen, conduct “experiments,” make up new words to favorite songs, and make mistakes. Every mistake leads to learning. Finally, making playtime joyful can be done in many ways, including incorporating elements of surprise. “Playing with shadows and asking which one is bigger or how you can make your shadow grow or shrink is one way to foster surprise and joy,” Hassinger-Das said. “Similarly, think about what helps your child connect with whatever brings them joy, from construction with a cardboard box to playing vet with their stuffed animals.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/science-backed-tips-play-time-with-kids/
"If you judge a city’s heart by how much they’re willing to go the extra mile even for its non-human citizens, Arlington in Texas recently proved that things really bigger in the Lone Star State. When Zoey, a 15-year-old deaf Lab mix wandered away from her home, practically the whole community turned out to help find her. “I had put on NextDoor app, we’re missing our dog… and people were like, ‘Here’s my number. Call me and I will come help you find [her],’” dog mom Andrea Tankersley told . “The difficult part is she’s deaf,” dog dad Brennan Tankersley added. “So we’re calling out to her, calling out to her, of course knowing it’s not any good but you can’t help it.” Searchers reported hearing dog sounds but were unable to figure out where they were coming from. Two days later, city water crews homing in on her echoing barks located Zoey trapped in a muddy storm drain under a city street. A water department camera was set up to monitor Zoey’s condition in the tunnel as a herculean rescue effort coordinated by Arlington’s fire department, police, paramedics, and city workers was quickly mounted to free the trapped canine. Using jackhammers, pneumatic saws, and heavy equipment, in extreme heat conditions to break up the pavement and dig down to the concrete drain pipe below. Throughout the excavation, neighbors supplied workers with food and beverages to keep them going. Nearly 10 hours later, a section of the top of the culvert was lifted away to reveal the watery channel. Once they had access, rescuers still had to come up with a way to get Zoey safely out of the confined tunnel space. When one firefighter posed the idea of rolling her out on a skateboard, a kindergartener named Hunter volunteered his board for the cause. (The skateboard, autographed by the fire and police personnel who helped out in the rescue is set to be presented back to the little boy with a big thank you from everyone involved.) At 11 hours and counting, rescuers finally pulled Zoey from the concrete pipe to cheers and applause from an elated crowd of onlookers. The pooped pooch was passed, bucket-brigade style, up to the street where waiting emergency workers assessed her and then reunited her with the Tankersleys and their kids. Amazingly, although she was scuffed up and understandably distressed, Zoey suffered no major ill effects from her ordeal, and after getting an all-clear from the vet is happy to be back home. “It has been amazing,” Police officer Kristi Weil who was on the scene told WFAA. “Everyone has been so helpful. There have been cheers of joy and tears when Zoey was rescued… I love seeing the community turn out and cheer a successful end to this—and for a family to have their beloved pet returned to them at the end of the day.” We’re glad this doggone, dog-found deep-in-the-heart-of-Texas tale had a happy ending too.

"If you are forgetful or make mistakes when in a hurry, a new study from Michigan State University—the largest of its kind to-date—found that meditation could help you to become less error prone. The research tested how open monitoring meditation—or, meditation that focuses awareness on feelings, thoughts or sensations as they unfold in one’s mind and body—altered brain activity in a way that suggests increased error recognition. “People’s interest in meditation and mindfulness is outpacing what science can prove in terms of effects and benefits,” said Jeff Lin, MSU psychology doctoral candidate and study co-author. “But it’s amazing to me that we were able to see how one session of a guided meditation can produce changes to brain activity in non-meditators.” The findings suggest that different forms of meditation can have different neurocognitive effects and Lin explained that there is little research about how open monitoring meditation impacts error recognition. “Some forms of meditation have you focus on a single object, commonly your breath, but open monitoring meditation is a bit different,” Lin said. “It has you tune inward and pay attention to everything going on in your mind and body. The goal is to sit quietly and pay close attention to where the mind travels without getting too caught up in the scenery.” Lin and his MSU co-authors—William Eckerle, Ling Peng and Jason Moser—recruited more than 200 participants to test how open monitoring meditation affected how people detect and respond to errors. The participants, who had never meditated before, were taken through a 20-minute open monitoring meditation exercise while the researchers measured brain activity through electroencephalography, or EEG. Then, they completed a computerized distraction test. “The EEG can measure brain activity at the millisecond level, so we got precise measures of neural activity right after mistakes compared to correct responses,” Lin said. “A certain neural signal occurs about half a second after an error called the error positivity, which is linked to conscious error recognition. We found that the strength of this signal is increased in the meditators relative to controls.” While the meditators didn’t have immediate improvements to actual task performance, the researchers’ findings offer a promising window into the potential of sustained meditation. “These findings are a strong demonstration of what just 20 minutes of meditation can do to enhance the brain’s ability to detect and pay attention to mistakes,” Moser said. “It makes us feel more confident in what mindfulness meditation might really be capable of for performance and daily functioning right there in the moment.” While meditation and mindfulness have gained mainstream interest in recent years, Lin is among a relatively small group of researchers that take a neuroscientific approach to assessing their psychological and performance effects. Looking ahead, Lin said that the next phase of research—which has been published in —will be to include a broader group of participants, test different forms of meditation and determine whether changes in brain activity can translate to behavioral changes with more long-term practice. “It’s great to see the public’s enthusiasm for mindfulness, but there’s still plenty of work from a scientific perspective to be done to understand the benefits it can have, and equally importantly, how it actually works,” Lin said. “It’s time we start looking at it through a more rigorous lens.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/how-meditation-can-help-you-make-fewer-mistakes-2/
"A series of smuggled paleontological finds recovered in a 2013 police raid in Santos Harbor, Brazil, contain the most complete crested pterosaur skeleton ever found. Seized along with 3,000 other fossils destined for the illegal fossil trade, the skeleton opens a new world of understanding about these incredibly charismatic flying animals. Belonging to the species the animal had an enormous head crest that would put a cassowary to shame, and was preserved in limestone from the Early Cretaceous period, around 140 to 100 million years ago. Having to make it easier to hide, the limestone block containing the skeleton needed to be carefully reassembled, but eight years after being found, Victor Beccari and his colleagues at the University of São Paolo a full description of the dinosaur which may actually have been more like a peacock than an eagle. The head crest was extraordinary, and was preserved along with the skull and the soft hollow bones that normally make pterosaurs a poor candidate for fossilization. Typical of tapejarids, the animal’s group, sported a head crest half the size of its body, had a long neck and long legs, but short wings. Tupandactylus navigans.

Variant 1
. In a similar way to when the theory irritated an awful lot of schoolchildren in the late ’90s, the scientist from Brazil has a new theory on how the mighty pterosaur spent its days. “Pterosaurs were already mind-blowing before, but this new specimen, with its huge, awkward crest and long neck, is mind-boggling because—sort of like [flashy] peacock tails—they would have made him an attractive mate, but an easy target for predators and a poor flyer,” Beccari told . “Like the peacock, it probably spent its time eating fruit off the ground or using its long neck to grab food from higher bushes.” Scans of the nasal cavity the animal had adaptations for powered flight, suggesting the animal would only have used its wings in certain circumstances—to escape predators for instance. It seems appropriate, however, to compare the pterosaur to a peacock because after all, dinosaurs evolved into birds.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/a-brazil-police-raid-resulted-in-recovering-the-most-complete-pterosaur-skeleton-ever/
"In battling against the American homeless epidemic, it pays to think outside the box. The Tiny Home Village in Albuquerque isn’t just a place for someone to sleep out of the weather, it’s an occupational therapy project that helps the homeless reconnect with values and responsibility. Set up to cultivate a strong community, the power of routine, and a sense of pride in oneself and surroundings, the Tiny Home Village (THV) hopes that its residents will be better prepared for when they finally get off the street. The County of Bernalillo, New Mexico, secured a 30-year lease on a property owned by the Albuquerque Indian Center to build a walled and gated community of about 30 tiny houses that had doors which lock and climate control to give residents a strong enough sense of security and permanence that they could begin to really turn their life around. Albuquerque looked at a similar project in Oregon—the , which was established back in 2013, as a model for how to encourage self-governance among the villagers, allowing them to decide among themselves how the village is to be run day by day. The two look very similar. Inside the compound there are 30 houses painted different colors, though all featuring the same layout: a desk, two chairs, bed, closet, and stoop. At the center of the THV there is the “Village House” where residents can cook, do laundry, watch television, socialize, use the internet, and access a library. “We’re trying to give the villagers some tools that would stand them in really good stead once they do move out,” Ilse Biel, the resource manager for the Albuquerque THV, told Biel would add that already, the theory is working, and the community is taking ownership of daily chores as well as holding each other accountable. “They’re house-proud; really getting upset about seeing a counter not wiped, a cigarette butt somewhere.” is a welcome replacement for the previous homeless enclave—Tent City, which sprang up near a railroad in downtown and which became so big that the people there began to chalk addresses of their tents on the street. THV is not meant to be a place of refuge, and the doors aren’t open to just anyone. Perspective residents must sign up for a $30 a month utilities fee, as well test clean of any hard drugs. They must be sober for at least 10 days prior to the date of entry, and must be willing and able to participate in village life, which will require them to do chores like de-weeding in the communal vegetable garden, cleaning bathrooms, and more. : Perhaps for these reasons, THV is not yet full. But the managers are hopeful, believing such a community must be more than a just a roof over someone’s head and instead somewhere a person can make friends, and gain the physical, spiritual, financial, and occupational strength to ensure that by the time they rejoin society they are there to stay.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/tiny-home-village-in-albuquerque-new-mexico-for-homeless-people/
"Most tours across America tend to involve a long series of flights, or a road trip of 16-hour driving days plotting a course between as many national parks as possible in a camper van. The Great Loop, traversed by only 200 Americans per year, however, is another excellent way to see the country. A 6,000-mile journey circumnavigating the entire eastern United States and Canada, the journey ditches the car or the plane for the boat! It turns out that in 1898, three 18 year olds discovered that it was possible to, without ever going out to sea, travel from the Great Lakes region, out to the Thousand Islands past Montreal, before snaking down a myriad of canals, sounds, and waterways across the Mid-Atlantic, using Florida as a gateway to the Gulf of Mexico, where turning north, one can pass up the rivers of Central North America to return again to the starting line. It was in the time of the Founding Fathers that the Great Loop was envisioned. George Washington had an eye on connecting territories more easily across the vast and newly minted country. Many of the surveys he commissioned of canals and artificial waterways that make the Loop possible. However it wasn’t until Ken Ransom, a sailor who grew up faring the waves in Lake Michigan, that America’s great nautical maze was mapped. Departing in a sailboat built by himself and his two friends, he went the whole way, Like Ransom, sailors on the Great Loop today will tell you the challenges are part of the fun. Whereas most long nautical pleasure journeys typically take place in the ocean, the myriad of habitats one must navigate to finish the Great Loop make it a lot more special, and safer, while also presenting different challenges. Beautiful landscapes roll past you on the shores either side of your journey, such as the old city of Montreal, the Great Dismal Swamp, the Florida Keys, Virginia’s Ablemarle Sound, or the mountain-studded shores of Lake Champlain.

The Triangle Loop traverses Canada and the U.S. using the Hudson River as the start and finish, while passing the Eire Canal, Lake Champlain, Montreal, Lake Ontario, and the scenic Thousand Islands. Another Mini Loop is the Florida Loop, which passes Lake Okeechobee and the Atlantic Coast before arriving at the Florida Keys, up the Gulf to Pine Island, Fort Meyers, and Caloosahatchee Canal.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-epic-us-road-trip-of-6000-miles-of-wateryways-on-the-great-loop/
"An abandoned airport in Taiwan has been chosen as the stage for an exciting project in landscape architecture, blending green spaces with sensory experiences to create a refuge in one of the island’s biggest and most crowded cities. The Phase Shift Park in Taichung will include 200 different plant species, and 10,000 trees to shade residents from humidity, but the real spectacle will be 12 urban landscape installations, corresponding with the philosopher Rudolf Steiner’s ‘Principle of the 12 Senses’. Taichung’s air isn’t actually that bad, as most neighborhoods are labeled as “good” on the World Air Quality Index, however sitting just beneath of the Tropic of Cancer, and , one of the largest marine currents on Earth, the hot, humid, and sticky air can be stifling in the summertime, holding water vapor and toxic particulates from car exhaust down near the ground. The trees were chosen to offer maximum shade, and are built alongside winding lanes going from north to south, and through unique installations that play on Steiner’s senses of speech, taste, hearing, equilibrium, thinking, vision, movement, ego, touch, warmth, smell, and life. Passing through the park, there’s a lake designed specifically to create lifelike echoes, and a field of flowers cultivated specifically to envelope it with an intoxicating curtain of perfumes. Designed by French architecture firm the topography was carefully designed to maximize water permeation during the wet monsoon season. Underneath the soil lies complex that will ideally allow the rains to refuel the trees year-round. The concept art and preliminary images show a futuristic landscape rather than a natural oasis. It will do as much to bring tourists to the city as offer shelter, fresh air, and a play space for local residents. Steiner believed that the world was essentially an indivisible entity, and that it’s our consciousness which divides it into split realms of sensory experience. It’s a fascinating guide with which to experience something like a park, and one which speaks to the breadth of our potential to connect with nature even in somewhere as dense as the urban center of Taichung.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/phase-shift-landscape-park-in-taichung-offers-sensory-experience-and-respite/
"A rewilding revolution which took root 30 years ago in the English Midlands has branched out over 200 square miles, becoming one of the most successful efforts in Europe. The National Forest now consists of nine million trees spread across three counties, and links the ancient woodlands of Needwood, and Charnwood. Reforestation has exploded across Europe, the continent that’s lost more of its forests over the last 200 years than any other. Between 1990 and 2010, by 11 million hectares, or around 27 million acres, and just since 2015, €8.2 billion has been earmarked by governments for reforestation efforts. The significance of the National Forest comes partly from where it’s taken shape. The English Midlands is one of the West’s famous mining regions, like the Ruhr Valley or the Appalachians. The history of the towns in the counties of Derbyshire (D-Arbee-sher), Leicestershire (Less-ter-sher), and Staffordshire are entwined with an industry that gradually died off, leaving behind disused mining pits and quarries as stains on the landscape. Now such blemishes have been turned into green parks and nature reserves, and have been combined with the surrounding countryside, farmland, and existing woods to give England a wilder heart. It’s also opened the Midlands up to many new forms of income for locals in historic towns like Burton-upon-Trent and “Coalville.” Every year the National Forest hosts the , a three-day celebration of nature, wilderness, and quiet reflection. Many of the villages are connected by the a three-day walking tour that traverses the forest and its mosaic of landscapes from east to west. It’s also proving a success for England’s forest schools, a new form of intermittent schooling that teaches children about the woods, animals, the web of life, and more. moved into the National Forest in 2015, and is now teaching everyone from toddlers to high schoolers. The success of the National Forest has been so strong that the English government’s Department for Food, Economic and Rural Affairs of forest across Britain’s northeast, or the equivalent to 35 (English) football pitches.

"As city officials wrangle under the pressure to reduce urban violence and deal with demands from police unions, homeowners’ associations, and gun lobbyists, residents in some of the most violent neighborhoods in the country have opted instead to pull up a chair, and have a sit down. One such movement has been the 21 Days of Peace event in Minneapolis, a place where, even before the death of George Floyd, sometimes saw 11 homicides a month. Here, community and church congregation members are simply seating themselves in lawn chairs on street corners in the most dangerous neighborhoods, and acting as “violence interrupters”—and police statistics show it’s working. Compared to last summer, in June 2021 homicide numbers took a dive during the , and continued to stay low in the following months, along with incidents of rape and aggravated assault. “Our group asked the Minneapolis Police Department to identify the most dangerous spots in our neighborhood, the 4th Precinct, and then we went there, pulled out our chairs and sat down,” write Louis King and Jerry McAfee, in an King is president and chief executive of Summit Academy OIC in Minneapolis, and McAfee is pastor of the city’s New Salem Missionary Baptist Church, but both are part of this new wave of violence interrupters. “Too many leaders are responding by adopting a Nixonian ‘tough on crime’ stance—which usually translates into over-policing and under-supporting these communities,” they wrote. “The people sitting on these corners in their chairs are members of the community. We know our young people, and they know us.” Similar movements of violence interruption have broken out with success in Nashville, where the groups are working through community outreach to rebuild trust and using successful de-escalation to decrease crime by 40%, while arrests plummeted. AP reports that in the areas where the Dream Center operates, crime has fallen 40%, giving a totally new perspective to police departments that for years had adopted tough-on-crime policies. “We thought that was going to make it safer, and what we ended up doing was breaking down trust in those communities,” said police Lt. Jason Picanzo, who works with West Nashville Dream Center. Now, he says, it is the community that has made these neighborhoods safer. Back in Minneapolis, King and McAfee believe that the moral bastion of the Black Church gives them a unique advantage over the police forces. They site similar examples in where church groups are doing more for underserved communities, and at the same time reducing violence. “We draw on the power of congregation—of family, of friends, and of community to try to interrupt the violence. And our faith gives us the courage to put ourselves in harm’s way,” they wrote. It’s a strong gesture to unfold and lawn chair and simply sit where many people fear even to drive. Violence of any kind, whether it involves us or not, is a difficult situation to risk being caught up in, but desperate times also call on our ‘better angels’—and these Minnesotans are stretching their wings. “We’re not declaring victory, by any means. But as elected officials look for answers to end the violence, they would be wise to pull up a chair and take a look at what’s working.” :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/minneapolis-nashville-and-baltimore-violence-interrupters/

"Meet the man and jackdaw who have an adorable bond after a chance roadside encounter, and now even go on bicycle rides together. 55-year-old Michael Smith spotted an injured baby jackdaw lying on the roadside as he cycled home one evening in May. He scooped up the tiny bird, now named Patch, and took him home where he made him a little nest and fed him scrambled eggs. Now recovered, and about 16 weeks old, Patch has spread his wings, but comes back to his rescuer when Michael calls. Bird and man have such a close relationship that Patch gives his friend little beaky kisses and hitches lifts on his bike rides and walks. Patch has been a celebrity guest at a wedding, and Michael loves him so much he even slept rough one night when his feathered friend didn’t come out of a tree. Michael, an ex-builder from Malvern in Worcestershire, said, “I love nature and animals, so I couldn’t leave him injured in the hedgerow. “He’s like my best friend now, and I spend as much time with him as possible. When I’m without him I’m thinking about him, and when I see him again he does a little joyful squark that is different from his normal screech. He’s the best pet and everyone loves him. He is the talk of the town, and if I’m without him everyone’s asking after him.” Michael suspected Patch, who he thinks is a boy, had been attacked by another animal when he found him with a mangled wing. After living in an old pigeon box Michael got from a friend, and tucking into scrambled and boiled eggs, bread and milk, Patch took four weeks to recover use of his wing. Michael still feeds Patch mealworms, and fruit like cherries and grapes, but the now-recovered bird catches moths, wasps, and flies for himself. Patch lives in an aviary that Michael built in the garden, but comes in for play dates and occasional sleepovers in the house Michael shares with his mother 78-year-old mother Mary. Michael said, “People call me the bird whisperer, or bird-man of Malvern. It came quite naturally to me. And I remembered all these tales I’ve heard about people rescuing birds and forming a bond.” “He sits on my shoulder and puts his little beak to my face or gently nibbles my ear. He lets me stroke him under his breast and his feathers on his back all quiver. And he lets me rub his beak. He’s so much fun. “I was quite well known around here but I’m even more so now: it’s a lovely thing to be known for,” said Michael.

"An early Bronze Age log coffin containing the remains of a man buried with an axe thought to date from 4,000 years ago has been discovered accidentally on a golf course. The discovery of the coffin and its contents sparked a rescue mission funded by a £70,000 ($97,000) grant from Historic England and supported by a team of staff and students from the University of Sheffield’s Department of Archaeology working nearby who offered their assistance. The coffin, which is three meters long and one meter wide, was specially protected to ensure the delicate structure did not crumble after it was exposed to the sun and air. It was made from hollowing out a tree trunk, and plants were used to cushion the body, then a gravel mound was raised over the grave; practices that were only afforded to people with a high status within Bronze Age society. The remarkable find was made by chance during works to a pond at Tetney Golf Club in July 2018, during a spell of hot weather. The golf club’s owner, Mark Casswell, was put in contact with the Portable Antiquities Scheme and Historic England. Following a year of cold storage while being assessed, it was moved to York Archaeological Trust where it has been undergoing preservation work. According to the archaeologists, the axe seems more a symbol of authority than a practical tool, while the coffin gives an insight into how social hierarchy was marked out in the early Bronze Age. So far, yew or juniper leaves have been found within the coffin and further work is planned to discover more about how plants were used in this burial practice, and the time of year the burial took place. The axe is extremely rare, there’s thought to be only 12 known from Britain, especially because the wooden shaft survives as well as the stone head. The log-coffin was originally created by carving a large, single, fast-growing oak tree. It used ‘split timber’ construction technique, where the tree trunk was split lengthways first to create a half or slightly larger log for carving, rather than hollowing out a whole tree from scratch. It probably had a lid, of which part survives. There are around 65 early Bronze Age log coffins known from Britain as it is rare for them to survive, given they are made of wood. In this case a deep layer of silt aided its preservation. However, once the coffin was exposed it was a race to prevent its rapid deterioration. Tim Allen, of Historic England, said, “The man buried at Tetney lived in a very different world to ours but like ours, it was a changing environment, rising sea levels and coastal flooding ultimately covered his grave and burial mound in a deep layer of silt that aided its preservation. Mark Casswell, owner of Tetney Golf Club, added, “My family farmed here for years before we opened the Golf Course and I’d never have imagined that there was a whole other world buried under the fields. “It’s amazing how well preserved the axe is with its handle still there like it was made yesterday. We’ll have a nice photograph of it up on the Clubhouse wall, all those years that people have been living here working the land, it’s certainly something to think about while you’re playing your way round the course.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/a-rare-bronze-age-log-coffin-found/
"A team of investigators has succeeded in restoring brain trauma by hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This is the first time in the scientific world that non-drug therapy has been proven effective in preventing the core biological processes responsible for the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Using a specific protocol of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), cerebral blood flow (CBF) improved/increased in elderly patients by 16-23%, alleviating vascular dysfunction and amyloid burden. The study from Tel Aviv University, part of a comprehensive research program directed toward aging and accompanying ailments as a reversible disease, holds promise for a new strategic approach to the prevention of Alzheimer’s by addressing not only the symptoms or targeting biomarkers, but rather the core pathology and biology responsible for the development of the disease. Hyperbaric medicine is a form of therapy that requires patients to be kept in special chambers in which the atmospheric pressure is much higher than that normally experienced at sea level. In addition, they breathe air composed of 100% oxygen. Hyperbaric medicine is considered safe and already serves to treat an extensive list of medical conditions. In recent years, scientific evidence has indicated that unique protocols of hyperbaric therapy are capable of inducing repair of damage brain tissue and renewed growth of blood vessels and nerve cells in the brain. The first stage of the study, published in journal, was carried out on an animal model, in the course of which it was proven conclusively through examination of brain tissues that a certain therapeutic protocol brings about an improvement in vascular function and the creation of new blood vessels. It also prevents the deposit of new amyloid plaques on the brain cells and even leads to the removal of existing amyloid plaque deposits. Amyloids are non-soluble proteins. Deposits of such proteins in the brain are connected with severe degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. At the next stage, the effects of the treatment were examined for people above the age of 65 with cognitive decline, with an emphasis on memory loss, a stage preceding Alzheimer’s and dementia. The therapy included a series of 60 session of HBOT unique in pressure chambers over a period of 90 days. The effects on the brain were evaluated by high resolution perfusion MRI. The hyperbaric treatment protocol gave rise to: increased blood flow in the range of 16%-23%; significant improved in memory by 16.5% on average, significant improvement in attention and information processing speed. Dr. Ronit Shapira said, “The combination of an animal model from which we could learn the pathology of the disease, together with existing and available therapy, raises the hope that we will now be able to fight one of the greatest challenges to the western world. “According to our findings, hyperbaric therapy given at a young age is likely to prevent this severe disease entirely.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy-reverses-hallmarks-of-alzheimers/
"The world’s largest floating office building opens in the Netherlands, where unsurprisingly it will host the offices of the Global Center on Adaptation. Anchored in the harbor of Rijnhaven in Rotterdam, both office and organization will make a fighting partnership in the attempts to lessen the impact of climate change on our society, particularly in a country that’s below the level of the sea. Floating Office Rotterdam, or FOR, was recently inaugurated by King Willem-Alexander, and former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon who heads the team taking up residence in the (48,500 square-foot), three-floor office space. Built of prefabricated timbers arranged atop 15 custom built concrete pontoons, the upper floors feature wrap around terraces to enjoy the view of the city. An overhanging roof shades the interior from the sun. Powering FOR is an 800 square-meter array of solar panels hooked up to batteries ashore. It also uses the northerly waters of the Dutch harbor as a heat sink to regulate temperatures in the offices without using climate control. Finally the offices are fully recyclable after the materials are no longer safe for continued use. “We designed our floating office to reflect the values of its inhabitants: the Global Center on Adaptation,” writes the architects of the FOR. “This Rotterdam-based NGO… aims at promoting planning, investment, and technology to mitigate climate change. “The carbon-neutral building is designed to be climate resilient and will float if sea levels rise due to climate change. Our climate-resilient office is both an illustration of the center’s mission and sets an example for how to build sustainable floating structures.” The Global Center on Adaptation has a lease in the building for ten years, after which it will move to another tenant.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/worlds-largest-floating-office-opens-in-rotterdam/
"A company that GNN began supporting in 2017 when they were making fashion-forward scarves that filter the air at the level of N95 or higher, has gone above and beyond, producing a new single-use mask that closes the lifecycle loop for every wearer concerned about the environment—especially since the coronavirus has created so much landfill waste. The company, G95 (formerly Bioscarf) is so committed to sustainability, they began developing a special version of their filtration material after seeing the damage that discarded PPE was doing to our oceans since the pandemic began. Everything related to the newly developed mask—from the ear loops to the nose bridge—is made entirely using plant-based PLA materials which is 100% biodegradable. This includes the bags they ship in, the individual wrappers for each product, and the G95 filtration technology built-in. But how they’re “going beyond” is the best part. When you are done with the mask, instead of throwing it away, simply put it in the envelope that it arrived in, and mail it back to the company for free—and they will recycle them into new masks! If any of the masks do happen to reach the landfill or waterway, because they are 100% made out of plant-based materials, they will fully biodegrade in approximately 90 days. “Lab-tested & certified!” says the company’s founder, Carlton Solle, talking with GNN. “It’s the world’s first single-use mask made using 100% plant-based materials.” And they will give you a $1.00 store credit for every that you return for responsible disposal. Also, because Carlton and his co-founder, wife Hazel Solle, are serious about preventing masks from ending up polluting the ocean, you can send them used masks from ANY other manufacturers and receive a 25¢ in G95 store credit for each one shipped back. Insane brilliance, right? When you receive your shipment, carefully open it by using the tear strip on the back. Keep your bag because you’ll need it to mail back your used masks. At the end of each day, simply put your used mask into the bag, together with the wrapper it came in. When you have used up all of the masks, put them into the bag, place the enclosed mailing return sticker over the old sticker on the front of the bag. Be sure to fill out the enclosed card with your contact information and write in how many masks you are returning to receive the store credit mentioned earlier. “We’ve spent years developing these, and are really passionate about it,” says Solle. “Given the state of things, it will be a real game-changer.” During a business trip to China, Carlton Solle became ill, most likely due to complications related to air pollution. As an alternative to wearing an ugly mask to protect himself, . Back in Atlanta, his wife Hazel came up with the idea to design a product that would work both as a scarf and also a filter. (You might have seen the photo of our GNN founder wearing one during the wildfires in California when the air was so bad.) For people traveling outside the US, these masks are , and they have been submitted for FFP2 and CE registrations, so you can use them all around the world. Some European airlines may insist on FFP2-rated masks for boarding passengers. The company, G95, is currently shipping their products within 1-2 days for FREE—using USPS Priority Mail in the US—and they now over $100 FREE via UPS. If you enter the code at checkout you will get a 20% discount on any order over $100. The has a number of products that filter with their G95 technology, which they say is “like N95 on steroids.” Their hoodies and pullovers are designed to turn up to filter nose and mouth, and their gaiters and masks can be washed 50 times and still retain an N95 rating. They also have an informative . The is available now and sold in packs of 30 for $79 USD via the G95 website.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/plant-based-recycled-biodegradable-face-masks/
"Naturally regenerated forests are much better ways of achieving climate targets than mass planting, and Brazil could achieve 150% more reforestation if the forests are left to their own schemes. Home to a wealth of biodiversity that includes ocelots and golden lion tamarins, the Atlantic Forest biome is recognized as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and a Brazilian Natural Heritage site. However, it has lost nearly 80% of its original area due to logging and agricultural expansion, making it ideal for restoration initiatives, A report from finds that Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, the oft-ignored, great forest habitat in the country is a perfect site for natural reforestation. In a , seeking to map and quantify the potential for natural forest regeneration in the Atlantic Forests, the researchers found that of the current forest cover, which is around 34.1 million hectares (131,000 square miles) 8% was regenerated naturally between 1996 and 2015, but that another 20 million hectares could be reforested with a mix of natural and assisted strategies, between now and 2035, all the while saving around $90 billion in operation costs. The savings in dollars is key, since natural forest regeneration efforts of the total climate change funding in the world. Furthermore, tree planting and soil preparation between $1,400 and $34,000 per hectare. The Center for International Forestry Research feels the best bet for the world’s forests in a changing climate is to simply take our hands off the wheel. Several small examples of natural reforestation in Ireland and the UK, two nations keen on restoring past versions of their ecosystems, show the breadth of success one can have if one simply lets nature take its course. The rewilding project on the 3,500 acres of has created one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in lower England, while a 600 year-old 1,600 acre-estate in south Ireland has Natural regeneration has this potential, unsurprisingly, of restoring far more biodiversity, especially if helped along with seed dispersion, de-weeding, and other simple management strategies. A , when it looked at 133 papers on the topic and found that forest areas freed from agriculture and allowed to regenerate created 56% greater species richness in all categories of animals, and in five measures of vegetation structure: cover, density, litter, biomass, and height. “Instead of conserving with specific species in mind where you’re focusing on keeping a habitat, locking it down as it is, so that that preserves the numbers of certain species, what we’ve done here is just taken our hands off the steering wheel and just stood back and let nature take over,” said Isabella Tree, co-director of the rewilding project on the Knepp Estate. Another benefit is that naturally occurring forests trap far more carbon in the soil on average, as that regenerated forests absorb 32% more carbon above ground, and sequester 11% more below, than is generally estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. For these regenerated forests to last, however, the scientists and policy makers need to know the best way for locals and other interest groups to be motivated enough to leave the regenerating forests intact long-term. The article suggests that schemes like a payment system for rural dwellers who leave or protect and maintain stands of regenerated forests, or increased access to investment capital for agroforestry production, could be used to help convince those who rely on rural areas to leave the trees alone rather than turning them into wood chips.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/intead-of-mass-tree-planting-natural-regeneration-could-save-brazils-atlantic-forest/
"Way back in the mists of time, before Guttenberg’s printing press, before the Chinese invented parchment paper, before clay tablets and papyrus, humans passed information along through stories. It turns out those thousands of years of storytelling tradition may have actually altered our very biology, as a reveals that narrative stimuli, i.e. “Once upon a time,” or “My fellow Americans,” synchronizes the fluctuations of heart rates between the individuals listening. Human hearts don’t beat in perfect rhythm. Depending on a person’s level of physical fitness, fluctuations and variability in the regularity of those beats at rest can actually measure almost entire seconds. As strange as it sounds that a speaker and listeners’ hearts literally beat as one, further findings from the study reinforce the idea of storytelling as a biological determiner. For example, the matching of heart rates is determined by the attention paid by the listener to the speaker, and that this phenomenon predicts the memorization of the narrative content. This isn’t the first time this incredible connection with stories has been demonstrated to have a biological impact on humans. It’s that the brains of people watching films together tend to “tick collectively,” suggesting why films can be so enjoyable as a group activity, and why the greatest films affect us the way they do—because they are literally changing our biology into “pay attention and remember” mode. In the heart rate experiment, subjects were presented with a 1 minute audiobook snippet of Joules Verne’s . They found that there was significant correlation of heart rate synchronicity between subjects. To control for error, they gave all the subjects different 1 minute sections, and as predicted, the heart rate synchronicity dropped significantly. This explains why story time is such an effective teaching tool for kids. Distractions were found to disrupt this synchronicity, specifically when during the narrative stimuli, participants were asked to repeatedly count backwards. Most people can probably remember a live performance that held them in a spell, when the instruments were perfectly mixed, or the orchestra was in perfect harmony with the conductor. It’s pretty astonishing to imagine what’s really going on in that concert hall: all the musicians are playing in perfectly synchronized rhythm according to the time signature of the piece, and all the notes are matched identically along an almost infinitely-sensitive scale of frequencies, while all the brains of all the audience members are “ticking over” the same, and all their hearts beat collectively down to razor-thin differences. Essentially, all humans become one large organ of perfect order.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/narrative-stimuli-synchronize-the-heart-beats-of-those-listening-to-stories-or-music/
"In the classic Dr. Seuss children’s book, , lazy bird Mayzie finagles hapless Horton the Elephant into sitting on an egg she’s too bored to hatch while she flies off to Palm Beach for a frivolous vacation. Says Horton to Mayzie: “Me on your egg? That doesn’t make sense. Your egg is so small, ma’am, and I’m so immense.” But being the faithful elephant he is, he sits down to get the job done nonetheless. When a similar scenario recently unfolded in the upstate New York town of Geneseo, a sizable Doberman Pinscher named Ruby—who was nursing six of her own puppies at the time—had no qualms about adding a tiny newborn kitten whose mother was nowhere to be found to her hungry brood. Ruby’s owner Brittany Callan breeds Dobermans on her family’s farm. Even though the breed is best known for being consummate guard dogs, when she happened on the lost kitty, her thoughts turned to Ruby, whose pups were less than a week old. After a careful introduction, the infant cat Callan had named Ramblin’ Rose settled in next to her adoptive siblings for a feed and Ruby was only too happy to accommodate the extra little mouth. “[Ruby] took right to her and didn’t seem to mind at all,” Callan told , adding, “She grew up with small animals [and learned] to be nice and just lick them and be friendly with everything… She’s just an extremely, extremely compassionate dog.” While the occurrence of interspecies nursing is rare, it’s certainly not unprecedented. Back in 2012, two abandoned were adopted by a Shar-Pei named Cleopatra at a Russian zoo in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Two years later, a determined farm feline from County Offaly, Ireland took on three motherless ducklings and raised them as kin along with her kittens. Unprecedented or not, Callan believes Ruby’s über-developed maternal instinct is something truly special. “She was meant to be a mother to anything,” Callan told the . “We’ve had baby bunnies, guinea pigs, chickens, ducks… Ruby licks them like she’s cleaning them, like she’s their mother.” Since taking over mom duties for Ramblin’ Rose, Ruby has started carrying the kitten around by the scruff of the neck and protectively separating her from her puppy litter mates when their behavior gets too rambunctious for the itty-bitty kitty. Under Ruby’s loving care—with a little extra nutrition in the form of kitten formula administered by Callan—Ramblin’s Rose’s weight has gone from 4.37 ounces to 7.27 ounces in the span of one week. When Horton’s egg finally hatches at the end of his tale, the creature that emerges is part bird and part elephant. Her impressive growth rate notwithstanding, it’s not likely Ramblin’ Rose will catch up with her adoptive mom’s stature or take up barking—but she might just make someone a pretty fierce guard cat when she’s fully grown.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/doberman-dog-nurses-tiny-abandoned-kitten/
"A premature baby born the size of a bag of sugar and kept alive in a sandwich bag has defied the odds to start elementary school. Darcey Clegg, who is now four years old, weighed just 1lb 5oz when she was born in September 2016 via an emergency c-section—three months early. The little girl had to fight for her life in the neonatal unit at Royal Oldham Hospital, Greater Manchester, until she miraculously came home on 30th December after 64 days in hospital. Now despite everything, she is getting ready to start school in September, and mom, 50-year-old Gill Glegg, couldn’t be prouder. Gill, who works as a carer, said, “Darcey is amazing. She was so tiny in that little sandwich bag, I didn’t know if she would make it. “It’s so emotional to see her start school. We’ve got her uniform and everything ready to go.” Gill’s pregnancy was smooth sailing until a scan at 28 weeks revealed her baby was not receiving enough blood and there was a placental abnormality. She was immediately rushed to Royal Oldham Hospital for an emergency operation. “It was terrifying,” Gill said. “I wasn’t given much hope that she would make it. But she came out crying.” Darcey was immediately taken to the neonatal intensive care unit to help her survive the crucial early months. She battled blood transfusions and had to build up strength before she could come home in time for New Year’s Eve. “She was the best present,” Gill said. Since then Darcey has defied the odds to be a normal healthy girl. “She started walking a bit late, but it was an amazing moment,” Gill said. “She is a dream.” As for Darcey, she can’t wait to go to school, saying, “I can’t wait to go and play with lots of other kids.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/premature-baby-born-the-size-of-a-bag-of-sugar/
"An Apple co-founder is launching a company to clean up space debris, and not a moment to soon, as NASA estimates there may have been 27,000 pieces of junk floating or hurtling around the Earth last year. With thousands of additional satellites slated for placement around the Earth as part of future plans for universal internet connectivity, the job to tackle the growing orbital refuse must fall to someone. The company, called Privateer Space, has nothing to do with piracy, and is in fact in “stealth mode,” and as such we know little about it.

"Rather than give in to depression, one man chose to fight back in a way that not only changed his own life for the better—it gave a stranger he’d never met a second chance as well. Gage Tappe had recently moved to Idaho and had part-time custody of one of his kids. Alone and isolated, he admits he was at an “all-time low.” Looking for something to help him cope with his sadness and feel more connected, Tappe signed up as a donor with the national bone marrow registry. “I felt like my life wasn’t worth very much, so I hoped that I gave myself a chance to put some value to my own life by trying to help somebody extend theirs and continuing to stay on the list… and you have to be alive to do that,” Tappe correspondent Carson Daly. “It gave me a sense of value to myself that I didn’t previously have.” Several months later, Tappe got a call to let him know he’d been identified as a match. Tappe says since he was raised to help others in need, in any way big or small, he just needed to know where and when his marrow could be harvested for the transplant. The donation was made anonymously. The identity of the recipient didn’t matter to Tappe, the only thing he cared about was being able to have a meaningful and positive impact on someone’s life—but neither he nor the woman his bone marrow was going to could know just how life-changing his donation would turn out to be. By the time Tia Jensen was diagnosed with leukemia in 2018, she’d already been dealing with the effects of multiple sclerosis for two decades. For this latest health hurdle, she started a course of chemotherapy at the Seattle Cancer Center Alliance and added her name to the waiting list for a bone marrow donor. After the successful transplant procedure, Jensen was stunned to learn that not only had her leukemia gone into remission, but thanks to her newly revitalized immune system, the multiple sclerosis she’d been battling for 20 years was in remission as well. Ecstatic, Jensen wanted to reach out and thank her donor. Two years and many letters later, Jensen was eventually given Tappe’s contact information and the two struck up a correspondence. Though delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, they finally met in person on the set of The TODAY Show. “I have been wanting to meet [him] for so long… I missed meeting Gage because of the pandemic. And I realized that because of Gage, there’s a lot of milestones that I won’t miss. I’m alive. I’m here. I’m going to get to be with my family, to be in the memories,” Jensen told TODAY’S Sheinelle Jones. A grateful Jensen sees Tappe as a true role model. To honor him, and so that more patients might enjoy recovery stories with similar happy outcomes, Jensen has teamed up with for an online donor registration event in hopes of inspiring others to follow his example of getting tested and stepping up to donate if and when they’re matched. She has high hopes for the initiative. “I think we forget too often how kind and big-hearted people are. And I am so grateful that [Gage] was willing to just be brave and take that step and share this kindness and marrow and give me a second chance at life,” she told Daly. “All this was done not knowing a thing about me, and I am just floored by the charity and the beauty in that.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/man-gives-bone-marrow-depression-ms-goes-gage-tappe/
"Big old trees. Are there any living things that speak to us the same way as big old trees? Italy has ensured through law that every Italian and visitor to the country has the right of happening upon the oldest, gnarliest, and most storied trees in the nation, and thereby having that wonderful feeling of discovery and reverence we get from seeing an ancient tree. The law of the was passed way back in the 20th century, and protected —beech, oak, pine, olive, cypress—from harm. The 1939 law described monumental trees as “immovable things that have remarkable characteristics of natural beauty,” which as Elisabetta Zavoli writing for explains, gave a visual emphasis on what was already a vague categorization for the law. One of the most important aspects of monumental trees is not their beauty, but their effect as micro-ecosystems. Their hollows, scars, dead branches, and living ones all play host to a wide variety of species like insects, mushrooms, birds, and small rodents. Signs of damage or decay, while hardly being pleasing on the eye, provide vital nutrients and shelter for the forest animals, such that in 2013 a better, more representational definition of a monumental tree was passed into Italian law. It’s a good thing too, as many of the monumental trees Zavoli highlights didn’t become monumental for their beauty, but for their age. The olive tree in the village of Villastrada in Umbria could be 2,500 years old, but it isn’t exactly a looker. Its principal trunk has long since decayed, and other younger trunks have grown over its lifespan. Another example is the Pontone beech tree in Abruzzo, which is actually seven beech trees fused together, wrapped in the same layer of bark. Since 2013, over 3,000 new entries have joined the national monumental tree registry. Some are treasured for their beauty, others for their age; yet more are valued for the legend and myth surrounding their lives. The 800-year-old Cypress of Saint Francis is said to have been planted when, returning from a walk, Saint Francis of Assisi tried to burn the walking stick he had just used. When it failed to catch fire, he decided to plant it instead, allegedly saying “If you do not want to burn, grow up!” The cones that fall every year from that tree, located in a convent, are gathered in the hopes that pilgrims who can manage to grow something from its seeds will have a blessed tree.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-25000-monumental-trees-of-italy-are-old-habitats-shrouded-in-legend/
"Cozying up in a warm fleece blanket after a day on the slopes is a lovely feeling; cozying the slopes up in a fleece blanket, as it turns out, can also be an excellent way to keep snow and ice from melting high in the Swiss Alps. While making something cozy under a blanket isn’t exactly how one would first think to keep something cold, it’s protecting Switzerland’s vulnerable glaciers from the summer sun by reflecting the rays away . The 3,238-meter (10,623-ft) Mount Titlis has seen large portions of its glacial coverage disappear over the last few decades, and ski resort employees who rely on the glaciers to keep the snow thick and crisp for winter holidays work for 4-6 weeks securing blankets to give the ice rivers all the help they can get.

"There’s never been an insult to convey a greater misconception than the phrase ‘bird-brained’, because our feathered friends routinely use their high levels of intelligence, and soar to surprising heights demanding admiration. Take Bruce for example, the 8 year-old Alpine parrot from New Zealand. Bruce is missing the top half of his beak and is considered disabled, but that doesn’t stop him from doing all the things a normal parrot does. He has adapted to use his tongue in place of the missing upper beak to lift tools, and, most notably, to grasp a pebble to clean dust and mites from between his feathers—something never before observed in the species. Alpine Kea are the world’s only alpine-dwelling parrots, and they’ve been known to be ‘bird-brained’ in this new sense. They’re very pensive, and have even been shown to weigh up probabilities before making a decision. : Bruce was found at Arthur’s Pass on the South Island in 2013 when he was a juvenile. Scientists at the South Island wildlife hospital assume he lost his beak during an encounter with a pest trap. Now housed at the Willowbank Wildlife Reserve, he was first observed using a pebble in lieu of his beak for preening purposes back in 2019, a behavior so extraordinary that a group of scientists set out to observe him. They that in 90% of instances where he grabbed a pebble, he used it to preen himself, which constitutes tool usage in animals. In 95% of instances when a pebble was dropped, he retrieved or replaced it to continue grooming himself, seriously ruling out the ‘fooling around behavior’ . Amalia Bastos had the fortune of observing this “big personality” for the research, and she about the experience. “Because Bruce’s behavior is consistent and repeated, it is regarded as intentional and innovative,” Bastos said. “It is Bruce’s own unique tool-use, and this is the first scientific observation of that.” : “He’ll pick up a piece of carrot and push it against a hard piece of metal or rock and use that to scrape with his lower bill, which again is a feeding behavior we haven’t seen in the other birds.” The green and red birds have been documented to use sticks to clean themselves before, but lacking the dexterity the rest of his beak would have afforded him, Bruce has had to make do. : SEE it in action in the video below… (NOTE: Audio is only music so feel free to mute.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/disabled-parrot-cleans-himself-using-pebbles/

The next stop after gathering samples of Jezero will be the ancient lake’s fan-shaped delta, a class of landscape where life would explode with diversity and prosperity—at least on Earth. It holds one of the best chances we’ll have for finding microbial lifeforms. The delta could potentially contain clay, which rapidly entombs organic material. If there is any clay, there might be remains of life. : Another opportunity will be the carbonate rocks, which have been located in Jezero using Mars orbiter data, and which on Earth to exquisitely preserve organic structures such as seashells. Perseverance is planned to study the geography of Mars as it travels along for a year or two, before depositing its samples back at the landing site, where a fetch rover, which could launch as early as 2026, will have to retrieve them.

I believe this will be especially true for you in the coming weeks. (PS: writes, “Any level of biological organization that we examine, from DNA up to the most complex body systems, shows the capacity for self-diagnosis, for removal of damaged structure, and for regeneration of new structure.”) SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Research suggests that most people think everyone else has more fun than they do. But I’m guessing that only a small percentage of Sagittarians feel that way. You tend to be extra alert for fun, and you have intuitive skill at tracking down fun. In addition, you often take the initiative to precipitate fun. You understand you have a responsibility to generate fun, and you have a talent for generating it. All these capacities will serve you well in the coming weeks. I recommend you raise your mastery of the art and science of having fun to a new level. Be the Champion of Fun and Games for your entire circle. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): I’m not engaging in empty flattery when I say that you are unlike anyone else who has ever lived in the history of the world. Your absolute uniqueness is a fundamental fact. Maybe you don’t reflect on this truth very often. Perhaps you feel that it’s not helpful to think about or that it’s irrelevant to your daily decision-making. But I propose that in the next three weeks, you give it a central place in your understanding of your destiny. Allow it to influence everything you do. Make it a major factor in your decision-making. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Welcome back from the underworld, Aquarius. I hope your time wandering through the maze-like twilight brought you as many fascinating mysteries as confusing questions. I trust you took advantage of the smoky riddles and arresting dilemmas to fortify your soul’s wisdom. I suspect that although your travels may have at times seemed hard to fathom, they have provided you with a superb education that will serve you well in the immediate future. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): In ‘s novel , the lead character says to a friend, “You filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life.” Is there a person who might inspire you like that, Pisces? Maybe a person from your past with whom you’ve fallen out of touch? Or is there a person hovering on the outskirts of your life who could stimulate you to have such feelings? Now is a favorable time to seek these influences. I advise you to be bold in your quest to associate with allies who will stimulate your lust for life and teach you crucial lessons. (PS: For extra credit, make abundant use of another theme from Wilde’s book: “The search for beauty is the real secret of life.”) ARIES (March 21-April 19): “Books are mirrors: You only see in them what you already have inside you,” wrote author . Let’s take that a step further: “Other people are mirrors: You only see in them what you already have inside you.” And even further. “The whole world is a mirror: You only see in it what you already have inside you.” Have fun playing with these meditations, Aries. The coming weeks will be a fertile time to explore how thoroughly your experiences reflect the activity transpiring in your own brain. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Some spiritual teachers say things like “I am not my body” or “This body is not me.” I don’t understand that. It’s an insult and disparagement. It’s dismissive of our bodies’ sublime beauty and our bodies’ inspired role in educating our souls. I agree that we are not ONLY our bodies. I agree that a part of us is eternal, not confined to flesh and blood. But hell yes, I am my body. You are your body. It’s a glorious aspect of who we are. It’s a miraculous creation that has taken millions of years to evolve into the masterpiece it is. So yes, you are your body, and yes, this body is you. I hope you love your body. Are in awe of it. Are pleased to be inside it. If anything is lacking in this department, now is an excellent time to make corrections. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): “I know someone who kisses the way a flower opens,” wrote poet . I’d love for you Geminis to have that experience. The astrological omens suggest it’s more likely than usual to occur sometime soon. Other experiences with a better-than-average chance of unfolding in the coming days: allies who speak of intimate subjects in ways that resemble a flower opening; partners who co-create with you in ways that resemble a flower opening; spiritual helpers who offer guidance and help in ways that resemble a flower opening. CANCER (June 21-July 22): “I lie to myself all the time, but I never believe me,” writes Cancerian author . Ha! As a Cancerian myself, I confess to the same crime. But I am looking forward to a shift in the coming weeks. I suspect we Crabs will be inspired to cut way back on the fibs we try to get away with. You know what that means, right? We’ll be more inclined to trust ourselves, since we’ll be more likely to tell ourselves the truth. Our decisions will be shrewd, and our self-care will be rigorous. Hallelujah! LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): My object in this is to stimulate your imagination in ways nobody else in your life will. You need an influence like me, from outside your inner circle, to administer friendly, playful shocks to jolt you out of habitual ways of thinking. Here we go. 1. If you were to stow seven parts of your soul in seven objects, what objects would they be? 2. If you could change one thing about your past, what would it be? 3. If you were a character in a fairy tale or a movie, who would you be? 4. If you could travel to a place that would teach you what you most need to know, where would it be? 5. If you had a magical animal as your special ally, what animal would it be? 6. If you could sing a song with uncanny healing power for someone you care about, what song would it be? 7. If you could improve your relationship with some part of your body, what would it be?

"Un bote lleno de turistas vio la película de la naturaleza de su vida, justo frente a sus ojos. Un pingüino papúa que estaba siendo perseguido por una manada de orcas dio un salto desesperado en busca de seguridad a su bote. El salto exitoso ocurrió sólo después de un primer intento fallido, cuando el pequeño animal se lanzó de cabeza al costado del bote y rebotó de nuevo en el agua peligrosa. El bloguero de viajes Matt Karsten y su esposa Anna estaban haciendo un recorrido por los icebergs del estrecho de Gerlache en la Antártida, cuando vieron cómo se desarrollaba la increíble persecución. En el siguiente video, el salto que salvó vidas ocurre en el minuto 2:00, terminando la larga escena de persecución … Esta no es la primera vez que los humanos han estado en el lugar correcto en el momento adecuado para ayudar. Una nutria en Halibut Cove estaba en problemas similares y nadó frenéticamente hacia la seguridad mientras la orca la seguía. : Llegó al bote de John Dornellas y subió a la popa justo cuando la orca se acercaba.

"Las personas que viven en los barrios marginales de la costa de Chile tienen toda el agua que podrían necesitar, pero no pueden beberla porque es demasiado salada. También hay abundante energía solar aquí, pero nada para aprovecharla. Ahora, un finalista del Lexus Design Award 2021, , ha creado algo que aprovecha estos dos abundantes recursos: un dispositivo de iluminación con energía solar que desaliniza el agua. El agua potable es escasa para las 110.000 familias de la zona y la energía llega a través de líneas eléctricas poco fiables. Las ventanas a menudo están tapiadas para aumentar la privacidad y la seguridad, lo que elimina casi toda la luz natural. «Quería lograr un diseño que fuera sostenible, pasivo y creara una característica sorprendente dentro de la casa del asentamiento oscuro», Goglau, un neozelandés que se graduó de la Real Academia Danesa con una maestría, especializado en arquitectura para condiciones extremas. «En mi proceso de desarrollo, se hizo evidente que podía abordar la falta de iluminación interior y acceso al agua mediante la creación de un tragaluz híbrido y un dispositivo de desalinización solar». El dispositivo de Goglau puede purificar 440 mililitros de agua al día, y la salmuera sobrante se tamiza en baterías hechas de zinc y cobre donde alimentan una tira de LED para usar durante la noche. Durante el día, la luz funciona con un pequeño panel solar, y todo es barato de fabricar. No solo se enfoca en la función, sino que el tragaluz de desalinización solar también se modela de tal manera que utiliza el proceso químico de evaporación y condensación para crear patrones de iluminación relajantes en las paredes y el piso a medida que los fotones se mueven a través de gotas de agua, vapor y ondulaciones. en la sombra estilizada. : Empleado ahora como arquitecto en GXN, Goglau no sabe si ganará el premio Lexus, como uno de los seis finalistas, pero su invento, con la ayuda de organizaciones benéficas locales, entre los hogares informales de la ciudad chilena. de Antofagasta.

"Mil millones de años de movimientos geológicos de la Tierra se han resumido en un video de 40 segundos, en el que los continentes y océanos revolotean como mariposas amorosas mientras demuestran cuán móvil es realmente la superficie de la Tierra. La historia de la tectónica de placas, el deslizamiento y deslizamiento de la corteza terrestre y los continentes, ha tenido lugar durante miles de millones de años a velocidades entre la tasa de crecimiento de las uñas (40 mm por año) y del cabello (160 mm por año). El demuestra no sólo cuánto se suman los milímetros con el tiempo, sino que retrata una teoría en la evolución de la Tierra, desde el período supercontinente de Gondwana hace 540 a 320 millones de años, hasta la configuración moderna, el Aparente Polar Wander, en el que la mayoría las masas de tierra se han arrastrado hacia el Polo Sur antes de condensarse en un punto central y volver a subir juntas como si fueran forzadas a través de un embudo. El coautor del , el Dr. Michael Tetley de la Universidad de Sydney, dijo a Euronews: «Por primera vez se ha construido un modelo completo de tectónica, incluidos todos los límites». “En una escala de tiempo humana, las cosas se mueven en centímetros por año, pero como podemos ver en la animación, los continentes han estado en todas partes en el tiempo. Un lugar como la Antártida que hoy vemos como un lugar frío, helado e inhóspito, en realidad alguna vez fue un buen destino de vacaciones en el ecuador”, agregó. La teoría principal que explica el desplazamiento de estos continentes es que, como una tapa de alcantarilla flotando sobre un torrente de agua en una calle inundada, la corteza terrestre es mucho más rígida y tiene más resistencia mecánica que la astenosfera debajo de ella. A medida que la roca caliente y quebradiza se desplaza en la astenosfera más débil, su movimiento a través de la parte inferior de la litosfera crea una presión que hace que esta última se mueva. A medida que las placas tectónicas que forman la litosfera se mueven, el desgarro indiscriminado y el choque entre sí crean algunas de las características más dramáticas de nuestro planeta, como cadenas montañosas, volcanes, trincheras y plataformas submarinas e incluso océanos. : El coautor, el Dr. Sabin de la Universidad de Sydney, dijo en un : “El planeta Tierra es increíblemente dinámico, con la superficie compuesta de ‘placas’ que constantemente se empujan entre sí de una manera única entre los planetas rocosos conocidos. Estas placas se mueven a la velocidad de crecimiento de las uñas, pero cuando mil millones de años se condensan en 40 segundos, se revela una danza fascinante». “Los océanos se abren y se cierran, los continentes se dispersan y se recombinan periódicamente para formar inmensos supercontinentes”, añade. Zahirovic y sus compañeros de equipo esperan que el modelo que han creado ayude a los científicos planetarios en todo tipo de investigación, desde predecir dónde se producirá el aumento del nivel del mar con mayor fuerza hasta predecir dónde se pueden encontrar grandes depósitos de cobre.

"“Life is a practice in improv,” says a Quebec college senior who won a scholarship for her candid musings on the theme ‘How the coronavirus affected my final semester.’ The contest, sponsored by greatergood.org, invited high school and college seniors to record a selfie video that answers the question: How did the coronavirus change your senior year? Participants included 379 students worldwide in 49 countries, but it was a 19-year-old film student who stole the hearts of judges in The “Class of 2020” Challenge. Graduating from John Abbott College, April Judd used humor and creative edits to depict what life was like moving back in with her family and missing the chance to say goodbye to all her friends at the arts college. Her inspiring message details how the class of 2020 can use this experience to their advantage and “mold the universe into the future they want to see”. The pandemic of crisis actually caused April to see the beauty in what our world is going through. “I don’t want to go back to the way things were… I want to have a heightened appreciation for all the things that make life full.” : The Shawville, Quebec graduate told GNN, “In the chaos that our world is experiencing right now, it’s really easy to get caught up in the negative.” “Listening to other people’s submissions and hearing about the unique experiences other girls have gone through this year as graduates is inspiring.” “We are all, truly, in this together and we are all capable of change and growth that can only make this world a better place,” she added. : Patricia Cogley, Director of GreaterGood.org’s Girls’ Voices media training program, which is active in 20 countries and hosted the contest, said: “For many college and high-school seniors in the graduating class of 2020, the coronavirus pandemic has dramatically changed their final year. But, true to our mission, Girls’ Voices gave young women around the world the opportunity to showcase their creativity, resilience, and ideas for a better future, despite this challenging and unprecedented time.” Not just graduates, anyone can draw inspiration from April’s uplifting message, which won her the $1,000 cash scholarship.

"From the hearth and home, to farm and family, to business and betterment, human beings can pick up and accumulate concepts—sometimes very fundamental ones about what is most important—from other people, adopting them without scrutiny. Imposing these external ideals or concepts onto how we live our own lives, raise our kids, or manage our business, can often mean we are leading someone else’s life. Redefining things like happiness, wealth, and success—as oriented through our own compass—is the ultimate way we can live our best life. “Scarcity economics teaches us that it’s a race—it’s a race to get there first, to have the highest score, to achieve the most, to learn the most first—and we have that same problem around how we treat ourselves and it’s why we have this overwork epidemic.” Holding a Ph.D. in sustainable agriculture, and the record for the most swimming holes visited in a single day in her home of rural West Fulton, New York, Shannon Hayes is the owner of and is the host of podcast, a weekly exploration of the adventures of keeping life, business, family, community, and fun in balance.

"Human society is filled with value, and we can place value on almost any object or opportunity. Viewing the financial system through the lens of permaculture, Ethan Rolland identifies which, when contemplated as a whole, gives us a clearer understanding of our net worth—not just in dollars. We can all learn to utilize our eight forms of capital, our unique currencies: financial, material, living, social, intellectual, experiential, spiritual, and cultural. Using the analogy of an ecosystem, Ethan says, “Your capital isn’t necessarily a currency. Capital is the root, and currency is the derivative we use to exchange… By exercising capital, you extract a currency that then complexes to a real thing or effect in the world… So with social capital, the currency is connections. It complexes to influence and relationships.” A well-known expert in permaculture, homesteading, and general self-reliance, works to provide every possible resource for those looking to increase their self-reliance, whether that’s building a homemade aquaculture pond in your backyard, learning how to link up with local farmers and artisans, or how to become an expert at foraging for wild plants and mushrooms. Nearing episode 3,000, features guests, essays, and other content regarding the bottomless well of information in the space of homesteading and permaculture.

"Jeff Bezos has placed an additional $1 billion into the Bezos Earth Fund to be spent on creating, expanding, managing, and monitoring protected and conserved areas of wilderness. The money will take the form of grants to organizations working to preserve lands and secure Indigenous people’s rights in the Congo, tropical Andes Mountains, and across Oceania. The latest pledge is on top of the ten-thousand millions he’s already devoted towards combating climate change more directly, with nearly one-thousand of those millions having already been distributed as grants. “When people hanker for the good old days and glamorize the past, they’re almost always wrong. By most metrics, life is better than it was in the past,” Bezos said in a statement. “But there is a notable exception—the natural world is not better today than it was 500 years ago, when we enjoyed unspoiled forests, clean rivers, and the pristine air of the pre-industrial age.” The first round of grant money went mostly to large, well-organized global conservation names like the WWF. However the Amazon founder isn’t just throwing money around. Unsurprisingly, the man who transformed global e-commerce has a larger plan. Research that if governments simply recognized all existing Indigenous land claims, it would be the single largest conservation victory since the invention of the national park. The regions is looking to preserve are, to use the parlance of a famous television conservationist, “chock-a-block” with Indigenous groups. “Conservation is one of the most effective anti-poverty strategies we have,” United Nations Deputy Secretary-General I warmly welcome this generous commitment, which will help deliver the Sustainable Development Goals.” : “We can and must reverse this anomaly,” Bezos added. “By coming together with the right focus and ingenuity, we can have both the benefits of our modern lives and a thriving natural world. I hope this commitment inspires others to make their own pledges to protect and conserve nature and help in the fight against climate change.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bezos-earth-fund-pledges-one-billion-to-help-conserve-nature-in-congo-andes-and-pacifc/
"An endangered turtle that washed up in Ireland with hypothermia has been returned to its native Canary Islands on a flight—and even had its own boarding pass. The three-year-old Loggerhead sea turtle, known as Julius Caesar or ‘JC’, was discovered on the beach in County Donegal, but has boarded a flight to much warmer waters. Airline Aer Lingus teamed up with Exploris Aquarium, where the the reptile has been living for the last three years, to fly him to Gran Canaria for his release. Aer Lingus pilot, Captain Peter Lumsden, said: “It is our pleasure to welcome aboard a very special passenger today and to ensure the safe transportation of JC the Turtle to Gran Canaria. “Since they first got in contact, Aer Lingus has worked closely with the team from Exploris Aquarium and our Maintenance & Engineering and Ground Operations teams to ensure that all JC’s needs are met as we complete this important mission. Keeping the turtle’s temperature above 19 degrees is critical to his wellbeing and he requires regular monitoring and shell lubrication so placing him in the aircraft hold was not an option. His specially designed crate was securely strapped across a number of seats in the cabin. In January 2019, weighing a few hundred grams, nine-month-old JC is thought to have gotten caught up in the wrong current and swept along the Gulf Stream. Loggerhead turtles are endangered and are happiest in warmer climates, so the chilly waters of the North Atlantic put JC’s life in danger. Fortunately, he was discovered by a local family and taken to Exploris Aquarium in Portaferry, County Down, to recuperate in a tropical tank with tasty snacks of fish mixture and squid. The pandemic prevented him from his repatriation for three years, however on September 15 the now-25kg reptile was packed into a waterproof crate and boarded flight EI 782 from Dublin to Gran Canaria. He was accompanied by his minder Portia Sampson, who ensured he was safely passed over to the Centro de Recuperación de Fauna Silvestrede Tarifa on arrival. Less than 24 hours later, JC became fully acclimatized to his new home and was released back into the sea. Aer Lingus previously transported another rogue loggerhead turtle, Leona, to Las Palmas, Gran Canaria in December 2014 after she was discovered in County Clare. Loggerhead turtles are a vulnerable and endangered species and their numbers are in decline in the wild. According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) they are “the living representatives of a group of reptiles that has existed on Earth and traveled our seas for the last 100 million years.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/endangered-turtle-joins-flight-from-ireland-to-native-canary-islands/

"Expert firefighting, contingency planning, and gallons upon gallons of water mean that the stands of giant sequoia trees in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains appear to be safe for future generations. The September 9th “Windy Fire,” started by a lighting strike, burned 25,000 acres in Peyrone Sequoia Grove and the Red Hill Grove before it converged on Sequoia National Park. There, firefighters wrapped many of the famous trees such as “General Sherman” the largest tree on Earth by volume, in fire-resistant foil capable of withstanding 1,200°F. “The fortunate thing is the Park Service has done a lot of prescribed burning in [the park] since the 1960s, and so it’s making their job a lot easier,” Jon Wallace, a chief firefighter said . “There’s also a myriad of walking trails in there, which have given firefighters places to work off of,” he added. “The structures in the Giant Forest, the museum, all the infrastructure around the General Sherman tree, that’s all got sprinklers on it, and firefighters are running those sprinklers pretty much nonstop to make sure everything stays wet. But right now, all the protection efforts in the Giant Forest are going really well,” he said. A trip to Sequoia National Park teaches one that the giant conifers actually withstand fires very well, and many of those whose count of years stretch into the thousands would have endured many fires. Their bark, like a giant spongy blanket, can be 32-inches thick, and protects them from the flames. The trees actually need levels of heat which only a fire can generate to release the seeds stored in their cones. In practice then, sequoias are literally born in flames. However with year after year of California drought conditions mixed with predictions that weather events like fires will become more severe with climate change, it pays to be safe, and , more than 600 firefighters were battling the blaze at one point, most of them working within the Trail of 100 Giants grove.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/firefighters-wrap-fire-resistant-foil-around-sequoias-as-wildfire-is-brought-under-control/
