"A landfill of 42 million tires in the sands of Kuwait is finally being cleaned up and recycled. This news in itself would be a major relief to locals who have to suffer from the clouds of black smoke arising during fires. But the government isn’t stopping there. They are aiming to create a green city of 25,000 homes in line with a post-oil Persian Gulf, with a focus on sustainability and tourism. The first step is to clear the ground. The Salmiya area, nicknamed “Rubber Mountain,” consists of hundreds of small ziggurat-like mounds of spent tires—a reaction from the one million cars which were added to Kuwait’s roads over the decade. EPSCO Global General Trading has opened a recycling facility for the tires, where they’ve been collected, shredded, and pressed into other materials like tiling and playground flooring. The plant opened in January of 2021, and has high hopes for exporting the recycled material out to nearby gulf neighbors. In their place will be South Saad Al-Abdullah City, a green city characterizing a new era in the Middle-Eastern country. “We have moved from a difficult stage that was characterized by great environmental risk,” Oil Minister Mohammed al-Fares. “Today the area is clean and all tires have been removed to begin the launch of the project of Saad Al-Abdullah city.” Expected to cost €3.3 billion and require 30 years to complete, the city hopes to feature green technology presumably like the kind one can see in other cities on the Persian Gulf, both existing and not. Saudi Arabia is a zero-emissions, car-less future city that’s centered around access to big data rather than water or crops.

"If you feel like you’re hoarding plastic containers in your home, you’re not alone. A new poll found 62% of Americans surveyed would rather keep them for possible reuse than throw it away. The study asked 2,000 adults about their plastic habits and what they’d like to improve. Over half (55%) said they’d rather keep plastic containers and other plastic wares, rather than throw them away. Half of respondents keep a bag stuffed with plastic bags in their house. 44% say they have a kitchen drawer with plastic cutlery. 39% have a cabinet full of mismatched Tupperware, and almost one in five have a cabinet storing old jars (18%). Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of , the results also found that 55% don’t want to throw out plastics in their home without reusing them. In fact, sixty-four percent of respondents said they never need to buy Tupperware, because they have plenty of other containers they’ve saved. Three in five said they always try to make a conscious effort to repurpose or upcycle items. They ask themselves “Can this be recycled?” an average of four times a week and end up tossing another four items in the recycling bin that they’re not even 100% certain can be recycled. “It’s common to feel that you might not be making a difference by recycling, but it’s important to remember you are,” said a spokesperson for Core Hydration. : “Choosing products made with recycled materials is a simple step in the right direction and keeps the plastic within the circular economy,” they added. The survey also asked for examples of how people had been repurposing items. One respondent said they were growing garlic inside cut-off water bottles. Plastic jugs are also being reused as pots for plants. 1. Created an original piece of rustic artwork to pep up a bare wall by repurposing wooden window shutters. 2. Growing garlic in cut-off water bottles. 3. Having saved quite a few big coffee containers, I use them for cat litter in winter, for birdseed, and the grandkids like to use them to dig in the garden with. 4. Those round plastic lids from toddler food pouches are good for lots of things, teaching kids colors, sorting, and even stacking to build towers. 5. I have turned old frames into jewelry hangers and bottles into flower pots and candle holders. 6. I repurposed a foam egg crate from my new bed, turning it into a bed for my dog. 7. I reuse glass yogurt containers for individual dessert cups/servings. 8. Turned a ladder into a bookshelf. 9. Taking plastic jars, removing labels, painting and decoupage them into attractive vases or pencil holders or decorated for use for cotton balls, etc. :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/americans-hoard-plastic-containers-rather-than-tossing-onepoll/
"A design for plastic bottles that can be linked together has caught on as a revolution in disaster relief. Called Friendship Bottles, they have been used to construct small dining cabins that are also able to withstand Category 2 storm winds. Among the most common resource shipped on pallets to disaster-stricken areas is water. If that water were to arrive in Friendship Bottles, those whose houses were destroyed could use them to create a temporary shelter. This function of use as sustenance-shelter is a no-brainer, according to the inventor of the Tim Carlson. Carlson had been developing the design for the bottles for a decade before COVID-19 hit his home state of New York. But when he was seeing all the makeshift outdoor seating arrangements making his way to the pandemic-hit city, he realized it was the perfect opportunity to test his design. According to , he contacted Peaches Kitchen & Bar and teamed up to of Friendship Bottles with wooden support beams. Along with being quite a striking atmosphere to sit inside, because they acted like a big prism from passing cars, the cubbies stood up to the storms that recently smashed the Big Apple, proving the concept as a disaster-ready building material. Through a partnership with the Center for Architecture Science and Ecology, Friendship Bottles are being compared to other shelters used by the Red Cross and Red Crescent, including the scenarios and logistics of disaster relief efforts that might use them as delivery containers for water and subsequently as building material. Elsewhere, plastic bottles are also being made into homes and shelters that are proving to be both bulletproof and earthquake resistant , where they are filled with sand and pressed together with readily available mud. Friendship Bottles require no mortar or wire of any kind, offering a different kind of solution. One thing the Friendship team feel they have as an advantage is that there are far fewer limits on what can be assembled using the bottles after they are emptied. Rather than a prefabricated shelter with instructions, the bottles can be turned into bricks, which can then be made into anything.

"Manchester City are the reigning champions of the English Premier League, and now they’re championing the cause of landfill waste by offering edible coffee and tea cups at their 55,000 seater Etihad Stadium. After suffering a reversal at the hands of London’s Tottenham Hotspur F.C. on the opening weekend, seven days later they played their first home match of the season, drumming Norwich City 5-0 while producing 0 pounds of disposable hot drinks cups—a plague in a tea/coffee loving country where a staggering 2.5 billion disposable cups are used every year. “For the first time on Campus, an ‘edible coffee cup’ will also be introduced. This fantastic and innovative solution provides an amazing solution to waste, just eat your cup,” reads a from the Etihad Stadium. The cup is made by a Scottish startup , and is essentially a 100-calorie vegan biscuit in the shape of a cup. Made with wafer in much the same way as an ice cream cone, the cup will stay leak-proof for 12 hours, and even more amazingly, crunchy for a full 45 minutes, which for the American readers is exactly and always one-half the duration of a ‘football’ match. According to the company’s website, the cup is fully recyclable, but the taste of coffee-soaked wafer cup is actually delectable. The football club is also offering fully recyclable beer cups made of recycled paper and cardboard. There are with making a fully recyclable paper takeaway hot drinks cup, and it’s why there still isn’t one today in the largest beverage chains. The combination of a heatproof inner lining and paper together make the cups very tricky to recycle, as the two very different materials must be separated. Edible cups truly might be the best solution, provided firms like BioBite can bring the cost-per-unit down. 240 of their biscuit cups cost $111 before VAT, about 14 cents more than for the cup, the plastic lid, and the wood stirrer. Other firms are closer to the mark, like Bulgarian edible coffee cup maker , who make (including taxes) wafer cup with about the same properties as BioBites. For eco-conscious consumers, the lack of lid is not an issue provided they enjoy the coffee on foot. It’s well-suited to European city centers made for walking about, but rather inconvenient in most of America, set up as the country is for driving. Another limiting factor is that a wafer is not exactly the fuel of a healthy society. If there were a company that could make the wafers out of some kind of vegetable fiber, something many western diets are nutritionally deficient in, then you’re talking about a real revolution.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/manchester-city-stadium-offers-edible-hot-beverage-cups/
"There may be a thousand ways to say, ‘Happy Birthday!’ but the sweetest of all may very well be a special chocolate message that was recently served up by an amazingly thoughtful restaurant staff. Creating natal felicitations in warm liquid cocoa was nothing new at London’s Luciano by Gino D’Acampo restaurant, but for birthday girl Natalie Te Paa, who is totally blind, the best wishes were spelled out in Braille. What gave the message an even greater meaning was that there was no advance planning involved. When the restaurant crew learned the dinner Te Paa was sharing with friend Claire Sara was a birthday celebration, they took it upon themselves to find and recreate the Braille translation that summed up their best wishes in well-chilled chocolate. Te Paa could barely believe her fingertips as she traced over the raised confectionary dots. “My mind was blank for a second and then I was like, ‘Is this in Braille?’” Ta Paa told . “I’ve never had anything happen like that before. It was wild. They just really did go above and beyond.” Dinner companion Sara recorded Te Paa’s delighted reaction to what had become a very different kind of surprise party and posted the jubilant footage to TikTok. I’ll never forget this moment. While restaurant manager Giovanni Galluccio maintains the impromptu gesture was simply part of the customer service they strive to extend to all their patrons, clocking in with close to 16 million views to date, the internet judged the extraordinary act of kindness extra special. As Te Paa told TODAY, “The fact that people have responded so much and so well to it just shows how much the world needs kindness right now, how much the world needs a message of hope, needs to see people doing things and going above and beyond for each other.” “So take heart despite how broken the world is right now,” the viral video caption reads, “true kindness still exists.” To paraphrase M&M’s iconic tagline—that’s one message sure to “melt in your hearts, not in your hands.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/restaurant-braille-chocolate-cake-natalie-te-paa/

"Our partner Rob Brezsny provides his weekly wisdom to enlighten our thinking and motivate our mood. Rob’s , is a syndicated weekly column appearing in over a hundred publications. He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Happy Birthday sometime soon, Libra! As gifts, I have collected six useful mini-oracles for you to meditate on during the rest of 2021. They’re all authored by Libran aphorist Yahia Lababidi. 1. Hope is more patient than despair and so outlasts it. 2. Miracles are proud creatures; they will not reveal themselves to those who do not believe. 3. A good listener is one who helps us overhear ourselves. 4. One definition of success might be refining our appetites, while deepening our hunger. 5. With enigmatic clarity, life gives us a different answer each time we ask her the same question. 6. Temptation: seeds we are forbidden to water, that are showered with rain. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Pioneering psychologist wrote, “I must also have a dark side if I am to be whole.” But it’s important to add that some dark sides tend to be destructive and demoralizing, while other dark sides are fertile and interesting. Most of us have a share of each. My reading of the planetary omens suggests that you Scorpios now have extra power to upgrade your relationship with the fertile and interesting aspects of your dark side. I hope you will take advantage! You have a ripe opportunity to deepen and expand your wholeness. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Sagittarian poet was a complicated person with many mysterious emotions and convoluted thoughts. And yet, he once wrote that life occasionally brought him “boundless simplicity and joy.” I find it amazing he could ever welcome such a state. Kudos to him! How about you, dear Sagittarius? Are you capable of recognizing when boundless simplicity and joy are hovering in your vicinity, ready for you to seize them? If so, be extra alert in the next two weeks. I expect there’ll be a visitation or two. Maybe even three or four. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): was not a 21st-century New Age self-help teacher. He was a 17th-century Jesuit philosopher born under the sign of serious, diligent Capricorn. I hope you will be extra receptive to his advice in the coming weeks. He wrote, “Know your key qualities, your outstanding gifts. Cultivate them. Redouble their use.” Among the key qualities he gave as examples were disciplined discernment and resilient courage. I bring his thoughts to your attention because the coming weeks will be a rousing time to heed his counsel. It’s time for you to identify and celebrate and give abundant expression to your key qualities. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): After studying the genes that create feathers in birds, scientists found that humans have all the necessary genes to grow feathers. (I read about it in magazine.) So why don’t we grow feathers, then? Well, it’s complicated. Basically, the feather-making genes are not fully activated. Who knows? Maybe someday, there’ll be technology that enables us to switch on those genes and sprout plumage. In the coming weeks, it might be fun for you to imagine having bird-like qualities. You’re entering a high-flying phase—a time for ascension, expansion, soaring, and seeing the big picture from lofty vantage points. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Are there experimental approaches on the frontier of your desires that would be intriguing to consider? Might there be lusty experiences you’ve barely imagined or don’t know about—but that could be fun to play with? According to my analysis of the astrological omens, the coming weeks will be a favorable time to explore such possibilities. Be safe and prudent, of course. Don’t be irresponsible or careless. But also be willing to expand your notions of sensuality. ARIES (March 21-April 19): Aries author says, “The best way to love someone is not to change them, but instead, help them reveal the greatest version of themselves.” If that strategy appeals to you, the next eight weeks will be an excellent time to put it to maximum use. You’re entering a phase when you can have an especially beneficial effect on people you care for. You’ll be at peak power to help them unleash dormant potentials and access untapped resources. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): It’s a good time to ruminate about things you wish could be part of your life but aren’t. You will be wise to develop a more conscious relationship with wistful fantasies about impossible dreams. Here’s one reason why this is true: You might realize that some seemingly impossible dreams aren’t so impossible. To get in the mood for this fun exercise, meditate on a sample reverie: “I wish I could spend a whole day discovering new music to love. I wish I owned a horse and a boat and a vintage brown and orange striped bohemian cardigan sweater from the 1970s. I wish I knew the names of all the flowers. I wish I felt more at ease about revealing my hidden beauty. I wish I could figure out how to eliminate unnecessary stress from my life.” GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Poet, essayist, and translator calls her husband Robert Currie the “Randomizer.” His role in her life as a creative artist is to make quirky recommendations that help her avoid being too predictable. He sends her off in directions she wouldn’t have imagined by herself. Here’s an example: At one point in her career, Carson confessed she was bored with her writing. The Randomizer suggested, “Let’s put dancers into it.” In response, she repurposed the sonnets she had been working on into a live theatrical performance featuring many dancers. I think you would benefit from having a Randomizer in your life during the coming weeks. Know anyone who could serve? If not, look for one. Or be your own Randomizer. CANCER (June 21-July 22): If you so desired, you could travel to Munich, Germany and eat beer-flavored ice cream. Or you could go to Rehoboth, Delaware and get bacon-flavored ice cream. If you were in Taiwan, you could enjoy pineapple shrimp ice cream, and if you were in London, you could sample haggis-flavored ice cream, made from sheep innards. But my advice right now is to stick with old reliables like chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry ice cream—which are still delicious even if they’re not exotic. What’s my reasoning? In general, the astrological aspects suggest that during the coming weeks, you’re most likely to thrive on trustworthy standbys and experiences you know and trust. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Celebrated novelist (1775–1817) wrote, “Sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to describe them in.” People who aren’t as articulate as Austen experience that problem even more often than she did. But the good news, Leo, is that in the coming weeks, you’ll be extra skillful at expressing your feelings and thoughts—even those that in the past have been difficult to put into words. I invite you to take maximum advantage of this grace period. Communicate with hearty poise and gleeful abandon. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): “When you know what’s important, it’s a lot easier to ignore what’s not,” writes author and life coach Marie Forleo. Let’s make her thought the basis of your work and play in the coming weeks. Get vibrantly clear on what is of supreme value to you, which influences bring out the best in you, and which people make it easy for you to be yourself. Then compose a second list of trivial situations that are of minor interest, influences that make you feel numb, and people who don’t fully appreciate you. Next, Virgo, formulate long-term plans to phase out the things in the second list as you increasingly emphasize your involvement in the pleasures named in the first list.

"Five environmental partners celebrated the largest dam removal in Kentucky’s history last week, which will not only restore biodiversity and improve ecosystems but also prevent deadly accidents in the future. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service partnered with The Nature Conservancy, Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, and Kentucky Waterways Alliance to push for the removal of lock and dam No. 5 from the Green River near Roundhill. The Green River is one of the most biodiverse rivers in the country. It is home to more than 150 fish species, more than 70 mussel species and 43 endemic species that exist nowhere else in the world. Aquatic species include nine endangered mussel species, one endangered fish, and one endangered freshwater shrimp—the Kentucky cave shrimp. Officials at a ceremony September 20 extolled the benefits of the dam removal that will make the river safer for people, healthier for fish and mussels, and an economic boon to local communities. “We are excited to partner with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and The Nature Conservancy on the removal of Green River Lock and Dam 5,” said Louisville District Commander Col. Eric Crispino during the ceremony. “This project will restore the natural flow to this portion of the Green River, the most environmentally diverse river in the inland navigation system, as well as support our ecosystem restoration mission.” : The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service continues to lead the $4.6 million project where crews have been deconstructing the structures on site since June 2021. Work is expected to be completed in October, and The Nature Conservancy will take ownership of the site. “Removing Lock and Dam number five on the Green River is a really big deal,” said David Phemister, state director for The Nature Conservancy in Kentucky. “This is not just an ecological victory, but this is really a victory for river access and the local economies. We’re committed to working with the local community, Butler County and others to make sure this is a public park accessible to all.” Green River Lock and Dam No. 5 was built in 1933-34 for commercial use, but the Army Corps ceased operation of the structure in 1951 due to it no longer being needed. The structure has stood unused for 70 years, creating a pooled condition in the river with lower oxygen levels, more sediment and higher temperatures—all issues for aquatic life and the overall health of the river. The dam also presents a barrier to boat traffic and recreation, with no portage or bypass options. : Once the dam is removed, it will restore free-flowing conditions to 73 miles of the Green River. There are many Green River species that thrive in moving water. These include many aquatic insects that serve as food for foraging bats, including three bat species that are endangered. It will also improve safety and access for recreational canoeists and kayakers and overall fishery including highly sought-after gamefish such as smallmouth bass, rock bass, and muskellunge. : “This project illustrates the concepts of partnerships and revolutionizing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, two priorities of the Chief of Engineers,” Crispino said. “The Louisville District is proud to be part of the partnership and we look forward to seeing the Green River free flowing again soon.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/dam-removal-on-kentucky-green-river/
"In the classic Dr. Seuss children’s book, , lazy bird Mayzie finagles hapless Horton the Elephant into sitting on an egg she’s too bored to hatch while she flies off to Palm Beach for a frivolous vacation. Says Horton to Mayzie: “Me on your egg? That doesn’t make sense. Your egg is so small, ma’am, and I’m so immense.” But being the faithful elephant he is, he sits down to get the job done nonetheless. When a similar scenario recently unfolded in the upstate New York town of Geneseo, a sizable Doberman Pinscher named Ruby—who was nursing six of her own puppies at the time—had no qualms about adding a tiny newborn kitten whose mother was nowhere to be found to her hungry brood. Ruby’s owner Brittany Callan breeds Dobermans on her family’s farm. Even though the breed is best known for being consummate guard dogs, when she happened on the lost kitty, her thoughts turned to Ruby, whose pups were less than a week old. After a careful introduction, the infant cat Callan had named Ramblin’ Rose settled in next to her adoptive siblings for a feed and Ruby was only too happy to accommodate the extra little mouth. “[Ruby] took right to her and didn’t seem to mind at all,” Callan told , adding, “She grew up with small animals [and learned] to be nice and just lick them and be friendly with everything… She’s just an extremely, extremely compassionate dog.” While the occurrence of interspecies nursing is rare, it’s certainly not unprecedented. Back in 2012, two abandoned were adopted by a Shar-Pei named Cleopatra at a Russian zoo in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Two years later, a determined farm feline from County Offaly, Ireland took on three motherless ducklings and raised them as kin along with her kittens. Unprecedented or not, Callan believes Ruby’s über-developed maternal instinct is something truly special. “She was meant to be a mother to anything,” Callan told the . “We’ve had baby bunnies, guinea pigs, chickens, ducks… Ruby licks them like she’s cleaning them, like she’s their mother.” Since taking over mom duties for Ramblin’ Rose, Ruby has started carrying the kitten around by the scruff of the neck and protectively separating her from her puppy litter mates when their behavior gets too rambunctious for the itty-bitty kitty. Under Ruby’s loving care—with a little extra nutrition in the form of kitten formula administered by Callan—Ramblin’s Rose’s weight has gone from 4.37 ounces to 7.27 ounces in the span of one week. When Horton’s egg finally hatches at the end of his tale, the creature that emerges is part bird and part elephant. Her impressive growth rate notwithstanding, it’s not likely Ramblin’ Rose will catch up with her adoptive mom’s stature or take up barking—but she might just make someone a pretty fierce guard cat when she’s fully grown.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/doberman-dog-nurses-tiny-abandoned-kitten/
"Have a minute? Try sitting still and watching the second hand of a clock as it sweeps its way around the dial. Feels like a long time, doesn’t it? Now, picture waiting for something to arrive, not for an hour, not for a day, but for 100 years. An eternity, right? Now imagine what it must feel like for that century-long wait to finally be over. Awesome and then some, of course, and it’s the very reason Hidilyn Diaz, a 30-year-old weightlifter from the Philippines was over the moon when, with her final dramatic lift of the competition, she won the first-ever gold medal for her homeland after a 100-year Olympic drought. The Philippines has been sending teams to the Summer Olympics since 1924. Over the course of ensuing competitions, Filipino athletes have historically scored 10 medals, but the gold remained elusive. (Diaz herself won a silver in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro games.) Training throughout the pandemic has been rough, but for Diaz, the challenges she faced were tougher than most. Stranded by COVID-19 travel restrictions, Diaz was unable to see her family for more than a year. To top that off, she lacked proper training equipment and was forced to improvise—but she persevered. Coming as she did from an economically challenged childhood, the lessons Diaz learned early in life about self-sufficiency and resilience certainly stood her in good stead during the ordeal she endured leading up to the games. A Reddit discussion chronicles the many obstacles Diaz had to overcome just to get to Tokyo, and how she repeatedly rose to the occasion. “The most amazing thing about her story is that she got stuck in Malaysia during the COVID lockdown. She was only there for an Olympic qualifying event when the government banned traveling and she ended up being stuck there for more than a year. I read she had to build her own workout equipment using water jugs,” one Reddit commenter reported. “And despite all that, [she] and her team were running online seminars at the same time in exchange for donations. They used the funds they raised to help get basic necessities like groceries to people back home in the Philippines who were having trouble during the lockdown,” another enthused. To win the gold, Diaz needed to take down the 2019 world champion, China’s Liao Qiuyun, who’d earned an impressive overall score of 223 for her three lifts. But Diaz proceeded to set a new world record with a clean and jerk of 127 kg (about 280 lbs), taking her cumulative total to 224 and cinching the top honors in the event. Realizing what she’d just accomplished, an ecstatic Diaz was overcome with emotion. Tears flowed freely as she took the podium and saluted the Filipino flag while the country’s national anthem played. “We are so proud to see our motherland’s flag raised at the Olympic podium and we are deeply thankful to Hidilyn Diaz for bringing the first gold medal to the Philippines,” Brendan Flores, president of the National Federation of Filipino American Associations told . As proud as her country is of her, for Diaz, the feeling is more than mutual. She sees her win as a “golden opportunity” to inspire other up-and-coming Filipinos to set their sights high, to work hard, and to never give up. “I am thankful that God is using me to inspire all the young generation and all the Filipino people to keep fighting during this pandemic,” she said in a statement reported by WaPo. “To all the young generation in the Philippines, please dream high… That’s how I started. I dreamed high and finally, I was able to do it.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/philippines-olympics-first-gold-100-years/
"Drinking and driving don’t mix when the alcohol is inside the driver, but what if the leftover dregs from a whiskey distillery could replace the fuel inside the tank? Whiskey is a potent potable that’s fueled many things—rebellion, imagination, and some pretty epic hangovers. Now, it is powering the huge tractor-trailer trucks that deliver the Glenfiddich Scotch itself. A fleet of low-carbon trucks powered by biomethane will be soon carrying Scotland’s iconic whiskey, thanks to a partnership between Glenfiddich and a sustainable transportation company. According to the company, IVECO, their natural process is simple: Distillery waste materials are run through an anaerobic digester. As they break down, gases are emitted and harvested. After a final cleaning process, the resulting product is a low-carbon, low-particulate biofuel. “It has taken more than a decade for Glenfiddich to become the first distillery to process 100% of its waste residues on its own site, then to be the first to process those residues into biogas fuels to power its trucks, and finally to be the first to install a biogas truck fueling station,” said Kirsty Dagnan, from the distillery’s Dufftown facility, . It’s estimated that every green and white “Fuelled by Glenfiddich” truck on the road will displace up to 250 tons of CO2 every year. In addition to producing eco-friendly petrol, the distillery is using the leftover solids from the fuel processing as fertilizer in the fields used to grow barley, the main ingredient in whiskey. As an added bonus, not only do these twice-over leftovers enrich the soil, they actually draw CO2 away from the atmosphere. According to figures forecast by Glenfiddich’s parent company, William Grant & Sons, when compared to diesel and other fossil fuel alternatives, their innovative “closed-loop system” is set to cut annual greenhouse gas emissions by up to 99%—an equivalent environmental impact of planting 4,000 trees every year.

"A premature baby born the size of a bag of sugar and kept alive in a sandwich bag has defied the odds to start elementary school. Darcey Clegg, who is now four years old, weighed just 1lb 5oz when she was born in September 2016 via an emergency c-section—three months early. The little girl had to fight for her life in the neonatal unit at Royal Oldham Hospital, Greater Manchester, until she miraculously came home on 30th December after 64 days in hospital. Now despite everything, she is getting ready to start school in September, and mom, 50-year-old Gill Glegg, couldn’t be prouder. Gill, who works as a carer, said, “Darcey is amazing. She was so tiny in that little sandwich bag, I didn’t know if she would make it. “It’s so emotional to see her start school. We’ve got her uniform and everything ready to go.” Gill’s pregnancy was smooth sailing until a scan at 28 weeks revealed her baby was not receiving enough blood and there was a placental abnormality. She was immediately rushed to Royal Oldham Hospital for an emergency operation. “It was terrifying,” Gill said. “I wasn’t given much hope that she would make it. But she came out crying.” Darcey was immediately taken to the neonatal intensive care unit to help her survive the crucial early months. She battled blood transfusions and had to build up strength before she could come home in time for New Year’s Eve. “She was the best present,” Gill said. Since then Darcey has defied the odds to be a normal healthy girl. “She started walking a bit late, but it was an amazing moment,” Gill said. “She is a dream.” As for Darcey, she can’t wait to go to school, saying, “I can’t wait to go and play with lots of other kids.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/premature-baby-born-the-size-of-a-bag-of-sugar/
"Physical activity does the brain good. Not only does it reduce depressive symptoms, it actually fosters the brain’s ability to change and adapt. This dual beneficial effect of physical activity was reported by researchers at Ruhr-Universität Bochum in Germany following a small study. “The results show how important seemingly simple things like physical activity are in treating and preventing illnesses such as depression,” says study leader associate professor Dr. Karin Rosenkranz. People with depression often withdraw and are physically inactive. To investigate the effect of physical activity, Karin Rosenkranz’s working group enlisted 41 people for the study, all of whom were undergoing treatment at the hospital. The participants were each assigned to one of two groups, one of which completed a three-week exercise program. The program, which was developed by a sports science team at the University of Bielefeld, was varied. It contained fun elements, and did not take the form of a competition or test, but instead required teamwork from the participants. “This specifically promoted motivation and social togetherness while breaking down a fear of challenges and negative experiences with physical activity—such as school PE lessons,” explains Karin Rosenkranz. The other group took part in a control program without physical activity. The study team ascertained the severity of the depressive symptoms, such as a loss of drive and interest, lack of motivation and negative feelings, both before and after the program. The brain’s ability to change, known as neuroplasticity, was also measured. It can be determined externally with the help of transcranial magnetic stimulation. “The ability to change is important for all of the brain’s learning and adaptation processes,” explains Karin Rosenkranz. The brain’s ability to change is lower in people with depression than in healthy people. After the program of physical activity was completed, this ability to change increased significantly and achieved the same values as healthy people. At the same time, depressive symptoms decreased in the group. The more the ability to change increased, the more clearly the clinical symptoms decreased, according to Rosenkranz, and these changes were not so pronounced in the group who took part in no physical activity. Though physical activity had an effect on symptoms and the brain’s ability to change, the doctor could not say to what extent the changes are causally linked, based on this study, which was published in June 2021 in the journal . “It is known that physical activity does the brain good, as it, for instance, promotes the formation of neuron connections, adds Rosenkranz. “This could certainly also play a role here.” So, next time you’re feeling low, it’s worth it to try and move your body, to change your brain.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/physical-activity-depression-ruhr-university-bochum/

"Two Indiana boys riding their bikes past a funeral ceremony for a military veteran last week and immediately pulled over. Jacqi Hornbach was in the Batesville neighborhood when the boys got off their bikes, dropped their backpacks and stood in solemn formation.

"Australian researchers discovered a potentially life-saving treatment for heart attacks inside a very unlikely source–the venom of one of the world’s deadliest spiders. A drug candidate developed from a molecule found in the venom of the Fraser Island (K’gari) funnel web spider can prevent damage caused by a heart attack, as well as extend the life of donor hearts for organ transplants. The discovery was made by a team led by Professor Peter Macdonald from the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute in Australia and colleagues at The University of Queensland. Macdonald said this incredible result had been decades in the making: “This will not only help the hundreds of thousands of people who have a heart attack every year, it could also increase the number and quality of donor hearts, which will give hope to those waiting on the transplant list.” Dr Palpant, from UQ’s Institute for Molecular Bioscience (IMB), said the drug candidate worked by stopping a ‘death signal’ sent from the heart in the wake of an attack. “After a heart attack, blood flow to the heart is reduced, resulting in a lack of oxygen to heart muscle. The lack of oxygen causes the cell environment to become acidic, which combine to send a message for heart cells to die.” “Despite decades of research, no one has been able to develop a drug that stops this death signal in heart cells, which is one of the reasons why heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the world.” : Dr. Palpant tested the drug candidate, a protein called Hi1a, using beating human heart cells exposed to heart attack stresses to see if the drug improved their survival. “The Hi1a protein from spider venom blocks acid-sensing ion channels in the heart, so the death message is blocked, cell death is reduced, and we see improved heart cell survival.” There are currently no drugs in clinical use that prevent the damage caused by heart attacks. “The survival of heart cells is vital in heart transplants—treating hearts with Hi1a and reducing cell death will increase how far the heart can be transported and improve the likelihood of a successful transplant,” said Macdonald. “Usually, if the donor heart has stopped beating for more than 30 minutes before retrieval, the heart can’t be used – even if we can buy an extra 10 minutes, that could make the difference between someone having a heart and someone missing out. For people who are literally on death’s door, this could be life-changing.” : The small protein in the venom of this spider was shown to markedly improve recovery from stroke, “amazingly reducing damage to the brain even when it is given up to eight hours after stroke onset,” said UQ Professor Glenn King. “For heart attack victims, our vision for the future is that Hi1a could be administered by first responders in the ambulance, which would really change the health outcomes of heart disease.” This would particularly important in rural and remote areas where patients are far from hospitals—when every second counts. This could also allow donor hearts to be transported over longer distances and therefore increasing the network of available donors and recipients. Dr. Sarah Scheuer says their research, published , initially just looked just at the effect of venom but moved down a whole new path of discovery when they identified a specific pathway that played a key role in damaging the heart tissue after oxygen loss. “We found that an acid-sensing ion channel played a significant role in causing injury to the heart. By blocking that channel, we were able to prevent some of the injury that usually occurs.” : The protein has been tested in human heart cells, and the team is aiming for human clinical trials, for both stroke and heart disease, to begin within two to three years, possibly leading to a new way of reversing the damage from heart attacks by using a potent, spider-derived antidote.

"A NASA instrument on the International Space Station is uniquely positioned to provide firefighters with valuable intel regarding wildfire progression and hotspots over time. Data from the thermal maps produced by ECOSTRESS has helped frontline responders contain about 53% of the Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon, which two weeks ago was the largest wildfire burning in the U.S. ECOSTRESS — — is measuring surface temperature from the vantage point of space, with the ability to observe fires at a high spatial resolution (around 70 meters), making it ideal for tracking fires. Researchers on the RADR-Fire team at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have been experimenting with ECOSTRESS data as part of a new tool now being implemented for first responders like the U.S. Forest Service. In one instance, ECOSTRESS was tracking the movement of the Bootleg Fire and identifying its proximity to critical infrastructure. Areas in red represent the hottest pixels ECOSTRESS can detect. The extreme heat in the red areas indicate the fire front, or where resources are most needed. The capabilities of ECOSTRESS are unique. Most satellites don’t have high-enough resolution to track the fine line of the fire front, but when they do achieve higher resolution than ECOSTRESS, they require 5–16 days to return to the same area again, while the space station crosses overhead twice in one day. : ECOSTRESS also captured data over Northern California’s Dixie Fire, which had doubled in size to more than 220,000 acres in a few days. : More than 7,000 personnel at the end of July were involved in the wildfire response to the two fires. Although they have a variety of tools at their disposal, the use of spaceborne high-resolution data like that provided by ECOSTRESS serves as a good example of the versatility and real-world impact satellite data can provide.

"The folds and ripples at the front of a moth’s forewings are a sophisticated defense system against the echolocation of hunting bats in the darkness, a new study reveals. Moths have developed several forms of sonic decoys to throw hunting bats off their scent, but a thorough examination done at the University of Bristol has shown the decoys developed on the forewing tips have a unique success rate. Bats create ultrasonic clicks with their mouth that bounce off of objects in the dark and return to be picked up by their hyperdeveloped auditory organs, giving them a picture of the world around them. Luna moths have been known to develop long gown-like hindwings with screwed-up tips. It’s been shown that these hindwings are very strong reflectors of sound, such that it’s actually more likely a bat would end up attacking the decoy rather than the vulnerable body of the moth. Some large silkmoths though, like the Atlas moth or the ailanthus silkmoth have rippled and folded tips on their forewings, which have been revealed as the superior method of defense. “We noticed that on many of the larger silkmoths, the forewing tips are actually folded and rippled, in a way not to dissimilar to the hindwing decoys we looked at earlier,” , a bioacoustics researcher at School for Biological Sciences, Bristol U. He and his colleague Marc Holdereid bombarded the wings of an Atlas moth with different frequencies of ultrasonic sound from over 10,000 directions to test how well they might reflect the clicks from a hungry bat. The results, published in , were that forewing folds and ripples bounced off incoming sound, releasing it back into the environment in 180 degrees around the wing. This made them more reflective of sound, and therefore a better sonic defense, even than the hindwing decoys used by the Luna moths. The folds reflected the sound by sending it into a series of ninety-degree angles within the fold, which the ripples acted as hemispheric reflectors of sound like a bowl or an amphitheater. Another benefit of the decoys being in the forewings is that they are rigid in structure, and so any bat attacks would likely knock a moth off its flight path, rather than damage the wing. : Another fascinating detail of this fascinating evolutionary defense system is that it may have evolved independently more than four times across the entire genus, and 36 of the 72 species Neil and Holdereid examined had either folded or rippled forewings, yet never together with a wing decoy. Perhaps because two decoys, being present at each end of the moth, might clue the bat into the fact that something of interest might be in the middle. It’s a perfect example of nature’s ability to pair graceful form with life-saving function.

"This is the heartwarming moment villagers showed great teamwork to retrieve a crashed pickup truck from a steep hill. The vehicle was traveling along the slope when the driver lost control and skidded off the dirt road in Chiang Mai province in northern Thailand. More than fifty locals volunteered to pull the old vehicle that rolled over the hills and was stuck on the edge of a cabbage field terrace. They helped the driver out of the truck before trying thick ropes around the truck to pull it. After almost an hour, the vehicle was successfully towed back to the road. Resident Malinee Laowang, a niece of the driver, said: “I saw the pickup truck toppled down the hill and flipped multiple times.” “I remember running towards the car and smashing the windows open with a rock to let my relative out. More villagers came to help us even without asking.” Malinee’s uncle narrowly survived the crash and only suffered minor cuts and bruises and the car was dragged back to the driver’s home.

"The story of the Southwest suffering under the second-driest period in 1,200 years is being turned into another one, of cooperation and dedication to preserving as much water as possible. Lake Mead, the site of the Hoover Dam, and the chief water resource of a sprawling series of desert communities and metropolises, is falling. But revealed in its falling to the lowest levels ever recorded is not only the “bathtub ring” of calcium buildups seen here, but decades of cooperative drought contingency planning and water conservation infrastructure implemented not only through the seven states that rely on the Colorado River Basin and Lake Mead, but Mexico too. It was in 2007 that the seven states of California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming, as well as many tribes, and Mexico all agreed on a framework for use of the mighty Colorado River and Lake Mead, but in the face of the current 22-year drought, which led the federal government last Monday to declare the first ever shortage of water from Lake Mead, something more had to be done. After years of tough negotiations, each state agreed to share the burden of future potential water shortages, pursuant to the 2019 Drought Contingency Plan. As Lake Mead is expected to drop below a depth of 1,075 feet next year, the first round of water cuts will come into effect in the states of Nevada and Arizona, and for Mexico. At 1,045 feet, it would be California’s turn to take a cut. “We haven’t had litigation. If you look at any other river basin, they have litigation going like crazy,” Patricia Aaron, spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, told the Christian Science Monitor. “Everybody is in this together. It gives me a lot of hope and a lot of confidence. There are a lot of dedicated, smart people working on this problem.” Mexico for their part led the way in a bilateral contingency plan in 2017. Under current agreements Mexico of the total volume of the Colorado River ever year. “We knew it was the correct thing to do,” also heard from Roberto Salmon, former- Mexican commissioner of the International Boundary and Water Commission. “We are all trying to save the [Colorado River] basin. The livelihood of millions of people depends on it, including Mexico.” Several states have already invested millions into ensuring that when a water shortage in the Colorado or Lake Mead did arrive, they wouldn’t be caught out. In Nevada for example, Las Vegas a seven-billion gallon reduction in water use from Lake Mead as having “little impact.” This is a result of sophisticated water recycling that sends spent water back to Lake Mead, as well as the use of ornamental desert foliage for public parks and real estate. In California, which draws about three times as much water as Mexico, water authorities built up reserves during the wet years of 2017 and 2019, while implementing additional storm drain and wastewater recovery methods to boost supply. The 19 million people living in Southern California now use 40% less water than they did in 1990, CSM reports. Arizona has also “banked” water in Lake Mead, pre-delivering a 50% store of its yearly share through savings accumulated over a decade of diversifying its supply, for example by drawing on the Salt and Verde Rivers. Phoenix, which has exploded in size over the past two decades, has also reduced its water consumption by 30%. South of the border, Mexico’s agreement to be first on the chopping block for cuts from Lake Mead was penned alongside promises from California, Nevada, and Arizona to invest $31.5 million in conservation and infrastructure projects in the Mexicali Valley which will save 200,000 acre feet of water per year. This U.S. citizen is accustomed to feeling there was no plan in the aftermath of natural disasters or dangerous natural phenomena, but in the deserts of the Southwest that is certainly not the case, and the inter-cooperation between state, tribe, city, and nation is something to behold.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/lake-mead-water-shortages-declared-but-the-states-are-prepared/
"Sound is what sets off the best memories—ahead of sight and even smell, according to a new poll. Birds singing and waves crashing on the shore were among the top sounds most likely to trigger people’s fond memories. A study of 2,000 adults, aged 50 and over, found four in 10 people experience sounds that prompt nostalgic thoughts a couple of times a week. For some, rain on the windows, sheep bleating, and a train going down the tracks are enough to make them smile. Other respondents said these sounds transport them to another place in another time, including trees blowing in the wind, a crackling fireplace, and church bells. Gordon Harrison, chief audiologist at , which commissioned the survey, said, “Sound impacts most aspects of our lives, so it is no surprise that certain sounds trigger happy youthful memories.” This is particularly true when it comes to sounds of the outdoors. These trigger memories of good times for 67 percent of adults. No wonder 78 percent of those polled said they tend to spend lots of time outside. And of the 94 percent who have access to their own outdoor space, they’ll spend an average of five hours in it every week – with 72 percent referring to it as their ‘happy place’. The kettle whistling, the radio playing, and cats purring also featured in the top 40 positively-triggering sounds, according to the over 50s. More than three quarters said that as they grow older, they treasure their happy memories more. : However, more than half of respondents admitted their hearing has deteriorated with age, yet only 26 percent have had it checked by an audiologist. A full 90% confessed they took their hearing for granted in their younger years, according to the survey, carried out through OnePoll. And 45% worry about their hearing getting worse, especially when being questioned about losing the ability to have some of these pleasurable memories triggered by the sounds around them. 1.

"A kid moved away from his friends and the familiarity of New Jersey to California, then immediately grabbed a local problem by the scruff of the neck with a brilliant invention. Along with potentially winning himself a career in advertisement television with an excellent reveal video and excitable timbre, an 11th grade San Francisco student has invented a fire-activated extinguisher to protect the property of those he loves now that he lives in a state that has a wildfire “season.” A single device is capable of protecting fire-risk areas in one’s house, while multiple can form a defensive perimeter around one’s entire property against low to moderate intensity fires. “Over the past three years, there have been almost 7,500,000 acres of wildfire in California alone, destroying nearly 50,000 structures,” describes Arul Mathur, inventor of the Fire-Activated-Canister-Extinguisher, or F.A.C.E. When a sensor on the device heats up to a certain temperature, a glycerin element bursts within, releasing an eco-friendly fire-retardant spray with the aid of a sprinkler. The retardant can be re-filled quite easily, and the only other human-controlled aspect is the initial introduction of air-pressure into the canister which can be done manually through a valve at the top. Mathur planned to introduce the device via , which saw his goal of $10,000 reached in less than a day, and came with an offer of $99 for F.A.C.E, that will now go up on retail for $120 when production begins. The only existing market alternative for F.A.C.E is a manual extinguisher, or an automatic sprinkler system, which unless it can be installed during construction of the house, will normally cost between $1 to $3 dollars per square foot, amounting to many thousands for a family home. Mathur wrote in his Kickstarter that every penny of profit will go to providing F.A.C.E. donations to fire risk areas. Indeed 5-6 feet of spray isn’t enough to stop large fires, but if enough are placed in strategic areas, neighborhoods or rural communities can work together to prevent brush fires from becoming wildfires, or living room fires from becoming house fires. At the very least it could help delay a fire until firefighters arrive with more powerful equipment.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/11th-grader-invents-automatic-fire-extinguisher-to-protect-homes-and-property/
"Our partner Rob Brezsny provides his weekly wisdom to enlighten our thinking and motivate our mood. Rob’s , is a syndicated weekly column appearing in over a hundred publications. He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): The next two months will be a propitious time for you and your intimate allies to grow closer by harnessing the power of your imaginations. I urge you to be inventive in dreaming up ways to educate and entertain each other. Seek frisky adventures together that will delight you. Here’s a poem by that I hope will stimulate you: “We are two flames in a midnight forest. We are two meteors that fly at night, a two-pointed arrow of one fate. We are two steeds whose bridle is held by one hand. We are two eyes of a single gaze, two quivering wings of one dream, two-voiced lips of single mysteries. We are two arms of a single cross.” VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Virgo spiritual author urges us not to take anything personally. He says that if someone treats us disrespectfully, it’s almost certainly because they are suffering from psychological wounds that make them act in vulgar, insensitive ways. Their attacks have little to do with what’s true about us. I agree with him, and will add this important caveat. Even if you refrain from taking such abuses personally, it doesn’t mean you should tolerate them. It doesn’t mean you should keep that person in your life or allow them to bully you in the future. I suspect these are important themes for you to contemplate right now. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): “People who feel deeply, live deeply, and love deeply are destined to suffer deeply,” writes poet Juansen Dizon. To that romanticized, juvenile nonsense, I say: NO! WRONG! People who feel and live and love deeply are more emotionally intelligent than folks who live on the surface—and are therefore less fragile. The deep ones are likely to be psychologically adept; they have skills at liberating themselves from the smothering crush of their problems. The deep ones also have access to rich spiritual resources that ensure their suffering is a source of transformative teaching—and rarely a cause of defeat. Have you guessed that I’m describing you as you will be in the coming weeks? SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Professor of psychology Ethan Kross tells us there can be healthy, creative forms of envy. “Just as hunger tells us we need to eat,” he writes, “the feeling of envy could show us what is missing from our lives that really matters to us.” The trick is to not interpret envy as a negative emotion, but to see it as useful information that shows us what we want. In my astrological opinion, that’s a valuable practice for you to deploy in the coming days. So pay close attention to the twinges of envy that pop into your awareness. Harness that volatile stuff to motivate yourself as you make plans to get the very experience or reward you envy. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Poet Walt Whitman bragged that he was “large.” He said, “I contain multitudes.” One critic compared him to “a whole continent with its waters, with its trees, with its animals.” Responding to Whitman, Sagittarian poet uttered an equally grandiose boast. “I too am a continent,” she wrote. “I contain mountains never-reached, scrubland unpenetrated, pond bay, river-delta, salt-licking coast-tongue.” That’s how I’m imagining you these days, dear Sagittarius: as unexplored territory: as frontier land teeming with undiscovered mysteries. I love how expansive you are as you open your mind and heart to new self-definitions. I love how you’re willing to risk being unknowable for a while as you wander out in the direction of the future. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Poet Ezra Pound wrote a letter to novelist James Joyce that included the following passage: “You are f**king with my head, and so far I’ve been enjoying it. Where is the crime?” I bring this up, Capricorn, because I believe the coming weeks will be prime time for you to engage with interesting souls who mess with your head in enjoyable ways. You need a friendly jolt or two: a series of galvanizing prods; dialogs that catalyze you to try new ways of thinking and seeing; lively exchanges that inspire you to experiment. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Blogger Mandukhai Munkhbaatar offers advice on the arts of intimate communion. “Do not fall in love only with a body or with a face,” she tells us. “Do not fall in love with the idea of being in love.” She also wants you to know that it’s best for your long-term health and happiness if you don’t seek cozy involvement with a person who is afraid of your madness, or with someone who, after you fight, disappears and refuses to talk. I approve of all these suggestions. Any others you would add? It’s a favorable phase to get clearer about the qualities of people you want and don’t want as your allies. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): I gave my readers homework, asking them to answer the question, “What is your favorite rule to break?” In response, Laura Grolla sent these thoughts: “My favorite rule to break is an unwritten one: that we must all stress and strive for excellence. I have come up with a stress-busting mantra, ‘It is OK to be OK.’ In my OKness, I have discovered the subtle frontier of contentment, which is vast and largely unexplored. OKness allows me not to compete for attention, but rather to pay attention to others. I love OKness for the humor and deep, renewing sleep it has generated. Best of all, OKness allows me to be happily aging rather than anxiously hot.” I bring this to your attention, Pisces, because I think the coming weeks will be a favorable time for you to investigate and embody the relaxing mysteries of OKness. ARIES (March 21-April 19): Filmmaker Federico Fellini had an unexpected definition of happiness. He said it was “being able to speak the truth without hurting anyone.” I suspect you will have abundant access to that kind of happiness in the coming weeks, Aries. I’ll go even further: You will have extra power to speak the truth in ways that heal and uplift people. My advice to you, therefore, is to celebrate and indulge your ability. Be bold in expressing the fullness of what’s interesting to you. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): “Look for a long time at what pleases you, and longer still at what pains you,” wrote the novelist Colette. What?! Was she making a perverse joke? That’s wicked advice, and I hope you adopt it only on rare occasions. In fact, the exact opposite is the healthy way to live—especially for you in the coming weeks. Look at what pains you, yes. Don’t lose sight of what your problems and wounds are. But please, for the sake of your dreams, for the benefit of your spiritual and psychological health, look longer at what pleases you, energizes you, and inspires you. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): If you deepen your affection for butterflies and hummingbirds, I will love it. If you decide you want the dragonfly or bumblebee or lark to be , I will approve. You almost always benefit from cultivating relationships with swift, nimble, and lively influences—and that’s especially true these days. So give yourself full permission to experiment with the superpower of playful curiosity. You’re most likely to thrive when you’re zipping around in quest of zesty ripples and sprightly rhythms. CANCER (June 21-July 22): Life is showing you truths about what you are not, what you don’t need, and what you shouldn’t strive for. That’s auspicious, although it may initially feel unsettling. I urge you to welcome these revelations with gratitude. They will help you tune in to the nuances of what it means to be radically authentic. They will boost your confidence in the rightness of the path you’ve chosen for yourself. I’m hoping they may even show you which of your fears are irrelevant. Be hungry for these extraordinary teachings.

"It’s pretty easy to make clothing designed to keep you warm, either with natural inspirations or synthetic designs, but making something designed to keep you cool is much harder. While objects like cars and buildings can be coated in ultra-white paint or mirrors that reflect the sun’s rays, a pair of Chinese scientists have figured out how to make a normal t-shirt keep your skin temperature 5°C cooler. The scientists say it can be mass produced at only a fractional increase in cost, promising a generation of outdoor workers or beachgoers a way to ease the effects of unmitigated climate change. Within the rays of the sun, near-infrared electromagnetic radiation (NIR) is one component that heats up whatever the sun sets its gaze on. They also cool when they are emitted, but if water vapor is in the air, the NIR are absorbed within and keep the surrounding air temperature hot. Human skin naturally emits a different electromagnetic radiation, called mid-infrared, which instead of being trapped in water particles, goes directly out of our atmosphere. Ma Yaoguang of Zhejiang University and Tao Guangming of Huazhong University of Science and Technology that contains particles of titanium dioxide to reflect the NIR, and that also contains polylactic acid which absorbs body heat and ejects it through the shirt as MIR to cool the wearer. When a trialist donned a vest, half of which was white cotton and the other half the cooling fabric, thermal imaging showed the part of his body underneath the artificial fabric remained 5°C (9°F) cooler after he sat in a lawn chair under the sun for an hour. There’s some doubt, of whether the motion of fabric will diminish the effect, as MIR-emitting material of any kind has only ever been tested when it remains flat and motionless towards the sun. A billowing t-shirt curved to the shoulders and arms of a human being may result in different outcomes over a vertical midday sun. But the scientists also noted that material and production costs are only about a tenth higher than cotton, so anything that gets us closer to protective clothing for hot periods is hopeful indeed.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/heat-reflecting-t-shirt-could-keep-the-world-cool-under-global-warming/
"Proteins constitute an essential dietary component that help in the growth and repair of the body. Composed of long chains of amino acids, they promote the growth of skeletal muscles—which is the group of muscles that help us move. Humans have been aware of the benefits of proteins for a long time. However, recent studies have shown that having the right amount of protein at the right time of the day is essential for proper growth. This is called Chrononutrition—which looks at how you eat is as important as what and how you eat. The reason behind this is the body’s internal biological clock. Called the circadian rhythm, this rhythm is followed by all cells and controls life functions like metabolism and growth. Interestingly, protein digestion and absorption have been found to fluctuate across day and night according to this clock. Moreover, earlier studies have reported that intake of protein at breakfast and lunch promotes skeletal muscle growth in adults. However, details on the effect of the time of protein intake on muscle growth and function have remained elusive until now. Fortunately, researchers from Waseda University, led by Professor Shigenobu Shibata, recently endeavored to understand the effect of the distribution of protein intake through the day on muscles. They fed laboratory mice two meals per day containing either high (11.5% by proportion) or low (8.5% by proportion) protein concentrations. The researchers noted that protein intake at breakfast induced an increase in muscle growth, determined by assessing induced hypertrophy of the plantaris muscle in the leg, when compared with the effects of protein intake at dinner. Specifically, the ratio of muscle hypertrophy determined against the growth of the control muscle was 17% higher in mice fed 8.5% protein at breakfast, than that in mice fed 11.5% protein at dinner, despite the former group consuming a low proportion of protein overall. They also found that early-in-the-day intake of a type of protein called the BCCA—short for branched-chain amino acids—increased the size of skeletal muscles specifically. They repeated diet distribution experiments on these mice but did not observe similar muscle change, which confirmed the involvement of the circadian rhythm in muscle growth in the context of protein intake. Excited about the findings of their study, published in a , Professor Shibata emphasizes, “Protein-rich diet at an early phase of the daily active period, that is at breakfast, is important to maintain skeletal muscle health and enhance muscle volume and grip strength.” To check if their findings were applicable to humans, the team recruited women in their study and tested if their muscle function, determined by measuring skeletal muscle index (SMI) and grip strength, varied with the timing of the protein-rich diet consumed. Sixty women aged 65 years and above who took protein at breakfast rather than at dinner showed better muscle functions, suggesting the possibility of the findings to be true across species. Additionally, the researchers also found a strong association between SMI and the proportion of protein intake at breakfast relative to total protein intake through the day. Professor Shibata is hopeful that the findings of their study will lead to a widespread modification in the current diet regime of most people across the Western and Asian countries, who traditionally consume low amounts of protein at breakfast. He therefore stresses, “For humans, in general, the protein intake at breakfast averages about 15 grams, which is less than what we consume at dinner, which is roughly 28 grams. “Our findings strongly support changing this norm and consuming more protein at breakfast or morning snacking time.” Relatively protein-rich foods that won’t feel too off-putting in the early hours include eggs, tofu, hempseed, oatmeal, chia, and nut butters. It seems, a simple change in our dietary regime can be our key to ensuring healthy muscles.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/waseda-university-research-protein-at-breakfast-muscles/
"When an animal faces the loss of mobility—especially when there’s an amputation involved—the impact can be devastating. Until not all that long ago, chances for a normal life were slim. If only someone could come up with a solution, imagine the difference it could make to countless lives? Well, someone has. Derrick Campana, star of BYUtv’s , a pioneer in the field of prosthetics and orthotics for animals, is kind of like what you’d get if you crossed Dr. Dolittle with the Six Million Dollar Man. Since 2005, Campana’s “pet fitters” have been building custom-made mobility devices for animals of all sizes and descriptions from cats and dogs, to eagles, tortoises, cows, foxes, camels, goats—and even a six-ton African elephant. In Wizard of Paws, with his wing-dog, Henry riding shotgun, Campana travels the U.S. creating custom-designed devices to help pets with a variety of mobility issues. “It’s about making families whole again,” Campana told . “I get to build these prosthetics at their houses. I get to experience the joy on the animals’ faces and [those] families’ faces as they walk again.” At his home base in Sterling, Virginia, Campana spends much of his time doing fittings and casting molds in order to create the forms he painstakingly hand-sculpts; finishing the devices with vacuum-formed plastic and a variety of other materials. Animal Ortho Care also currently ships casting kits all over the world. Compana hopes to broaden his outreach with advances in cost-effective 3-D printing technology—and since every animal that comes to him presents its own unique puzzle, expanding horizons and searching for new solutions is what Campana is all about. “It’s always interesting, never boring and I’m constantly learning,” he told . “Being able to combine [my] passion for building with helping animals is just an awesome thing. I’ve created my own industry here, so it’s kinda living the dream.” One of the most important parts of Campana’s mission is educating both pet owners and veterinarians about new and emerging options for care. He admits when he first started out, he got push-back from veterinary doctors trained in more traditional methods who didn’t fully grasp the potential benefits of orthotics and prosthetics for animal applications. However, since then, he’s been steadily been striving to show how such devices can actually offer better outcomes—including less post-surgical downtime, and in some cases, eliminating the need for surgery altogether. These days, the feedback he’s getting is pretty much resoundingly positive. For Campana, it’s easy to be a cheerleader when you truly love what you’re doing. “Seeing dogs wag their tails; their eyes kind of sparkle again, that moment when they haven’t walked in the last couple of years or maybe they’ve never walked before in their lives… You see them just run and get up and those are the moments that I kind of live for, and that’s why I do what I do,” he told . “I never thought in my wildest dreams I’d be helping animals all over the world or even helping animals in general. It’s not something you think of as a child because it never existed but if you have that idea, go for it. And if you’re passionate about it, go as hard as you can for as long as you can and you can make a huge difference in your life and in the life of so many [others].” ( the video for this story below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/prosthetics-any-animal-derrick-campana/
"Maybe nobody else understands, maybe they call you “crazy,” maybe they hold onto many of the old superstitions that still persist about the animal, but when you look into the eyes of your cat, you understand; you understand completely. Treasured once for their ability to catch vermin, and now as (sometimes) faithful companions, cats are an inseparable and beloved part of not only our lives, but our species, and a new Netflix mini-documentary series called aims to equally educate and entertain, and give credit for man’s other best friend. “Cat People explores our fascinating relationship with cats through the lens of some the most remarkable, and surprising “cat people” in the world, defying the negative stereotypes of what it means to be a cat person while revealing the fundamental truths of what it means to have deep bonds with these fiercely independent, mysterious creatures,” wrote Netflix in a . Featured in are some fantastic felines, including Maverick the surfing cat, and DJ Ravioli—a cat who plays music for TikTok rapper Moshow. “This goes beyond my music,” said the rapper during an interview on . “It’s so much bigger than me, my message is to save as many cats as possible, to make cats look cool and to break that stereotype of black cats being bad luck due to how they’re shown in certain lights.” “My thing is to break that stereotype. Cat ladies aren’t crazy, you’re all beautiful…” God only knows how much data has been used creating, uploading, and sharing cat videos on the internet, but the documentary doesn’t only focus on the charming and delightful side of felines. While trying to dispel the myth of the “crazy” part of a “cat lady,” it also explores the human component of the relationship, including the darker paths to reveal stories of generosity and kindness towards cats in need—particularly in one episode on the Greek island of Syros. Other episodes seek to break stereotypes about cats being unruly and independent. Acro-Cats founder Samantha features as a professional cat trainer and mom to some seriously talented felines. Surfing through the hashtags on Twitter, the general consensus towards the six, 30-minute episodes is something like: “You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll want to adopt every cat in your neighborhood.” For cat people, that sort of reaction is no surprise—for as the first paragraph above details, we’ve known all along.

"In the bitcoin community, there’s a phrase that someone has “diamond hands,” which means they will never drag the price down through selling. Well that’s nothing compared to the hands of one Australian veterinarian who performed surgery on a tree frog the size of a fingertip. Brought in by accident on some of the eucalyptus meant to feed the koalas at the RSPCA facility in Wacol, Brisbane, the tiny green tree frog wasn’t doing so well when wild animal vet Meaghan Barrow got a hold of him. “[A colleague] brought him into the clinic to me and she was really worried, she said ‘he seems to have a lump on the side of his body,'” she told “I had a close look and he actually had a little hole, it was only a couple of millimeters but on a tiny frog that’s only two centimeters long, that’s quite a big hole inside of his chest.” Some of the frog’s internal organs were poking out of the hole, and so the treatment plan was pretty straightforward—the frog needed a stitching up. And so administering anesthesia diluted to one one-thousandth of a dose to compensate for his tiny size, Barrow set to work. That wasn’t the end of the compensation, as all the surgical tools—the needle and the suture material, had to be miniscule. Furthermore, the normal application of pressure Barrow might apply when giving stitches to larger animals couldn’t work with the frog given how thin amphibian skin is. Amphibians like frogs sometimes draw oxygen through their skin, and so it’s very delicate. Steadying her diamond hands, Barrow successfully applied a single dissolvable suture and declared the operation a success. Indeed the frog was happily hopping around again the very next day, and even had his bright green color back, though that may have been a result of the painkillers, diluted again to one one-thousandth. “You learn to treat so many different animals that you have to be adaptable and try the skills that you’d apply to a dog or a cat, to any species,” Barrow commented, noting that she had done surgery on tiny frogs before, and that she was happy to help the little guy.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/vet-in-australia-performs-surgery-stitching-on-a-tiny-tree-frog/
"One of Britain’s rarest and largest butterflies will remind readers of that time a few years ago when the internet got all in a flutter over whether ‘The Dress’ was black and blue or white and gold. After decades of decline, the Purple Emperor is making something of a comeback in England’s woodlands. Despite its magnificent appearance, the species, affectionately dubbed His Imperial Majesty, is attracted to smelly cheese, human sweat, fish paste, and even dog and fox poo. But it is the strange colors of the wings of the male—which can appear blue to some people but brown to others—which is most amazing. Wildlife photographer Andrew Fusek Peters has been busy snapping the same butterfly from different angles. Andrew, who photographed the butterfly in Oversley Woods in Warwickshire, said: “They are ultra-rare, you do see photographs of them but like all British butterflies their numbers have declined catastrophically. “Conservation means their numbers are on the rise but they are still one of the rarest British butterflies. “They have this unbelievable quality where if you look at them from behind they are a brown butterfly and when you go round to the front of the wing it looks purple or blue. “This is the effect of the light on the thousands of scales that make up their wings. “The scales refract the light in different ways which is why you see the different colors. “It was amazing to think I was looking at the same butterfly when it looked completely different from either side, it is really, really extraordinary. “It was really special to be able to get so close—it was so relaxed. I had the lens four foot above the butterfly as it lay on the ground. “I had never seen one before in the four years I’ve been photographing butterflies,” he said. We’re grateful Peters finally got the chance to do so—thanks to local conservation efforts bringing Purple Emperor numbers back to healthier levels.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/one-of-britains-rarest-butterflies-what-color-blue-brown-purple-emperor/
"Setting goals and achieving them is the path that’s transformed one Olympic contender from a 17-year-old with a gig under the “golden arches” to a world-class athlete taking her shot at bringing home a gold medal at the Tokyo games. Quanesha Burks was raised by her grandparents. As a teen, she worked long hours at McDonald’s, earning what she could to help support her family. Even so, she says she happily went to work each day because she saw her labors as an investment in a bigger game plan that included attending college. From early on, Burks excelled at sports. In high school, she realized her athletic prowess might be the ticket to a college scholarship. Initially, her choice of sport was a toss-up between basketball and track, but once she’d taken third at the 2012 USATF National Junior Olympics, her course was set. After researching the requirements for a full ride, Burks set her goals down on paper and stuck to them. By the time she graduated from Hartselle High School, she’d earned 11 state track titles and a scholarship to the University of Alabama. With an impressive NCAA indoor long jump title in 2015 followed by an outdoor win in 2016, Burks racked up All-America Honors, but even with her many achievements, her road to the Olympics has had its own share of hurdles. In 2018, Burks finished a disappointing fourth at the World Athletics Indoor Championships. The following year, her beloved grandfather passed away one week prior to the U.S. Outdoor Track and Field Championships. Understandably, her performance suffered. By the time 2020 rolled around, Burks was back in a winning groove. Then the COVID-19 pandemic shut down most sporting events, leaving her and other hopeful athletes in limbo. She continued to train until a bone injury sidelined her for nearly three months. “It felt like all the odds were against me,” Burks told . “At one point, my coach told me, ‘I don’t know if you’re going to physically be able to go to the trials.’ The doctors didn’t know if I would be back in time… I was facing so much, but I kept going back to when I worked at McDonald’s. I had my goals set and I knew I could do it.” Although forced to refrain from her usual rigorous activities, Burks remained determined to achieve her Olympic dreams. To keep her spirits up, she recorded a series of positive affirmations and posted them to her . During the trials for the Tokyo Olympics, her tenacity paid off. At age 25, with a long-jump personal best of 6.96 meters, Burks took an overall third, securing her spot on the Team USA roster. “It’s a blessing to be like one from my hometown in a small community, really just representing myself, but Hartselle, the University of Alabama and the state of Alabama,” Burks told . “Knowing that I’m representing us in Tokyo is just a blessing, it’s an honor and I’m so proud of the other Olympians.” While Quanesha Burks is well aware she might not be a high-profile as some of her teammates, she reasons it’s because she’s taken a different path to get where she is—and that’s fine with her. “I didn’t have everything laid out for me. I didn’t have all the eyes on me. I feel like still to this day I get overlooked. That’s okay,” she told Sports Illustrated. “I just know it all starts with your confidence within. Everything I’ve become is because of my mindset and my determination… It’s been a journey and it all started with a little girl working at McDonald’s and here I am.” Although scoring the cover of a Wheaties box would be nice, even if she doesn’t medal at Tokyo, Burks hopes it’s her legacy of hard work and determination that will ultimately serve as an inspiration for other up-and-coming Olympians working a day job until they can live the dream.

"Three unsuspecting women. One cheating boyfriend. And the epic road trip of a lifetime. Can this plucky trio of former flames bond over the man who ‘done ’em wrong’ to find love, laughter, adventure, and friendships that will last a lifetime? Cue the uplifting soundtrack because this sounds like a Hollywood movie, right? But this tale of three women who went from hoodwinked GFs to unlikely BFFs is true. Abi Roberts, Bekah King, and Morgan Tabor were all dating someone they thought was a great guy—only it turned out their Prince Charming happened to be dating all three of them at the same time. Around last Christmas, some too-friendly texts and flirtatious photos led Tabor to believe something strange might be going on. As it turned out, her less-than stalwart lover’s social media accounts confirmed her worst suspicions. The 21-year-old in Boise, Idaho, reached out to one of the girls via Instagram to share the bad news that their “exclusive” boyfriend was less than exclusive. They began to bond as the shared their mutual feelings of shock and dismay. But that relationship was just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Tabor’s further sleuthing revealed that in addition to the other Idaho woman she’d already contacted, “the boyfriend who shall remain nameless” had also been simultaneously dating an art student from Salt Lake City. “We were having a great time, and then around December, I got a text from two girls,” Roberts told . “One of them… basically said, ‘Hey, are you dating this person?’ And I said yes. And they’re like, ‘Well, we’re both dating him, too.’ So that was a huge shocker.” In a moment straight out of the movies, the guy was busted when he showed up on Tabor’s doorstep, a courtly bouquet of flowers in hand, during a revelatory FaceTime chat between Tabor and Roberts. While he tried to talk his way around his dodgy dating agenda, the girls weren’t buying the sorry line of defense he was trying to sell. Following a hunch there might be more members in their strange and growing sisterhood, Tabor and Roberts followed the evidence, eventually tracking down and telling the truth to another half-dozen women he was also seeing. After a brief confab, the three women summarily dumped him, but rather than become bitter over the experience, they eventually decided to meet up. “We did a lot of trauma processing and memory sharing, and it was obvious that we were all really cool, fun people who had a lot in common,” Roberts told the . “Right away, we became good friends.” During their initial get-together, the three compared relationship stories about their departed beau. They also learned they had a lot in common as he was attracted to women with similar interests—and he’d told all of them about his romantic dream of traveling the country in an old VW bus. While they laughed over his predictability they had a lightbulb moment. Why not take that dream and turn it into a reality? With the help of friends and family, they obtained an old school bus and parked it in Boise, where they up-fitted it into a modern-day tiny house on wheels straight out of the pages of a glossy magazine. This summer, they hit the road. The trio’s travel itinerary includes Washington State; Yellowstone, Glacier, and Grand Teton National Parks, and a drive south along the West Coast. The women all take turns at the wheel, and to finance the journey they worked remotely several hours per week. To say the trip has been transformational is an understatement. None of the three women could have foreseen how sweet the eventual outcome of their journey would be. Rather than getting mad, and getting even, they’ve chosen instead to take ‘the high road’. “At face value, a lot of people think we’re just doing this [to spite our ex], but no,” Roberts told . “This is very authentically us following our dreams and taking opportunities.” “We all feel really blessed that we found each other,” Roberts told Washington Post. “We’re friends for life.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/morgan-tabor-bam-bus-cheating-boyfriend-road-trip/
"Like many wild herbs, the number of uses for rosemary are nearly endless. A nutritional supplement, an herb, a cleaning agent, a pest repellent, and even in part of burial traditions, the spikey Mediterranean aromatic has been in use for at least 7,000 years. For some, rosemary is a weed accessible in four or five different places within a 100 yard radius of the house. For others, it’s an aromatic that one must pay two to three dollars for at the grocery store. Rosemary can be picked at anytime in the plant’s life, and pruning it actually increases its growth rate and vitality. However you acquire your rosemary, you’ll be growing it on your windowsill by the end of this article, as the number of uses it has can eliminate a lot of different things from your shopping lists. Adding rosemary to a bit of olive oil in an airtight glass container helps preserve the scent and flavor of the herb for later use. Another way to make a tasty infusion with rosemary is by adding sprigs of rosemary, oregano, and marjoram into white vinegar to create Rosemary is for adding an even more herbaceous flavor to already-herbaceous gin. Simply put some rosemary (and maybe a bit of lemon) into an airtight jar with a bit of gin (or whichever booze you prefer) and let it sit for a week. Rosemary can be used to re-create boring butter to make an extra-special spread for toast or bread. Simply make the butter soft, add some herbs like rosemary, and reshape into a log or brick before cooling again. goes into more detail and includes things like garlic and chartreuse. A lot of deodorants have pretty wretched chemicals in them like parabens (an endocrine disrupter) and aluminum chlorohydrate (a carcinogen), which begs the question: why we don’t use what nature made pleasant smelling to combat our own B.O.? Rosemary essential oil can help in this sense—but this a lot of information about deodorant chemicals, and their scientifically discovered harms—as well as plenty of tips to stay smelling fresh and piney, including how to use rosemary as a natural deodorant. Herbs often have cosmetic and beautification properties, and rosemary is no exception. Along with unblocking follicles and clearing dandruff with its antimicrobial properties, rosemary essential oil can stimulate blood flow in the scalp, increasing the speed of hair growth. This using lavender, thyme, mint, nettle, and cedarwood together with rosemary. If you’re studying for an exam, rushing to meet a work deadline, moving house, or dealing with a tough project in the office, spending a few minutes inhaling deeply of rosemary oil, as “woo-woo” as that sounds, is scientifically proven to help. “Here we show for the first time that performance on cognitive tasks is significantly related to concentration of absorbed 1,8-cineole following exposure to rosemary aroma, with improved performance at higher concentrations,” testing this hypothesis. “Furthermore, these effects were found for speed and accuracy outcomes, indicating that the relationship is not describing a speed–accuracy trade off.” At this point, if you haven’t stolen some rosemary cuttings from your neighbor or run and bought a plant from the shop, the idea that rosemary oil might save you from a trip to the dentist’s office might that rosemary oil in regular toothpaste or four rosemary sprigs and four whole cloves mixed into 2 cups of boiling water to make a homemade mouthwash can really increase the protection against bacteria that cause gingivitis and bad breath. A simmer pot is a great way of getting that delicious pine-fresh scent of rosemary into your house. Fill a saucepan with water, bring to a boil and add your favorite herbs and spices. Reduce to a simmer, topping up the water whenever it runs too low. Cranberries, oranges, cinnamon, cardamom, and rosemary are all great choices to make the house smell great. Additionally, drops of rosemary oil and lavender onto your pillow at night will help keep sinuses clear and induce deeper, more restorative sleep. Adding 10 drops of essential rosemary oil per one cup of water to a spray bottle will help keep pests from entering your house. During insect-laden months, spray a little of this around the doors and windows of your home. Alternatively, keeping sprigs of dried rosemary in the backs of your cupboards is said to deter mice. The aforementioned antimicrobial properties of rosemary make the oil perfect for like eczema, cuts, mosquito bites, rashes, mild infections, or even acne. For congestion, boil water and transfer it to a heat-poof bowl. Heat plenty of rosemary in said bowl and, covering bowl and head with a towel to seal in the steam, breath deeply for some minutes until your sinuses are cleared. When enjoyed as a tea, rosemary is proven scientifically, and approved in Germany, to treat heartburn and indigestion, muscle pain, and even arthritis. Now that you know all the different things you can do with rosemary, it’s time to learn how to turn this common plant into the delivery mechanisms discussed above. There seems to be a severe disconnect in online guides between distilled essential oil from rosemary and rosemary-infused oil. Infused oil is quite easy, but many guides will say “how to make rosemary essential oil” when what they are actually showing you is how to make infused oil. Distilled oil not often found in a normal house, while infused oil requires a simple jar, saucepan, cheesecloth, oil, and rosemary. Step 1: Sterilize the jar and lid by boiling it in water and allowing it to dry thoroughly. If using fresh rosemary wash thoroughly and let dry completely. Step 2: Heat 2 cups of oil in a saucepan and cook around 1 cup of rosemary on low heat without letting the oil bubble around the rosemary leaves. Some guides say one hour, others say three. Step 3: Placing a cheese cloth over the jar, strain the oil/rosemary mixture in and refrigerate immediately. Use when completely cool. Olive oil bases made in this way have about a 2-3 week shelf life, but can become rancid, while others made with industrial seed, vegetable, or beauty-sector oils like jojoba or argan will last about 2 months. Used for several things, including to make rosemary oil, or to allegedly keep mice away, dried rosemary takes longer to create, but it’s not so much work. Take up to 8 sprigs of rosemary, preferably the straighter ones, and tie the bases together with twine or a rubber band. Make sure they are not covered in dew after you cut them. Hang them in a cool dry place for 2 weeks, such as inside a high-up cupboard. Tying a brown paper bag perforated with holes around the rosemary will stop the light bleaching the leaves or dust from settling on them. You could also use your oven at the lowest temp setting, cooking the sprigs well-spaced out for about 2-4 hours.

"While type-2 diabetes is largely preventable, type-1 diabetes is a disruptive autoimmune disorder that was thought incurable. ‘Once’ is the keyword here, as a new and uncontroversial form of stem cell treatment should be able to cure the disease once and for all. Relying on transforming a small piece of adult skin tissue into beta-cells in the pancreas— the ones which produce the insulin hormone illusive in diabetics—the treatment bypasses the genetic mutation that causes the immune system to attack these cells which creates the disease. Diabetes, especially type-1, severely limits quality of life, and if not carefully managed can result in serious complications like foot amputations and early mortality. Furthermore, it costs the U.S. medical care industry per patient per lifetime’s worth of treatment—an enormous burden that if lifted could save the entire sector hundreds of millions. Researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, an avant-garde force in all forms biology, have to produce beta-pancreas cells for this type-1 treatment—and now the only thing standing in the way of it becoming available in a hospital setting is safety trials in humans. “Stem cells are an extremely promising approach for developing many cell therapies, including better treatments for type-1 diabetes,” Salk professor Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, senior author of the corresponding paper, “This method for manufacturing large numbers of safe and functional beta cells is an important step forward.” The reason that stipulation is important is that while their paper gives 11 citations to the concept of using stem cell therapy to cure diabetes, going all the way back to 2007, there are challenges, as yet unsurmounted, with manufacturing beta-pancreas cells. Before stem cells were used, patients from donors with a totally functioning insulin system, but low donor rates made this treatment a slow burner, even though it was successful. Existing methods of stem cells only successfully convert around 10-40% of the human-pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into beta-pancreas cells. Additionally, beta-pancreas cells from PSCs tend to be heterogenous and contain unwanted cell types that can impede or disrupt the maturation and function of the desired beta-pancreas cells. for utilizing PSCs to create beta cells also sometimes results in dysfunction, or in some cases the formation of (sometimes enormous) teratomas, or cysts. “In order for beta cell-based treatments to eventually become a viable option for patients, it’s important to make these cells easier to manufacture,” co-first author Haisong Liu, a former member of Dr. Belmonte’s lab, told Salk. “We need to find a way to optimize the process.” And they did just that. Utilizing a 3-dimensional petri dish allowed the cells to interact and grow in an environment similar to how they would naturally, and within two weeks of being transplanted into diabetic mice, their blood sugars dropped to normal levels like those seen in non-diabetic mice. To test the safety and efficacy of the manufactured beta cells, the team transplanted them at different stages and observed the effects. At the highest stages of growth, the cells did not result in cyst formation even 20 weeks after implantation, and exhibited proper functionality and . The method of three-dimensional stem cell production will continue to be refined at Salk, with the only remaining hurdle human trials and FDA approval. At least one pharmaceutical company has this year on the trials to test a stem cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, so it seems the medical condition’s days are numbered.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/new-stem-cell-production-for-treatment-of-diabetes-brings-cure-closer/
"If you’ve been dreaming of that next vacation, you’ll be excited to know that thanks to Canada’s rising vaccination rates and declining COVID-19 cases, the government has given exact dates for when U.S. and international travelers will be able to freely cross the border. As a first step, on August 9 Canada plans to begin allowing entry to fully vaccinated American citizens and permanent residents who are currently living in the States. On September 7, the government intends to open Canada’s borders to any fully vaccinated travelers. According , fully vaccinated, eligible travelers will not have to quarantine upon arrival in Canada. “Canadians have worked hard and sacrificed for each other, and because of that work, we can take these next steps safely,” Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health, explained. From August 9, in addition to landing at Montréal-Trudeau International Airport, Toronto Pearson International Airport, Calgary International Airport, and Vancouver International Airport, international flights carrying passengers will be permitted to land at the following five additional Canadian airports: All travelers, regardless of vaccination status, will still require a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test result. However from August 9, Canada is adjusting its post-arrival testing strategy for fully vaccinated travellers. The government states that: “Using a new border testing surveillance program at airports and land border crossings, fully vaccinated travellers will not need a post-arrival test unless they have been randomly selected to complete a Day 1 COVID-19 molecular test. There are no changes to the mandatory testing requirements for unvaccinated travellers.” This strategy allows the Government of Canada to continue monitoring variants of concern in Canada and vaccine effectiveness. Using these layers of protection, the Government of Canada can monitor the COVID-19 situation in Canada, respond quickly to threats, and guide decisions on restricting international travel. Finally, with the advent of increased vaccination rates in Canada, declining COVID-19 cases and reduced pressure on health care capacity, the three-night government authorized hotel stay requirement will be eliminated for all travellers arriving by air as of August 9. Fully vaccinated travellers who meet the requirements will be exempt from quarantine; however, all travellers must still provide a quarantine plan and be prepared to quarantine, in case it is determined at the border that they do not meet the necessary requirements. “We have been fully engaged with our American counterparts given the deep economic and family ties between our two countries,” Bill Blair, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said. This “announcement is another big step in our approach to easing border measures.” Sounds like it’s time to start planning your next vacation.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/canada-is-opening-its-borders-to-fully-vaccinated-americans-in-early-august/
"Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s are diseases of the brain in which gradual degeneration of neurons leads to loss of speech, memory, and thinking. Existing remedies are aimed only at suppressing symptoms, but cannot stop the process of neurodegeneration itself. Now Russian scientists have synthesized chemical compounds that can stop the degeneration of neurons in Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other severe brain pathologies. New molecules of pyrrolyl- and indolylazine classes activate intracellular mechanisms to combat one of the main causes of “aged” brain diseases—an excess of so-called amyloid structures that accumulate in the human brain with age. Experts from various institutes including Ural Federal University took part in the study, published in the . “Our compounds activate the synthesis of specific heat shock proteins and cause their accumulation in the cell,” said research co-author, professor of the Department of Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry at UrFU Irina Utepova. “Proteins of this type make it possible to protect neuronal tissue from an excess of toxic amyloids and to protect cells from various types of stress, including proteotoxic stress characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases.” Important advantages of compounds from the series of pyrrolyl- and indolylazine classes are a profitable synthesis technology and low toxicity. The obtained compounds were tested in cellular models of Alzheimer’s disease and secondary injuries after traumatic brain injury. In both cases, the new substances demonstrated a significant therapeutic effect, increasing the survival of neuronal cells. The most effective compound has been tested in living tissues of rats with secondary injuries after traumatic brain injury. According to scientists, the use of pyrrolylazine in rehabilitation therapy allowed the animals to avoid the appearance of movement disorders and degeneration of hippocampal neurons. The research team—made up of experts from the Institute of Cytology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Organic Synthesis of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Ural Federal University took part in the study—has been continued to study the mechanism of action of new compounds and is preparing for their preclinical testing. We’ll keep you updated on what happens next with this hopeful research.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/chemists-found-an-effective-remedy-for-aged-brain-diseases-ural-university/
"With money received from the stimulus bills, South Carolina State University decided that it wasn’t such a big deal if some of the students there didn’t finish paying their student loans. Last week, South Carolina’s only Historically Black College or University (HBCU) announced it would renounce their claim to around $9.8 million in incoming student loan repayments from the accounts of 2,500 continuing students after having received the difference from the federal government, offering vital relief to students trying to work them off in the hardships of the post-pandemic economy. “We are committed to providing these students with a clear path forward so they can continue their college education and graduate without the burden of financial debt caused by circumstances beyond their control,” said acting SCSU President Alexander Conyers. The accounts could be cleared after the university was able to access around $4 million from the Trump CARES Act, and another $5.8 from the American Rescue Plan, passed under Biden. The cleared accounts overwhelmingly belonged to students with very high existing balances, or who had not registered for the next semester as a result of outstanding debt. “This is a tremendous weight I won’t have to carry,” Romaun Myers, a junior at SCSU, told the . “I’m a first-generation college student, one of the only boys on my mom’s side of the family. I have to make it so I can provide for my family.” Other students mentioned the news was “a really big blessing” and brought “tears to [the] eyes,” and that it would allow them to “realize their dreams.” Freshman Leslie Young in the press release that without the cancellation she would have had to sit out the next semester due to outstanding account balances. “I was in a deep depression because school means everything to me.

"Researchers at UC San Francisco have successfully developed a “speech neuroprosthesis” that has enabled a man with severe paralysis to communicate in sentences—translating signals from his brain to the vocal tract directly into words that appear as text on a screen. The achievement builds on more than a decade of effort by UCSF neurosurgeon Edward Chang to develop a technology that allows people with paralysis to communicate even if they are unable to speak on their own. “To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of direct decoding of full words from the brain activity of someone who is paralyzed and cannot speak,” said Chang, who’s senior author on the study. “It shows strong promise to restore communication by tapping into the brain’s natural speech machinery.” Each year, thousands of people lose the ability to speak due to stroke, accident, or disease. With further development, the approach described in this study could one day enable these people to fully communicate. Previously, work in the field of communication neuroprosthetics has focused on restoring communication through spelling-based approaches to type out letters one-by-one in text. Chang’s study differs from these efforts in a critical way: his team is translating signals intended to control muscles of the vocal system for speaking words, rather than signals to move the arm or hand to enable typing. Chang said this approach taps into the natural and fluid aspects of speech and promises more rapid and organic communication. “With speech, we normally communicate information at a very high rate, up to 150 or 200 words per minute,” he said, noting that spelling-based approaches using typing, writing, and controlling a cursor are considerably slower and more laborious. “Going straight to words, as we’re doing here, has great advantages because it’s closer to how we normally speak.” Over the past decade, Chang’s progress toward this goal was facilitated by patients at the UCSF Epilepsy Center who were undergoing neurosurgery to pinpoint the origins of their seizures using electrode arrays placed on the surface of their brains. These patients, all of whom had normal speech, volunteered to have their brain recordings analyzed for speech-related activity. Early success with these patient volunteers paved the way for the current trial in people with paralysis. Previously, Chang and colleagues in the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences mapped the cortical activity patterns associated with vocal tract movements that produce each consonant and vowel. To translate those findings into speech recognition of full words, David Moses, PhD, a postdoctoral engineer in the Chang lab, developed new methods for real-time decoding of those patterns and statistical language models to improve accuracy. But their success in decoding speech in participants who were able to speak didn’t guarantee that the technology would work in a person whose vocal tract is paralyzed. “Our models needed to learn the mapping between complex brain activity patterns and intended speech,” said Moses. “That poses a major challenge when the participant can’t speak.” In addition, the team didn’t know whether brain signals controlling the vocal tract would still be intact for people who haven’t been able to move their vocal muscles for many years. “The best way to find out whether this could work was to try it,” said Moses. To investigate the potential of this technology in patients with paralysis, Chang partnered with colleague Karunesh Ganguly, an associate professor of neurology, to launch a study known as “BRAVO” (Brain-Computer Interface Restoration of Arm and Voice). The first participant in the trial is a man in his late 30s who suffered a devastating brainstem stroke more than 15 years ago that severely damaged the connection between his brain and his vocal tract and limbs. Since his injury, he has had extremely limited head, neck, and limb movements, and communicates by using a pointer attached to a baseball cap to poke letters on a screen. The participant, who asked to be referred to as BRAVO1, worked with the researchers to create a 50-word vocabulary that Chang’s team could recognize from brain activity using advanced computer algorithms. The vocabulary—which includes words such as “water,” “family,” and “good”—was sufficient to create hundreds of sentences expressing concepts applicable to BRAVO1’s daily life. For the study, Chang surgically implanted a high-density electrode array over BRAVO1’s speech motor cortex. After the participant’s full recovery, his team recorded 22 hours of neural activity in this brain region over 48 sessions and several months. In each session, BRAVO1 attempted to say each of the 50 vocabulary words many times while the electrodes recorded brain signals from his speech cortex. To translate the patterns of recorded neural activity into specific intended words, the other two lead authors of the study used custom neural network models, which are forms of artificial intelligence. When the participant attempted to speak, these networks distinguished subtle patterns in brain activity to detect speech attempts and identify which words he was trying to say. To test their approach, the team first presented BRAVO1 with short sentences constructed from the 50 vocabulary words and asked him to try saying them several times. As he made his attempts, the words were decoded from his brain activity, one by one, on a screen. Then the team switched to prompting him with questions such as “How are you today?” and “Would you like some water?” As before, BRAVO1’s attempted speech appeared on the screen. “I am very good,” and “No, I am not thirsty.” The team found that the system was able to decode words from brain activity at rate of up to 18 words per minute with up to 93 percent accuracy (75 percent median). Contributing to the success was a language model Moses applied that implemented an “auto-correct” function, similar to what is used by consumer texting and speech recognition software. Moses characterized the early trial results—which appear in the as a proof of principle. “We were thrilled to see the accurate decoding of a variety of meaningful sentences,” he said. “We’ve shown that it is actually possible to facilitate communication in this way and that it has potential for use in conversational settings.” Looking forward, Chang and Moses said they will expand the trial to include more participants affected by severe paralysis and communication deficits. The team is currently working to increase the number of words in the available vocabulary, as well as improve the rate of speech. Both said that while the study focused on a single participant and a limited vocabulary, those limitations don’t diminish the accomplishment. “This is an important technological milestone for a person who cannot communicate naturally,” said Moses, “and it demonstrates the potential for this approach to give a voice to people with severe paralysis and speech loss.” ( the video about this research below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/paralyzed-mans-brain-waves-turned-into-sentences-on-computer/
"Instead of shelling out for a water filtration plant, mussels’ constant filter feeding is being tested as a potential wide-scale application for microplastic clean-up in our oceans. Belying their humble evolutionary stature, the mussel can do something that humanity could only achieve by spending millions on equipment, and that is cleaning microplastics smaller than 5mm out of the ocean. A voracious filter feeder, mussels absorb microplastics and than excrete them, while doing no harm to the organism. Microplastics are devilish pollutants that can come from tire wear, fracture off long-floating plastic debris, or get pulled off artificial textiles and end up in the ocean via sewage. They’re so small that often the required fineness of a net in order to collect them ensures that any marine life, even tiny ones, will be collected as well. A near the Plymouth Marine Laboratory in England is looking to see how many mussels it would take to make a meaningful impact on microplastic pollution. A blog entry from a biologist at our EPA that one adult mussel can filter feed through 15 gallons of water a day, and that a 6-mile bed of mussels can remove 25 tons of particulate matter a year. The Plymouth trial is replicating an earlier experiment that placed around 300 mussels in a flow tank that fed them phytoplankton and microplastics. They collected around 25% of the microplastics that were in the water—a staggering 250,000 pieces per hour. The particles were deposited in the bivalve’s droppings which the researchers say could be used for biofuel because it’s full of carbon. This was funded by the Waitrose Plan Plastic, a grant program for plastic cleaning solutions funded by the sales of plastic carrier bags at Waitrose grocery stores in the UK. Out in the Plymouth Sound, the team monitoring the mussels keep them in clusters in buckets under which are suspended receptacles to ensure all the waste is collected and the microplastics can be disposed of properly. “The trials so far have been extremely promising and we’re very excited about the positive impact systems like these could potentially have on estuarine areas, particularly in places where microplastics might accumulate such as marinas, harbors or near wastewater treatment works,” said Professor Pennie Lindeque, Head of Science – Marine Ecology and Biodiversity, in a . While nanoplastics can pass through the mussel’s membranes and into their limited anatomy, the microplastics are too large to harm them at the levels they are currently found in the oceans. “This has been a really exciting experiment, because we always hoped that mussels would have the capacity to filter out microplastics, but they do it really well, and they do it without harming themselves,” Lindeque says.

"A crab fisherman was delighted after being surprised by a rare orange Melo pearl in his seafood lunch. 40-year-old Prasarnphon Phunwan took home a large sea snail he caught while trawling for crabs in Prachuap Khiri Khan in Thailand. The fisherman boiled the seafood for a meal, but while he was slicing off the cooked meat, he hit on something hard and found a pearl. He then took the bright yellow-orange pearl to his younger brother, who checked the internet, and told him it might be a type of expensive Melo. Fisherman Prasarnphon said: “My family had been fishing for generations but I believe our fate is about to change because of my lunch.” The precious gem is being kept by the family in a plastic container wrapped in a cotton ball, but has not yet been weighed. Officers from the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources and local fisheries department have been informed but they are yet to visit the family to check the authenticity of the pearl. Curious neighbors, however, have already flocked to their house to have a look at the pearl. Prasarnphon added that they will be ready to sell the pearl at the right price after it was checked by officials. He said: ‘We know that the pearl is expensive so we want to give it to the person at the right price after it has been checked.’ In February, trucker Monthian Jansuk found a similar pearl in Chonburi province, while fisherman Hatchai Niyomdecha stumbled upon the rare gem in Nakhon Si Thammarat in January. Hatchai was offered up to $351,000 for the 7.68-gram precious gem—so the most recent lucky fisherman could truly see his fortunes change quite soon. Melo pearls range from orange to tan to brown in color, with orange being the most expensive shade. They are usually found in South China Sea and Andaman Sea off the coast of Myanmar and are produced by predatory sea snails called Volutidae.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/prasarnphon-phunwan-thailand-fisherman-seafood-lunch/
"If one doesn’t want to use herbicides to control their lawn, what’s the alternative to constant mowing and hedge-trimming? Well, in olden days, they used goats. In fact, many organic landscapers today use goats, as they are living weed whackers, immune to all sorts of natural poisons and seemingly unfazed by thorns. They can eat poison oak as easy as we can eat a piece of celery. In Manhattan’s Riverside Park, two dozen goats have been unleashed upon untended and overgrown brush and weeds in order to avoid having to use chemicals, or spending thousands in labor costs. Onlookers gathered round to watch the calico-herd of animals charge into the park during the , as called it. “They chowed down on Japanese knotweed, they noshed on porcelain berry, they snacked on multiflora rose, they easily traversed the hard-to-reach terrain behind me and gulped down poison ivy without even giving it a second thought,” said Dan Garodnick, Riverside Park Conservancy president and CEO at the ceremonial day of deployment. “It’s healthy for the goats and it’s good for the environment. That’s farm to table.” Along with working much longer hours than landscapers, goats—according to Jordon Martins-Cihanek, son of the owner of Green Goats farm who provided the animals—actually neutralize a lot of the seeds of the various unwanted plants, preventing them from regrowing next year. The team of 24 goats will eventually be reduced down to five lucky landscapers: Skittles, Ms. Bo Peep, Chalupa, Mallemar, and Buckles, who will live in the park until August 24th, at which time the (G)reatest (O)f (A)ll (T)ime goat-grading competition will produce a winner, who presumably gets the next park all to themselves.

"Sometimes the distance between fortune, fame, and ruin is just a house fire away, as Los Angeles painter Richard Hutchins found out found after his studio in Santa Monica burned down. Thanks to the power of social media however, Richard also understands another distance—the one between homelessness and stardom. In a real-life riches-to-rags-to-riches story filled with more serendipity than a John Cusack movie, Richard went from living on the streets to being exhibited in Beverly Hills’ largest art gallery, to selling millions of dollars worth of his unique canvasses to people like Oprah, the rappers 2 Chaainz and Whiz Khalifa, and Philadelphia Phillies slugger Bryce Harper. “I’ve always asked God to give me the opportunity to present myself to the world, and it’s just something that drives me,” Richard told “My inspiration is people. I’m not trying to get rich, I just want to earn enough to leave something behind that I can continue to help people, [but] the world reached out tremendously.” It’s fair to say that as well-spoken as Richard is, ‘tremendously’ is an understatement. A once-famous artist who had painted canvasses for Marvin Gaye and Mohammed Ali, Richard knew the heights an artist could achieve, but just one month ago it would have been hard to imagine ever climbing to them again. This totally-L.A. story begins when Charlie “Rocket” Jabalay, founder of the Dream Machine Foundation, finished his career at 29 as a manager for hip-hop artists in Atlanta after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. “I wanted to chase my dream that I had since I was a kid,” Charlie told “That happens to us all; we bury a dream and build up something else, but I was facing death and I thought ‘if I’m going to die let me chase my dream,’ and my dream was to become a professional athlete.” “I lost 130 pounds and biked across America and did Iron Man and marathons and reversed my brain tumor. All my dreams came true, and that’s why I wanted to start making other peoples’ dreams come true. I had a conversation with God, and I asked ‘You’ve done so much for me, what can I do for you?’ And God spoke loud, he said ‘go give love.'” As enshrined forever on Charlie’s Instagram feed, he came across Richard Hutchins sitting on a cart in front of Ralphs, saying he used to be a famous artist and that his dream would be to walk into a museum and see a painting of his hanging on the wall. While Charlie and his foundation spent $2,000 to get Richard a canvass and some oils to paint with, Richard was being admitted to the emergency room. At 70-years old and battling cancer, thousands of stories have finished on that page, but not Richard’s. He managed to pull through and was discharged shortly after. “Out of nowhere” as Charlie described it, an old friend who just happened to operate the Cool HeART Gallery, the largest art galley in Beverly Hills, called the former athlete, and upon hearing about Richard simply offered to throw him a late-June art show alongside celebrity LA artists Ruben Rojas and Richard Orlinksi. “Charlie kept coming by saying ‘we have a surprise for you’ and every surprise got bigger and bigger and bigger, until I ended up on the red carpet in Beverly Hills,” says Richard. To drum up support for Richard’s exhibition appearance, Charlie’s created a for Richard to sell his art in order to try and get his life back in order. The results were staggering, with $50,000 dollars worth of original prints, canvasses, and commissions sold in the first 24 hours, doubling to $100,000 just a few days later. Once again, Charlie was there to capture all of the action on his Instagram. The look in Richard’s eyes says it all. Steve Harvey “I was homeless and know what Richard Hutchins is going through. I am honored to purchase his art. Let’s go Dream Machine!” Other celebrities like Trey Songz and Will Smith shared the story, the former noting, “this is amazing,” and even his hosting service Shopify produced a small video about the instantaneous life-transformation happening in real time. “I came from South Georgia; aged six I was in the cotton field working after school, and during break I would take the brown bags and I would pull them apart and use sticks from the fire to start drawing stick men,” says Richard, reflecting on his journey. “It’s my opportunity now to pay it forward.” Now Richard has a money manager, a health coach to ensure he doesn’t end up in the ER again any time soon, a new car, and a new career, all without losing any sense of where he could have been. “About a minute before Charlie pulled up, I stood up and got ready to walk away, but this particular day which was Easter, I stood up and something pushed me back down,” explains Richard. “If I had left that minute I would have never seen Charlie.” “I don’t want to draw attention to myself,  I want to draw attention to the problem. I call the president, the vice-president, I say ‘come to Skid Row,’ that’s my dream—to use my power to help better this place; to help better Los Angeles.” Richard has since established a foundation named after his late mother for the purpose of providing scholarships to kids who can’t afford to go to school. Richard’s canvasses are next on the road to Miami, where they are to be exhibited alongside those of Richard’s hero, Andy Warhol. Within a week of going from homelessness to the 1%, Richard was working to give as much back as he could. It’s a story that helps remind us of so many things—of compassion, of belief in the human spirit, in modesty, and it reminds us to never, never give up on our dreams.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/painter-richard-hutchins-was-homeless-now-hes-the-top-artist-in-la/
"A New York photographer acquired a new lease on night in the Catskills during the draconian state lockdowns by suspending a white sheet in her yard illuminated with black lights and waiting to see who shows up. She is just one of many “moth-ers,” enthusiasts of the butterfly’s generally nocturnal cousin, that are taking to fields, porches, and patios for —a large citizen science project to catalogue the biodiversity of moths. During the lockdowns, reports of Americans picking up all manner of curious hobbies while self-isolating were all over the news channels. From trying to , to inside their coat closet, they kept themselves busy. Carla Rhodes is no different. With her white sheet and camera, she would stay out to between 1-4 am in the anticipation of seeing beautiful moths in her home of Woodstock, New York. Falling in love with the pink and yellow fuzz of the rosy maple moth, the moonlight-white wings of the giant leopard moth, all covered in black spots, and the yellow stripes of the Anna tiger moth, there was always the feeling, according to Rhodes, that maybe tonight she would see a new species. “It blows my mind just knowing that many creatures come out of nowhere; they’re all there just waiting to be seen,” Rhodes told who were reporting on her adventures. “I don’t think moths are appreciated in the way that they should be.” Rhodes isn’t the only one enjoying moths, as the COVID-19 lockdowns brought British moth-ers out in force as well. reports that registered moth sightings rose by a third since the lockdowns began, which for many shires meant first time sightings. In Cheshire, seven species never before registered in the county were recorded including the light feathered rustic and beautiful marbled moths. Several new species were also sighted in Cornwall, while in Yorkshire alone mothing was 25% more common last year. Dr. David Roy of UK Center for Ecology and Hydrology stated that “Moths are an integral part of ecosystems and are excellent indicators of biodiversity and quality of habitats. By submitting more records, the public is improving scientists’ understanding of the impacts of environmental changes on moth populations and also British wildlife. This then provides the necessary evidence to inform conservation action to protect habitats, and the species they support.” Smithsonian concurs on this point, adding that the more citizen scientists report butterfly sightings the faster policies to protect them can be implemented, and the more effective they’ll be. Spanning from July 17th to the 25th, National Moth Week invites moth-ers and mothing enthusiasts to to several organizations that gather citizen science data, such as iNaturalist, Field Guide, Nature Share, or the Encyclopedia of Life. Along with providing excellent resources for identifying the fuzzy flyers that show up in your garden, you can register your favorite places aa a mothing site; helpful to scientists for all different reasons. The organizers also have an events map so you can meet other mothing enthusiasts in your area. There’s no reason to give butterflies all the credit as joy-inducing colorful insects, as in addition to the pollinating services of the moths, their colors are just as bright, you only have to stay out late to see them.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/national-mothing-week-and-the-beauty-of-moths/
"You’re on vacation and somehow, your family dog goes missing. You search and you pray and then you search some more. As the days go by with no word, your brain may tell you it’s time to give up hope—but in your heart you never do. And sometimes that hope is rewarded. The Battista family of New York City was on vacation in Ocean City, Maryland when their 2-year-old Boston terrier Fisher went AWOL on July 4, 2020. The Battistas immediately blanketed the area with missing posters, barraged social media, and even got Fisher face-time on a local floating billboard. With no leads, the family decided to remain in the area for an extended stay. They hired a tracker and even went so far as consulting with an “animal communicator” in hopes of tapping into Fisher’s whereabouts using doggy ESP—all to no avail. The family also set up a #findfisher Facebook page, which quickly gathered 8,000 followers, and launched an online fundraiser to raise awareness and aid them in their efforts to bring their beloved fur baby home. “We’ve alerted Ocean City police, fire, beach patrol, postal service, Scopes, lifeguards—you name it!” Matthew Battista wrote to Fisher’s . “Signs have been posted from the inlet to 77th St, and we have extended our canvassing to the nearby Delaware beaches of Fenwick, Bethany, Dewey, and Reheboth. We’ve extended our stay in Ocean City and arranged to bring in a professional dog tracker, in addition to making continuous searching trips in car, on foot, and on bike.” Although they eventually were forced to return home to New York minus Fisher, the Battistas refused to give up. But even with the massive media blitz, it seemed Fisher had pulled a full-on Houdini. Undaunted, the Battistas kept the wheels of the Internet grapevine turning, refusing to let the details of Fisher’s disappearance be forgotten. As a result, Fisher became something of a media darling in absentia. And that’s surely part of the reason the Battistas’ perseverance paid off. On April 20, 2021, 290 days after Fisher made his unauthorized Independence Day exit, Baltimore City resident Wayne Horn was performing maintenance on his motorcycle when he noticed a stray dog in the road. “I called him over because cars speed up and down my road,” Horn told . “He came over to me, so we gave him water. He laid down and was content, he didn’t want to leave.” When a friend of Horn’s posted pix of the found pooch to Facebook the responses of “That’s Fisher!” came back faster than a boomerang. Although the findings were later confirmed by a micro-ship scan, Elissa Battista recognized Fisher immediately. “From the moment I saw the photos I knew it was him from the markings and his little tongue sticking out,” she posted to Facebook. The reunion was quickly arranged. The Battistas had some local friends pick him up from the Horns, and then Elissa made the five-hour trip to retrieve Fisher and bring him home. Apart from minor signs of possible frostbite, Fisher was in excellent shape. The Battistas are so thankful to have Fisher back, they’re now doing their part to pay it forward, once again by using the powers of social media for good. The Facebook page formerly known as “Find Fisher” has been transformed into “ ” and is now dedicated to helping other pet parents locate their lost four-legged loved ones. The family has also pledged to apply any leftover funds from their GoFundMe to the charity of Fisher’s choice once he was safely back with his family. While we’re still awaiting “woof” on what that might be, the takeaways from this story seem clear: Social media and microchips are powerful tools in reuniting lost pets with their families. Using both is the best chance of a happy outcome. And while no reunion is guaranteed, if you’re thinking of giving up hope—don’t. Because more than anything, as Fisher’s 10-month walk-about proves, hope has no expiration date.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/terrier-lost-while-on-vacation-for-290-days-found-through-social-media/

"A group of school kids made a special wheelchair stroller so a disabled dad can take his newborn son out for a walk. 37-year-old Jeremy King has impaired mobility following an operation to remove a brain tumour in 2017. He was concerned how he would manage to help his expecting wife Chelsie after she gave birth. Chelsie, a teacher at Bullis School in Maryland recruited the help of her students who designed the WheeStroll—a child seat which attaches to a wheelchair. Just a few weeks after the couple’s son Phoenix was born, Jeremy was able to take him out for walks with the pram-wheelchair hybrid. Jeremy said: “I was emotional and elated because something like this really increases independence with my child. “It has allowed me to experience things that I would not have been able to do before having the WheeStroll. It allows us as a family to have more freedom of movement.” Middle school theatre instructor Chelsie said: “Being able to see Jeremy have some independence with our son is a gift. “This surgery changed our lives drastically and we have worked very hard to accept, learn, and overcome those challenges but parenting is a whole new set of challenges. “It has given us the ability to do something simple like take a walk as a family; something that a lot of families don’t have to think twice about.” Just three months after getting engaged to Chelsie, Jeremy underwent an eight-hour surgery for a brain tumour in October 2017 which resulted in impaired mobility. He said: “I was very concerned with the safety of myself and our child especially with Chelsie having to potentially support both of us. “It played on my mind constantly which is why it was important for us to find things to help.” The couple searched for a product to help Jeremy but with no luck, Chelsie recruited the help of her colleague, innovation and technology lab coordinator Matt Zigler. She asked him if he could design something to attach to Jeremy’s wheelchair to allow him to hold their child while on the go. Chelsie said: He had the idea to throw this to his ‘making for social good’ class and I thought that was an amazing idea.” The school kids conducted interviews with the family and the fire department, who provide infant car seat installation training. The school team purchased or 3D printed all the parts required, and even borrowed a wheelchair from the school nurse as a prototype.

"No one writes romance novels about geese, but maybe they should. Unlike many of their fickle human counterparts, geese mate for life. So, when they honk, “ ’Til death do us part,” they mean it—which would explain why when a Canada goose named Arnold wound up in the hospital, his Mrs. marched up to the threshold demanding visitation rights. The pair of wild geese are longtime residents at a pond close to the Cape Wildlife Center (CWC) in Barnstable, Massachusetts. Though well-known to the facility’s crew, the avian inhabitants have generally declined human interaction, preferring to keep to their own company. When the crew noticed Arnold was limping and injured, however, they stepped in to intervene. After a literal wild goose chase that eventually ended in his capture, an exam revealed the wounded gander had two open fractures on one of his feet, likely caused by an underwater predator. With the webbing and skin pulled away leaving the bones exposed, an operation to repair the damage was in order. The following day, as they were prepping Arnold for surgery, staff members heard a faint, inexplicable tapping at their door. “We turned to see that his mate had waddled up onto the porch and was attempting to break into our clinic,” Cape Wildlife Center posted to their . “She had somehow located him and was agitated that she could not get inside.” Once she’d tracked him down, Arnold’s stalwart missus stood watch throughout the entire procedure, refusing to budge from her vantage point by the doors. In post-op after the successful procedure, Arnold was placed in close proximity to his grateful spouse. The natural order was soon restored as she quickly settled in to attend to the needs of her still-wobbly hubby. “His mate immediately calmed down and began to groom him through the door,” CWC wrote. “They both seemed much more at ease in each other’s presence.” Although it will take some weeks for Arnold to recuperate, he’s expected to make a full recovery. When he’s deemed sound, the staff will return him to the wild, and then he and his mate can get back to the business of living their honking happily ever after.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/goose-spouses-surgery-massachusetts-cape-wildlife-center/
"Attempting to save some of the 1.9 million people who die from blood loss every year, researchers at MIT are using barnacles as inspiration to craft a glue that can seal a wound in just 15-seconds. Barnacles are strange old creatures which can glom onto virtually anything in the ocean, whether that’s the smooth metal hull of a ship, the flexible porous skin of a whale, or the craggy surface of a rock. It was drawing inspiration from the barnacles’ oil that the team came up with the potentially-groundbreaking substance. Whether in an operating theater or administration of first aid, rapid blood loss is a hugely frightening situation. Wound adhesives tend not to work well with major injuries. They rely on coagulants which can take minutes to work, time the patient may not have. Furthermore, they rely on dry-enough skin to be able to hold a wound closed; again hardly the ideal conditions when a patient is bleeding heavily, or if you have to close an internal wound. Hyunwoo Yuk, a mechanical engineering scientist at MIT, and his colleagues based their barnacle-inspired glue on the cocktail of lipids (fats) that . This oil they secrete sweeps away contaminants, and primes the surface for glomming onto with a bio-cement that would otherwise not take as well if the surface wasn’t cleared before hand. When secreted onto a cut in the heart of a rat, it stopped the blood-loss and , and proved to withstand 8-times the breaking pressure compared to commercial alternatives. “My overall impression of this material is that it’s incredible,” says Hanjay Wang to , a resident in Stanford University’s Cardiothoracic Surgery Department who was not involved in . “It definitely fills a need, especially in the emergency setting, when you need to just get control.” Another surgeon said she’d never seen anything like it in her career. : There are still some details that must be flushed out, such as how long the bond lasts. Ideally it should last even after the wound has healed on its own, but not forever, and the toxicity levels still need to be carefully calculated. Another physician speaking to Wired about the trials brought up a problem which the glue solves that is simply not being met by any other product in the medical tech market. “With aging populations, you have more and more patients that have either acquired bleeding disorders or are ultimately on blood thinners; the problem of bleeding, and bleeding control is substantial,” Christoph Nabzdyk, a cardiologist and critical care physician from Mayo. : Dr. Yuk has an interesting way of looking at problems, reasoning the animal kingdom’s principal task is survival, so whatever you’re looking to do, heal, or fix, there’s probably an organism that has already solved it. His use of barnacles as inspiration typifies that behavior, and could very well revolutionize the medical field. :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/barnacle-glue-inspired-a-paste-that-can-stop-heavy-bleeding-in-seconds/

Nandi accepted the invitation and traveled with her parents from Ipswich, England, where she’s been playing since she was five-years-old. It was a bright spot during the pandemic in August 2020 when she made a video challenging Grohl to an . Her drumming is so superlative that multiple friends of the former Nirvana drummer were texting him, saying he had to respond with a video of his own.

"Another hurricane, another power outage? In the state of Louisiana, one apartment complex is keeping the lights on—a beacon of hope in New Orleans. St. Peter Residential, which opened one month before the pandemic began, built in that emergency functionality using an 8-hour solar battery and a panel array on its roof—and it kept the units running after Hurricane Ida made landfall. At $7.4 million, the 45,000 square foot building is the first net-zero emission apartment complex in the state, meaning it offsets or removes as much power as it generates onsite. Designed as “a calming oasis intent on building community in a dense urban environment,” the 50-unit, mixed-income living spaces are served by a microgrid of 450 solar panels that generate electricity on demand, and stored excess power in a battery located in the parking lot. St. Peter was designed to cultivate a community (with the inclusion of a wellness center for yoga and meditation and common event and outdoor spaces), and importantly, half of the 50 units—29 affordable apartments and 21 market-rate units—are reserved for veterans. The microgrid has now seen three storms: Hurricane Zeta which took out power in the area last October, Winter Storm Uri which resulted in the same thing, and now Hurricane Ida. Lauren Avioli is the director of housing development for the nonprofit SBP, which oversaw the funding and construction of St. Peter. SBP, named after St. Bernard Project, was founded by Zack Rosenburg and Liz McCartney after the couple (now married) volunteered in the St. Bernard parish following the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina. Since then, SBP has rebuilt homes for more than 2,000 families and hired as the architect to design this innovative complex that provides residents with extremely low energy bills. : “It’s not just post-disaster emergency power,” Avioli told . “It’s also helping people at the property save money on a blue sky day because we can use some of the energy that’s being generated by the solar panels to run the building.” It doesn’t work all the time, however. For example, on Tuesday when the power went off it was cloudy, and the system couldn’t deliver as much electricity as the building managers would have hoped for. But the days after were sunny and powerless in New Orleans, except for , many of whom have transitioned from lower-income housing, or even from homelessness. believes it’s a no-brainer as far as city planning goes, to place these resilient solar microgrids on as many rooftops as possible—especially if, as some scientists’ believe, global climate change is making storms like Ida hit harder and more often than normal. Cities would not only be doing their best to keep the power on, but to mitigate their share of emissions going up into the atmosphere. : The St. Peter project is a shining example of how developers and cities can commit to helping find solutions to eradicating both poverty and climate change emissions that are exacerbating such storms.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/solar-powered-apartment-in-new-orleans-kept-the-lights-on-through-ida/
"Truly astonishing behavior has just been recorded in a pair of wild Goffin’s Cockatoos, who like expert bandits, manufactured an entire three-piece set of tools to burgle their way into the pit of a mango. Caught wild and held for a short time in a research aviary in Indonesia, it is the kind of behavior that typifies the most advanced tool users in the animal kingdom, and solidifies the Goffin’s Cockatoo as one of the avian group’s major bird-brainiacs. Perhaps the most delightful part of this discovery was that it happened serendipitously, while Mark O’Hara and Berenika Mioduszewska were studying a new group of wild birds in their “I’d just turned away, and when I looked back, one of the birds was making and using tools,” O’Hara, of the Messerli Research Institute in Vienna Austria, tells . “I couldn’t believe my eyes!” Before the capture of the canny cockatoos, O’Hara and Mioduszewska had spent an eye-watering 900 hours watching them feed high in the canopy without ever once witnessing tool use. A few other bird species, like the New Caledonian Crow and Hyacinth Macaw, have been documented making stick tools, and even hook tools. Goffin’s Cockatoos are well-documented as intuitive social learners that can . The Messerli Institute has, in fact, shown how one individual was able to That, however, was just one tool, for one purpose. This new observation is the first time any bird species has been seen creating and using a set of tools in a specific order : While researching the cockatoos, the team would regularly provide them with food they found about the island, including the wawai, or sea mango, which is poisonous to humans but nutritious for birds. At the center of the mango a hard pit protects a large, nutritious seed. For awhile it seemed there was nothing special about the bunch of birds they captured, but two individuals, upon getting their talons onto the pits, began to craft not one, not two, but a set of three different tools to work their way into the fruit pit. “Repeated provisions of the fruit allowed us to analyze the behavior in detail, and to collect and trace some of the manufactured tools,” explains O’Hara in a video abstract. “Using a structure-from-motion technique we could create 3D models and gather detailed measurements such as size and volume…[of the tools used]. Based on the physical properties, the function analysis classified three types of tools; we discovered that each tool type seemed to serve a different purpose.” : With a thicker section of branch, they would use their beak to push and pry open one end of the pit, while with a second, medium-fine implement, they punctured the membrane surrounding the seed. Lastly, they would make a scoop-like tool which when maneuvered with their mouth, allowed them to extract the seed material. This making of tool sets has been seen in humans, chimpanzees, and capuchin monkeys; full stop. Chimps use between two and five tools for termite and beehive raids. Tool use has been proposed in the parrot lineage as having a strong captivity bias, so whether the behavior was tied to their stay in the aviary or whether they use tools in the wild is something O’Hara and Mioduszewska discuss in their “If they had a genetic predisposition to use tools, all the birds would do it,” O’Hara tells Science. “Since only a few make these, it’s more likely they invented them independently,” which would be even more likely as the two individuals displayed immediate and exceptional proficiency. : They believe that it is not species-wide but acquired by individuals through opportunistic innovations, or by watching and learning from others. A number of intriguing details emerge in the Discussion section, such as that tools tended to be crafted to specifications before use, rather than through a trial-and-error process. Another detail is that around the island they had found fruit underneath wawai trees that appeared to had been foraged on with tools. One actually contained a wooden fragment inserted into the fissure of the pit, which provided enough years go by, could be the first-ever instance of “avian-archaeology.” : O’Hara and Mioduszewska’s paper is filled with videos that are stunning to watch, and can be .",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cockatoos-first-ever-bird-to-make-and-use-tool-sets/
"Our partner Rob Brezsny provides his weekly wisdom to enlighten our thinking and motivate our mood. Rob’s , is a syndicated weekly column appearing in over a hundred publications. He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): “I often wonder who I am and where is my country and where do I belong and why was I ever born at all,” wrote Virgo author (1890–1979). I don’t think you will be agitated by those questions during the next eight weeks, Virgo. In fact, I suspect you will feel as secure in your identity as you have in a long time. You will enjoy prolonged clarity about your role in the world, the nature of your desires, and how you should plan your life for the next two years. If for some inexplicable reason you’re not already enjoying these developments, stop what you’re doing and meditate on the probability that I am telling you the bold truth. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Several states in the US have statutes prohibiting blasphemy and such cursing could theoretically get you fined in Massachusetts, South Carolina, and Wyoming. In the coming days, it’s best to proceed carefully in places like those, since you’ve been authorized by cosmic forces to curse more often and more forcefully than usual. Why? Because you need to summon vivid and intense protests in the face of influences that may be inhibiting and infringing on your soul’s style. You have a poetic license to rebel against conventions that oppress you. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Everyone dreams at least three dreams per night. In a year, your subconscious mind generates over 1,100 dreams. About this remarkable fact, novelist writes, “Dreaming is not merely an act of coded communication. It is also an aesthetic activity, a game that is a value in itself. To dream about things that have not happened is among humanity’s deepest needs.” I bring this to your attention, Scorpio, because September is Honor Your Dreams Month. To celebrate, I suggest the following experiments. 1. Every night before sleep, write down a question you’d like your dreams to respond to. 2. Keep a notebook by your bed and transcribe at least one dream each time you sleep. 3. In the morning, have fun imagining what the previous night’s dreams might be trying to communicate to you. 4. Say prayers of gratitude to your dreams, thanking them for their provocative, entertaining stories. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): In her autobiography , Sagittarian actor expresses grief about how she and a loved one failed to communicate essential truths to each other. I propose we regard her as your anti-role model for the rest of 2021. Use her error as your inspiration. Make emotionally intelligent efforts to talk about unsaid things that linger like ghostly puzzles between you and those you care about. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): “I could do with a bit more excess,” writes author . “From now on I’m going to be immoderate—and volatile,” she vows. “I shall enjoy loud music and lurid poetry. I shall be rampant.” Let me be clear, Capricorn: I’m not urging you to be immoderate, volatile, excessive, and rampant every day for the rest of your long life. But I think you will generate health benefits and good fortune if you experiment with that approach in the coming weeks. Can you think of relatively sane, sensible ways to give yourself this salubrious luxury? AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): While wading through the internet, I found a provocative quote attributed to the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. He supposedly said, “My ultimate goal is to look totally hot, but not be unapproachable.” I confess that in the past I have sometimes been fooled by fake quotes, and this is probably one. Still, it’s amusing to entertain the possibility that such an august personage as Socrates, a major influencer of Western thought, might say something so cute and colloquial. Even if he didn’t say it, I like the idea of blending ancient wisdom with modern insights, seriousness with silliness, thoughtful analysis with good fun. In accordance with astrological omens, I recommend you experiment with comparable hybrids in the coming weeks. (PS: One of your goals should be to look totally hot, but not be unapproachable.) PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): “If you don’t know what you want,” writes Piscean novelist , “you end up with a lot you don’t.” Very true! And right now, it’s extra important to keep that in mind. During the coming weeks, you’ll be at the peak of your ability to attract what you want and need. Wouldn’t you prefer to gather influences you really desire—as opposed to those for which you have mild or zero interest? Define your wants and needs very precisely. ARIES (March 21-April 19): Aries poet wrote, “I’ve learned to value failed conversations, missed connections, confusions. What remains is what’s unsaid, what’s underneath. Understanding on another level of being.” In the coming weeks, I suggest you adopt her perspective as you evaluate both past and present experiences. You’re likely to find small treasures in what you’d assumed were wastelands. You may uncover inspiring clues in plot twists that initially frustrated you. Upon further examination, interludes you dismissed as unimportant or uninteresting could reveal valuable wrinkles. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): After studying your astrological omens, I’ve decided to offer you inspiration from the ancient Roman poet Catullus. I hope the extravagant spirit of his words will free you to be greedy for the delights of love and affection. wrote, “Give me a thousand kisses, then a hundred; then another thousand, then a second hundred; then yet another thousand.” I’ll add the following to Catullus’s appeal: Seek an abundance of endearing words, sweet favors and gifts, caresses and massages, and help with your work. If there’s no one in your life to provide you with such blessings, give them to yourself. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Gemini author writes that the Old Uzbek language was rich in expressions about crying. There were “words for wanting to cry and not being able to, for loudly crying like thunder in the clouds, for crying in gasps, for weeping inwardly or secretly, for crying ceaselessly in a high voice, for crying in hiccups, and for crying while uttering the sound ‘hay hay.'” I recommend all of these to you in the coming days, as well as others you might dream up. Why? It’s prime time to seek the invigorating release and renewal that come from shedding tears generated by deep and mysterious feelings. CANCER (June 21-July 22): A blogger named MythWoven imagines an “alternate universe where I literally go to school forever (for free) so I can learn about art and literature and history and languages for 100 years. No job skills. No credit requirements. No student loans. Just learning.” I have longings like hers. There’s an eternal student within me that wants to be endlessly surprised with exciting information about interesting subjects. I would love to be continually adding fresh skills and aptitudes to my repertoire. In the coming weeks, I will give free rein to that part of me. I recommend you do the same, my fellow Cancerian. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): In 2016, the International Garden Photograph of the Year depicted lush lupine flowers in New Zealand. The sea of tall purple, pink, and blue blooms was praised as “an elegant symphony” and “a joy to behold.” What the judges didn’t mention is that lupine is an invasive species in New Zealand. It forces native plant species out of their habitat, which in turn drives away native animal species, including birds like the wrybill, black stilt, and banded dotterel. Is there a metaphorically comparable phenomenon in your life, Leo? Problematic beauty? Some influence that’s both attractive and prickly? A wonderful thing that can also be troublesome? The coming weeks will be a favorable time to try to heal the predicament.

"We all know 2020 was a rough year and many people turned to thinking about what they could do to improve the situation for themselves or for others. One of those people was Kimberly Wybenga. She wanted to brighten the outlook for friends and family and wondered ‘who doesn’t love a compliment’? She bought 10 small jars and wrote out compliments for 10 friends that she thought could use a dose of happiness. Just writing out the compliments brought her joy and she bought 20 more jars to spread the love even further. She didn’t stop there, either. She bought an additional 20 jars bringing the total number of kindness gift jars to 50—and did it all anonymously. Altogether, she hand-wrote 1,750 compliments! ( ) One recipient commented, “Sometimes the universe knows exactly what you need. This touched me to the core. The thoughtfulness that went into this is amazing.” Another said, “I hope whoever did give this to me realizes just how much I needed this gift. I’ve opened it and read one when I needed it, but tonight I dumped it all out and read every single nice thing this person said about me.” : “I know everyone is dealing with some kind of struggle and I just thought it would be nice to support them any way I could,” Wybenga told GNN, “even if I didn’t know what they were going through.” The 38 year-old tried to deliver her boxes of hope anonymously, signing “a friend” at the bottom of each card. She mailed some packages and hand-delivered others that lived closer to her home in Colorado. The ones that she hand-delivered, she even tried to disguise herself so if people had cameras, they wouldn’t know it was her. Dressed in a black jacket, her long blue hair pulled up into a beanie, and a mask, she placed the boxes on doorsteps. She even parked around corners or down streets so people wouldn’t see her car. : All the effort to remain anonymous didn’t work much of the time because Wybenga’s handwriting was recognized by multiple people. Others looked up her zip code on the package or did some sleuthing and discovered it was her. “Seeing other people happy brought me so much joy,” she said. “The world is a better place with all my friends and family.” She decided to now share the story publicly, in the hope that it would inspire someone else to spread kindness.

"The future of travel is bold, with a boat-plane hybrid set to transform short distance ferry services. From the to to self-driving cars to, now, this, the is an electric transport plane that can do 180 mph, or around six-times the speed of a ferry, and with double the range of electric aircraft, but with half the manufacturing costs. All these pros are down to its unique design as essentially a trio of vehicles in one, which the company believes will seize control of a market for short flights/ferry routes such as LA to Santa Barbara or San Francisco, or New York to Boston, with maybe Washington, D.C. thrown in there as well. When loading and offloading passengers, the seaglider rests on the sea like a normal seaplane or boat. When operating within the crowded waters of a port, the seaglider deploys its hydrofoils, matching its impressive propulsion with the maneuverability of the foils below. Once on the open sea, the foils are withdrawn and it takes on the aspects of a “wing-in-ground effect vehicle,” a design invented all the way back in the 1960s, that uses high speeds to hover just above the surface of the water. ( ) So far REGENT’s founders almost $10 million from investors, which have included Mark Cuban and Peter Thiel. Wing-in-ground effect vehicles are actually considered boats, and subject to maritime, rather than aviation laws. In this way the seaglider can skirt around current technology limitations of battery-powered electric motors and offer truly zero-emissions transport. The company imagines that battery advances currently being pursued should raise the range of the seaglider to 500 miles from 180 miles in the not-too-distant future. The company has received statements of intent worth $465 million, have acquired the sponsor dollars of operators Brittany Ferries, Goombay Air, and SplitExpress, and expect to have a quarter-sized prototype by the end of the year, and a full-sized prototype operational in 2023.

"Four commercially-fished tuna species are on a significant path to recovery thanks to the enforcement of regional fishing regulations over the last ten years, according to yesterday’s update of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. “Today’s IUCN Red List update is a powerful sign that, despite increasing pressures on our oceans, species can recover if states truly commit to sustainable practices,” said Dr Bruno Oberle, IUCN Director General. States and others are now gathered at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Marseille, France, to work towards binding targets that will increase and maintain biodiversity across the planet. “The newly released results on the status of commercial tunas emphasize that sustainable fisheries are possible,” said Dr Beth Polidoro, Associate Professor at Arizona State University and Red List coordinator. : In the Red List update, the seven most commercially fished tuna species were reassessed. Four moved in a positive direction thanks to countries enforcing more sustainable fishing quotas and successfully combatting illegal fishing: “The take home message for the general public is that things like albacore tuna—which is the one that is widely on supermarket shelves—is of least concern now,” Craig Hilton-Taylor, who heads the Red List, told BBC News. “It means that what they’re eating has been sustainably caught and is well managed.” : Despite global improvement at the species level, some regional tuna stocks remain depleted. For example, while the larger, eastern population of Atlantic bluefin tuna, which originates in the Mediterranean, has increased by at least 22% over the last four decades, the species’ smaller native western Atlantic population, which spawns in the Gulf of Mexico, has declined by more than half in the same period. “These Red List assessments are proof that sustainable fisheries approaches work, with enormous long-term benefits for livelihoods and biodiversity,” said Dr Bruce Collette, Chair of the IUCN SSC Tuna and Billfish Group. “Tuna species migrate across thousands of kilometers, so coordinating their management globally is also key.” :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/iucn-reports-4-tuna-species-on-path-to-recovery/
"A personalized, mRNA vaccine, given to patients with particular kinds of aggressive cancers could leverage the immune system of the patient to kill the cancer on its own, and in doing so usher in a new epoch of cancer treatment. Messenger RNA (ribonucleic acid) vaccines were what sparked the COVID-19 vaccine drives, as Pfizer and Moderna adapted the technology to create an emergency treatment to train the body to fight off the viral spike protein. What most of us won’t know however, is that the mRNA vaccines were originally in development for aggressive cancer types. Molly Cassidy, a mother studying for the Arizona Bar exam, is living proof that while the approach isn’t a panacea, it can clear away some of the most dreadful and fast cancers we know of. After being diagnosed with head and neck cancer, she underwent surgery and chemotherapy. However it was only ten days after finishing chemo that she found a marble-like bump on her collarbone from the cancer’s swift return. Later examinations found it had spread from her ear all the way to her lungs, and she was told to get her affairs in order. Cassidy she was eligible to join a clinical trial at the University of Arizona, testing an mRNA vaccine personalized to the cancer mutations of the host. By 27 weeks, Cassidy had received nine vaccine doses paired with an immunotherapy drug, and her CT scans were clear: the cancer had left her body. A personalized medicine approach to disease is challenging, however it could be said that the rise of cancer and of so many other diseases across the west is a result of the broader Western-health sector adopting a once-size fits all (or one-pill fits all) approach to everything from cancer to diet to mental health. Precision or personalized medicine is becoming a little more common now, with many paying more attention to genetic phenotypes and other biomarkers before drafting a therapy plan. This approach recently broke ground in a huge way and the USDA is using artificial intelligence based on demographics and other information to Tailor-made mRNA vaccines are an exciting form of personalized medicine to treat cancer, and involve taking a tissue sample from the patient’s tumor and analyzing it for mutations. This not only hones the immune system into the cancerous cells, but differentiates them from healthy, non-cancerous cells. The result is that the messenger RNA creates proteins shed from the exterior of the tumor and brings immune cells like T cells up to speed on how to fight it. “One of the things cancer does is it can turn on signals to tell the immune system to quiet down so the cancer is not detected,” explains Daniel Anderson, a biotech scientist at MIT, to . “The goal of an mRNA vaccine is to alert and gear up the immune system to go after the characteristic features of tumor cells and attack them.” Currently, phase-one clinical trials are running for metastatic melanoma, GI-tract cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic and ovarian cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. One of the most exciting things, even in these early days of mRNA cancer vaccines, is that they will offer a chance at survival for advanced and incurable cancers, not only because they have the potential to be very effective, but also because patients, like in Cassidy’s case, will have no other options. It’s likely the personalized mRNA vaccines will in practice be paired with —a breakthrough class of treatment that won the Nobel Prize in 2018. Similar to stem cell treatment, a patient’s T cells are drawn out before being multiplied in a lab, trained on the target cancer cell, and then reintroduced to help fight off the cancer.

Akin to a town crier, or some other mainstay of a Middle Ages-set period piece, the City Poet has only been an official position since the turn of the 21st century. As quaint is it may seem, the job is a serious one, for upon his or her shoulders rests the responsibility for composing funerary poems for those who die anonymously, unclaimed by friends or family. In an exploration of the Lonely Funeral Foundation, a collective of poets that work to ensure every individual who falls through the cracks of Dutch society has some kind of memorial service, published on the , Boston, the reader learns of a stark yet moving tradition that is both modern and rustic, and speaks to the responsibility of a society in the 21st century. A City Poet is as “a remunerated professional with clear job requirements and term duration. He or she is usually appointed by the City Council for a limited time with the objective of writing poems about the city they come from—for the good and the bad times, but also for regular or random events, official occasions and ceremonies, with the objective to inform and entertain the citizens.” The Lonely Funerals concept was put forward by one such City Poet—Bart Droog of Groningen, in 2001, after which it spread to other Dutch cities and to those in Belgium, another country that started the City Poet idea around the same years. In Amsterdam, where a dozen people might die unclaimed per year, the City Poet has to, at a moment’s notice, be ready to transform himself from artist to sleuth. Details about these people can often be scant—presenting a huge challenge to someone trying to write a poem, much less one in memory of a life. The City Poet must be ready to collect records of lodging, employment, and immigration, or talk to neighbors and others that might have interacted with the person. There is a simple prize for a yearly contest to see which poet composed the most moving lonely funeral poem, organized by Ger Fritz, a former employee of the Amsterdam Department of Funerals, and one of the originators of the concept. “People are story machines… What the Lonely Funeral does is return stories to people who have somehow lost theirs along the way,” an Amsterdam poet Frank Starik, told the Ploughshares Blog. Also speaking with , poet Hester Knibbe remarked at the difficulty of the job: “How do you write a poem about someone you don’t know anything about… ? It’s like a word that just won’t come: you describe, you try to imagine a basic life, trying to force it into some highs and lows.” Sometimes details are so scant, the poets must fight the urge to fill in gaps with recognizable themes from literature or from the poet’s own life. Pioneer Droog refers to the Lonely Funeral Foundation as the “social task of the poet,” and indeed it’s considered a vital civil service akin to social insurance or other benefits; that through honoring those the society let down, those who remain can perhaps work to better it.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/city-poets-in-belgium-and-holland-are-responsible-for-writing-poems-for-unclaimed-dead/
"A plumber is flush with success after he landed a record deal when a music mogul heard him singing—while he fitted his bathroom. 49-year-old Kev Crane spent six weeks installing a new suite at the home of Paul Conneally—completely unaware he was the owner of a record label. Kev would spend his working days singing along to his favourite tunes on the radio including David Bowie and Meat Loaf. Record company boss Paul was so impressed with this dulcet tones he gave him a deal, and he’s now made his first album. Kev says he shocked when Paul offered him a chance to sign onto his New Reality Records, which has artists from Brazil, New York, and Britain. Stunned Kev, of Leicestershire, said, “I got a call to go and quote some bathrooms, I thought fair enough. “I then started work at Paul’s house, and I like to sing while I am working, and he pulled me into the living room one night for a conversation about my singing voice. ”I started telling him that I love music, that I used to be in a band and had written an album—more of a hobby really. ”I was shocked when he said he wanted to hear it. “I sent him the album on the Friday and I thought if I don’t hear from him over the weekend, I can just go back to work for him on the Monday and just carry on fitting his bathrooms.” Kev used to be in a cover band called ‘The Reprise’ in 1990s, covering bands like Depeche Mode, as well as writing his own music. But after two unsuccessful auditions for the popular UK tv shows and in the early 2000s, he decided to give it up. Then Paul said he really liked the album. He wanted to sign Kev up to his label. Kev says, “I carried on working at his house and at the same time finishing my album in the recording studio—it’s overwhelming. Those first tracks are now being released online, weekly up until Christmas. “My wife has been so overwhelmed by it all,” says Kev, “in tears about it. Good tears because she knows it’s my passion.” After the full release of his album, Kev plans to write for other musicians. “I’d love to do it full-time, but, at the minute, I am just going with the flow. It’s my dream. If it ends next week, I tried.” ( the singer in action in the video below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/plumber-landed-record-deal-kev-crane/
"The youngest winner of one of the world’s most prestigious music competitions can’t claim her prize—playing piano at Carnegie Hall—because she’s too young to get the vaccine. Four-year-old Brigitte Xie only started playing piano a year ago in lockdown, but instantly revealed a talent for music. The pint-sized prodigy can read music and play a note-perfect rendition of Beethoven’s Sonatina in F Major—her feet dangling far above the pedals. She won the Elite National Music Competition last December, and then in March this year won first place at the American Protégé International Competition, which wins her an invitation to perform at world-renowned music venue Carnegie Hall in New York City this November where all performers are required to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Pre-schooler Brigitte was forced to pull out – but will be given anther chance at a future concert in 2022. Her mother, Nicole Sun from Ridgefield, Connecticut said, “She doesn’t know much to be honest; I tell her ‘yeah baby you won the prize’ and she was like ‘ok, can we go to Disney store now?’ “I tell her ‘you’re going to perform in front of many people’ and she seemed excited because she likes performing.” A pianist herself, Nicole took the opportunity to introduce her daughter to it while under lockdown last year to keep her entertained. But even though she’s showing a prodigious talent, her mom is not going to push it on her. “As a parent I’m still open to everything, I don’t tell her that she must be a pianist. Whatever she wants to be is fine.” Her daughter began playing piano at age three during the lockdown, and when her mom couldn’t keep up with lessons, she found an online tutor, Felicia Feng Zhang. The little musician “picked up more in six months than most do in years worth of lessons”. She quickly learned to read sheet music and sight read classical pieces, and eventually started attending in-person lessons with Felicia in Greenwich, Connecticut, who urged her to enter competitions. : Her mom didn’t know, at this young age, that Brigitte could follow instructions and play the pieces. “Before the media approached me I thought she was just one of the normal students.” Brigitte passed her Royal College of Music Level 1 exam before her 4th birthday in May with a first class mark of 86. She practices for just 45 minutes a day, and has one half-hour lesson a week, but neither Nicole or dad, Tao Xie, have to nag her, as she’ll wander over herself. : The tinkling tot wants to perform Mozart when she eventually takes the stage— and, had she been able to perform this year, would potentially have been the youngest ever to play on Carnegie Hall.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/4-yo-learned-piano-during-lockdown-wins-elite-competition/
"Out of the ashes of Pompeii, archaeologists recently pulled up a time capsule, though only the bronze hinges remained of what is being described as a “sorceress’ toolkit.” Inside were a collection of around 100 little objects: two mirrors, tiny skulls, scarab beetles, bone-carved objects like buttons, bells, and little fists, decorative elements made of amber, carnelian, and bronze, carved images of men and satyrs, and of course, miniature phallic amulets. All in all it’s everything your average sorceress could need on the job, which archaeologists believe were to tell fortunes, divine pregnancies, conduct fertility rites, and ward off bad luck. “They are objects of everyday life in the female world and are extraordinary because they tell micro-stories, biographies of the inhabitants of the city who tried to escape the eruption” states Pomeii General Director Massimo Osanna. “In the same house, we discovered a room with ten victims, including women and children, and now we are trying to establish kinship relationships, thanks to DNA analysis. Perhaps the precious box belonged to one of these victims.” The box containing the toolkit was found in the Garden House in Regio V, a luxurious villa which also included on the walls, such as the myth of Queen Leda and the Swan, and a fresco of Priapus, the god of fertility. are that the owner of the objects was not of status and could even have been a slave. The lack of gold or precious stones among the trinkets suggests this, as the Pompeiians adored the yellow metal. Speaking with , Osanna theorized the objects belonged a kind of Roman love doctor, but that’s pure speculation. The toolkit will soon be on display in the Palestra Grande on the Pompeii site. It’s fascinating that, even though most of us grew up learning about the city of Pompeii buried under the ash of Vesuvius, major discoveries are still being made there today despite the fact the site is only 163 acres (66 hectares).",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/a-sorceress-toolkit-of-small-fertility-objects-was-uncovered-in-pompeii/
"Dogs can tell the difference between deliberate actions—and mistakes, say scientists. It adds growing evidence to the idea that man’s best friend knows just how we are feeling. First author Dr Britta Schunemann said, “The dogs in our study clearly behaved differently depending on whether the actions of a human experimenter were intentional or unintentional.” Dogs have bonded with people over thousands of years. Obeying every “sit,” “lay down,” and “roll over” command is just one such skill. But whether they understand intentions, or merely respond to outcomes, remains unclear. This is a basic component of Theory of Mind—long regarded as uniquely human. It’s the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others and dogs have it too. They can tell the difference between something done on purpose, or by accident. Dr Schunemann, of Gottingen University, and colleagues tested how they reacted when food rewards were withheld. The researchers found the animals behaved differently depending on whether the actions of the experimenter were intentional or unintentional. It shows dogs can distinguish between actions that were done on purpose, or accidentally. To reach their conclusions, the German team conducted an experiment using the ‘unable vs. unwilling’ paradigm. It works by examining whether test subjects react differently towards a human experimenter. They either intentionally (the unwilling condition) or unintentionally (the unable condition) withhold treats. The experiment was conducted with 51 dogs, each of which was tested under three conditions. Each animal was separated from the human tester by a transparent barrier. It was fed pieces of dog food through a gap. In the ‘unwilling’ condition, the experimenter suddenly withdrew the reward through the gap in the barrier and placed it in front of herself. In the ‘unable-clumsy’ condition, the experimenter brought the reward to the gap and ‘tried’ to pass it through—but then ‘accidentally’ dropped it. In the “unable-blocked” condition, the experimenter again tried to give the dog a reward. But she was unable to because the gap was blocked. In all conditions, the reward remained on the tester’s side of the barrier. Co-author Dr Juliane Brauer, of Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, said, “If dogs are indeed able to ascribe intention-in-action to humans we would expect them to show different reactions in the unwilling condition compared to the two unable conditions. As it turns out, this is exactly what we observed.” The primary behaviour measured by the researchers was the time dogs waited before approaching the reward they were denied. If dogs are able to identify human intentions, they would wait longer before approaching the reward in the unwilling condition, where they were not supposed to have the reward, than in the two unable conditions in which the reward was, in fact, meant for them. Not only did the dogs wait longer in the unwilling condition than in the unable conditions, they were also more likely to sit or lie down—actions often interpreted as appeasing behaviours—and stop wagging their tails. Co-author Dr Hannes Rakoczy, also from Gottingen, said, “This suggests dogs may indeed be able to identify humans’ intention-in-action.” The findings in suggest dogs “may have at least one aspect of Theory of Mind—the capacity to recognize intention-in-action,” said the researchers. Previous studies have found dogs can tell the difference between happy and angry faces. They also process language in a very similar way to humans—picking out emotional tone, intonation, and volume changes that influence meaning. Experts think dogs have gradually evolved over 30,000 years to understand humans. Selective breeding has meant those which could communicate better with their owners were preferred, encouraging the trait to become more pronounced over time.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/max-planck-dogs-intentional-human-behavior/
"Researchers from Switzerland are tapping into an unexpected energy source right under our feet: wooden floorings. Their nanogenerator enables wood to generate energy from our footfalls. They also improved the wood used in the their nanogenerator with a combination of a silicone coating and embedded nanocrystals, resulting in a device that was 80 times more efficient—enough to power LED lightbulbs and small electronics. The team began by transforming wood into a nanogenerator by sandwiching two pieces of functionalized wood between electrodes. Like a shirt-clinging sock fresh out of the dryer, the wood pieces become electrically charged through periodic contacts and separations when stepped on, a phenomenon called the triboelectric effect. The electrons can transfer from one object to another, generating electricity. However, there’s one problem with making a nanogenerator out of wood. “Wood is basically triboneutral,” says senior author Guido Panzarasa, group leader in the professorship of Wood Materials Science. “It means that wood has no real tendency to acquire or to lose electrons.” This limits the material’s ability to generate electricity, “so the challenge is making wood that is able to attract and lose electrons,” Panzarasa explains. To boost wood’s triboelectric properties, the scientists coated one piece of the wood with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a silicone that gains electrons upon contact, while functionalizing the other piece of wood with in-situ-grown nanocrystals called zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8). ZIF-8, a hybrid network of metal ions and organic molecules, has a higher tendency to lose electrons. They also tested different types of wood to determine whether certain species or the direction in which wood is cut could influence its triboelectric properties by serving as a better scaffold for the coating. The researchers found that a triboelectric nanogenerator made with radially cut spruce, a common wood for construction in Europe, performed the best. Together, the treatments boosted the triboelectric nanogenerator’s performance: it generated 80 times more electricity than natural wood. The device’s electricity output was also stable under steady forces for up to 1,500 cycles. The researchers found that a wood floor prototype with a surface area slightly smaller than a piece of paper can produce enough energy to drive household LED lamps and small electronic devices such as calculators. They successfully lit up a lightbulb with the prototype when a human adult walked upon it, turning footsteps into electricity. “Our focus was to demonstrate the possibility of modifying wood with relatively environmentally friendly procedures to make it triboelectric,” says Panzarasa. “Spruce is cheap and available and has favorable mechanical properties. The functionalization approach is quite simple, and it can be scalable on an industrial level. It’s only a matter of engineering.” Besides being efficient, sustainable, and scalable, the newly developed nanogenerator also preserves the features that make the wood useful for interior design, including its mechanical robustness and warm colors. The researchers say that these features might help promote the use of wood nanogenerators as green energy sources in smart buildings. They also say that wood construction could help mitigate climate change by sequestering CO2 from the environment throughout the material’s lifespan. The next step for Panzarasa and his team, whose work has been published in journal, is to further optimize the nanogenerator with chemical coatings that are more eco-friendly and easier to implement. “Even though we initially focused on basic research, eventually, the research that we do should lead to applications in the real world,” says Panzarasa. “The ultimate goal is to understand the potentialities of wood beyond those already known and to enable wood with new properties for future sustainable smart buildings.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wooden-floors-harvest-enough-energy-to-turn-on-a-lightbulb/
"Adorable footage shows the moment a family of ducks checked out of a university library after they had waddled in off the street. The mother and her five ducklings stunned staff and students when they wandered in through an open door at the University of Nottingham’s George Green Library. Emma Halford-Busby, from University of Nottingham Libraries, said, “It had been very hot that week, so we had left our doors open for some extra air movement.” The ducks came in and “walked around our atrium for a while, mom in front and ducklings in a line behind. Mom was totally calm and unflustered.” After they apparently checked out the range of books on the shelves. “You often come across ducks in seemingly odd places around campus, but that was definitely the oddest place I’ve seen them. “It did bring some excitement into an otherwise peaceful evening…” Video footage shows the bird family heading under the security barrier as they eventually made their exit back to their pond. Emma says, “As they walked towards our other entrance, one of our staff gently ushered them through the gates and back outside.” Commenting on social media, one student noted,” That is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.” Another said, perhaps a little enviously,, “They can they just ‘duck’ under the underneath the barriers…” Fowl play to them, we say.

"One innovative company perfectly embodies the ideals of consumers who deserve and are demanding the ‘right to repair’. ‘ constant detective work to see which automotive parts are failing in large numbers on which models has allowed them to grow into a big operation—where they know exactly which parts on your car are likely to break first, why, and how to make them better, giving consumers not only cheaper prices at the garage, but the freedom of DIY. For those old enough to remember being able to open the hood of a car and see parts they could reach with their hands, they’ll know it’s much more difficult nowadays to make repairs on your own. After-market auto parts is a $200+ billion a year sector, and while most manufacturers have to make millions of different parts and get bossed around by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Dorman stays nimble by choosing only the parts likely to break, and selling them at a third of the cost. They’ve gotten so good at this that the parts departments at many dealers stock the Dorman parts instead of OEM parts. The secret is constant market research. By repeatedly plumbing the depths of America’s auto-workforce to learn which parts are going wrong and why, they attain short-term near-monopoly positions in thousands of mini-markets—the brake dust shields for 00-14 GMC models’ wheels for example. From tens of thousands of new product ideas, Dorman will choose several thousand that are in extreme niches and likely to be ignored by OEMs or big after-market producers. It then re-designs the part to fix any flaws, for instance adding a protective coating to a fast corroding part or changing the interface to make it easier to install. In this way they not only please the customer, but their outsourced R&D department—the mechanics that submit ideas for new parts inform them of ones they are replacing frequently, and are perhaps more likely to look at the Dorman catalogue before ordering an OEM part. They back up this innovative business model with a strong marketing presence of how-to guides, a big social media block, and newsletters to ensure they are sowing the seeds for future information/buying opportunities. For example, they do a monthly parts review, explaining which after-market solutions they’ve perfected on original designs. In some cases, like master cylinder or lift-gate motor parts, Dorman explain the OEMs often require you to replace the whole assembly, rather than specific inferior components they’ve identified and improved. When you factor in labor, the cost savings are astronomical.

"The US Department of Agriculture announced this month an end to large-scale old growth timber sales in Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, “returning stability and certainty” to the conservation of 9.3 million acres of the world’s largest temperate old growth rainforest. The USDA will also move to restore the two-decades-old ‘Roadless Rule’ protections at Tongass, which were stripped in 2020 by the Trump administration. In this unique landscape, the Pacific Ocean moisture collides with the towering Coast Mountains on the Canadian border to create the lush greenery and thick old-growth forest that spans 500 miles at the Southern tip of the state. About the size of West Virginia, the land is filled with islands and salmon streams, where granite cliffs drop into deep fjords. “We look forward to meaningful consultation with Tribal governments and Alaska Native corporations, and engaging with local communities, partners, and the State to prioritize management and investments in the region that reflect a holistic approach,” said US Secretary Tom Vilsack. : “This approach will help us chart the path to long-term economic opportunities that are sustainable and reflect Southeast Alaska’s rich cultural heritage and magnificent natural resources,” he added. There were tentative logging plans for three major harvests of more than 15,750 acres on Forest Service land, but the environmental analyses were never completed, so the Biden administration officials said these sales would not take place. USDA’s actions to preserve the temperate rainforest are “critical for carbon sequestration, addressing the climate crisis and maintaining the productivity and health of the region’s fisheries and fishing industry,” said a . “It stores more carbon than any other national forest in the United States.” : The Tongass National Forest has international significance as the largest intact temperate rainforest in the world, representing nearly a third of all such remaining old-growth forests. It holds more biomass per acre than any other rainforest in the world and is home to more than 400 species – including 5 species of salmon that return to spawn in the Tongass each year. Small and micro old growth sales will still be offered to the indigenous community for cultural uses such as totem poles and canoes. :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/usda-halts-old-growth-timber-sales-in-tongass/
"A smile is the key to a thousand doors, but deploying it in every situation without mastery of its use is dangerous, says a new social science study. They say it takes 400 muscles to smile, well scientists at Queen’s University Belfast found that subtle differences in the way in which a person smiled had not-so-subtle impacts on the opinions which the test participants had about the smiler. “Smiling at another person does not always lead to trust and cooperation,” said Dr. Stephanie Carpenter from the University of Michigan, a co-author of the study. “Subtle differences in a smile can have a real impact on whether people trust each other and choose to cooperate. In fact, the way you smile in a good or bad situation can impact whether people trust you.” While playing a set of economic games, such as those that require trust to create value for both players, or which can confer more value for a single person willing to deceive, the subject individual first displayed uncooperative behavior and thus triggered a loss of trust or confidence in their partner. It was then that, depending on the characteristics of the smile made at game’s end by the subject, the participants altered their expectations of how the smiler would behave during the next game. Three different smiles were used, which were labeled as reward, dominance, and affiliation. These three words belittle the emotional reaction they trigger, and a glance at each one invokes strong feelings, and likely memories of seeing such expressions in the past. After untrustworthy or uncooperative behavior, a reward smile—a big ear-to-ear smile like a kid who got the ice cream he was begging for, and a dominance smile, a smirk-y sign of superiority, elicited very little trust, expectations of change in behavior, and positivity when compared with a totally neutral expression, or a look of regret, meaning that sometimes smiles can create even stronger negative feelings than not smiling. However the “affiliation smile,” which seems to have a hint of regret, like the smile a someone might make after consoling a dear friend, the broken relationship and to trust the person who had just done something unfair. “Think about movie villains, for example in James Bond films,” said Dr. Magdalena Rychlowska from Queen’s University, who led the research published in journal. “They often make happy smiles when something bad has happened or is about to happen. This context makes these otherwise happy and normal smiles feel threatening and unpleasant.” She adds, “The findings of this study show the power of subtle facial expressions and the positive consequences that an affiliation smile can have in difficult situations. It also highlights the importance of social context—a happy smile that could be read as a signal of trustworthiness in one setting can, in another setting, be seen as evidence of bad intentions.” Mastery of the smile then, can be an excellent way of getting out of difficult social situations, while the lack thereof can be an excellent way of getting into one.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/scientists-have-determined-that-certain-smiles-damage-trust-while-others-can-repair-it/
"A realtor in Missouri is determined to make her hometown “a city where no one sleeps outside.” For nine years Linda Brown and her husband David organized a nightly drop-in shelter where homeless people in Springfield could eat, shower, do laundry, use a computer, and socialize during bingo games and karaoke—but they wanted to do more. So they transformed an abandoned mobile home property into a village of tiny homes that provides permanent housing to the chronically disabled homeless. They raised $4.75 million and opened Eden Village in 2018, erecting 31 tiny homes that are now occupied by people like Jonathan Fisher. He was battling substance abuse, and had lived on the streets for two years when he met Linda Brown, who changed his life. “In the worst moments of my life, Linda gave me guidance, care, and made me feel like I was still worth something,” Fisher says. He says that Brown took the time to learn about how he became homeless, and then encouraged him as he rebuilt his life. She even offered him a job. Now sober, Fisher works full-time for Brown, doing construction and maintenance on the 31 homes, and helping others experiencing struggles similar to what he went through. The driving philosophy behind Eden Village is the same that fuels the movement: The root causes of a person’s homelessness cannot be thoroughly addressed until his or her immediate housing needs are met. “I watched as my (homeless) friends walked off into the darkness to a hidden, wet, cold camp while we went home to a warm bed,” Linda told the National Association of Realtors, who honored her with their Good Neighbor Award in 2020. “I had to do something,” That was the moment that formed her vision for the tiny-home village that serves as a place where the chronically disabled homeless “can live with dignity and self-worth.” : After drawing sponsorship money from Coldwell Banker, the Greater Springfield Board of Realtors, local banks, churches, and area residents, by February 2019, all 31 tiny homes, which cost about $42,000 each, were occupied. “It takes someone who wants to do something, and then believes they can. I’ve watched Linda Brown live that out,” says Nate Schleuter, who helped launch , but now is the chief visionary officer for Eden Village. “It’s exciting to watch the homeless who thought they’d live the rest of their life on the street now have a home.” Brown’s 13 years of real estate expertise has been essential to the development of the tiny-home community. She learned of a listing for an abandoned 4.2-acre mobile park on Springfield’s east side. The property wouldn’t need to be rezoned for tiny-home trailers, and the infrastructure and utilities were already in place. The tiny homes are rolled in on wheels attached to their steel frames, qualifying them as recreational vehicles. The 400-square-foot individual homes are fully furnished, including dishes and bedding. Residents pay $300 per month, which includes utilities. Most receive government disability checks of $725 per month to cover expenses. They can remain in their home as long as they wish, provided they remain a good neighbor in the community. The village includes a 4,000-square-foot community center where residents can hold cookouts, do laundry, and access a medical office staffed with student nurse volunteers and mental health professionals. Eden Village was even the site of a marriage ceremony for two residents. Plans for additional villages are already underway on donated land. Eden Village 2 will house 24 residents in tiny homes and is close to opening. Then, work will begin on Eden Village 3, which could house up to 80 residents in duplexes. Over the next six years, Brown, who is a realtor for Amax Real Estate, plans to have five villages across Springfield, housing an estimated 200 homeless people. : Fisher says Brown’s devotion helped him emerge from the grip of homelessness. “She helped me to build a better life,” Fisher says. “Even when I was struggling with homelessness and sobriety, she showed me I was valuable and that my potential shouldn’t be wasted. She made me feel like I belonged somewhere.” Other cities are seeking to duplicate Eden Village. One project is underway in Wilmington, N.C., and 34 other communities are making plans.

What do I mean by that? I’m suggesting that you will strengthen your problem-solving abilities by engaging in playful pretending for the sheer fun of it. I’m predicting that you will boost your confidence by dreaming up amusing magical stories in which you endure heroic tests and achieve epic feats. And I’m proposing that you will fine-tune your ability to accomplish practical feats if you regard your robust imagination as crucial to your success. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Virgo singer-songwriter says she’s not religious. On the other hand, she regularly kneels on the ground and announces to whatever great power might be listening, “Thank you for my problems, and I send my love everywhere.” She’s sincere. She regards her sadness and her challenges as being equally important to her happiness and success. The difficulties teach her what she didn’t even realize she needed to know, and make her appreciate the good times more intensely. I suggest you borrow from her approach right now. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Nobel Prize-winning author wrote, “Great feelings bring with them their own universe”—which he said may either be degraded or splendid, selfish or generous. I love that he allowed for the possibility that great feelings could be positive and noble. So many renowned thinkers focus on negative and ignoble states of mind. In accordance with current astrological potentials, Libra, your task is to cultivate feelings that are splendid and generous. These sentiments should exalt you, uplift you, and empower you to spread transformative benevolence to those whose lives you touch. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): “How can you hold on to something that won’t hold still?” asked Scorpio poet . In general, you Scorpios have more talent than every other sign of the zodiac at doing just that: corralling wiggly, slippery things and making them work for you. And I expect this skill will be especially in play for you during the coming weeks. Your grasp on the elusive assets won’t ever be perfect, but it will be sufficiently effective to accomplish small wonders. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Sagittarian is a witty writer with a good imagination and a flair for inventive language. But back in school, he confesses, “Math was always my bad subject. I couldn’t convince my teachers that many of my answers were meant ironically.” You Sagittarians are authorized by the cosmic powers-that-be to borrow your style and attitude from Trillin in the coming weeks. So you shouldn’t be fixated on mathematical precision and fastidious logic; your task is not to be conceptually impeccable and scrupulously sensible. Rather, you have a license to be extra lyrical and lush and rhapsodic and humorous and irrepressible. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): In 2011, an eBay seller produced a 19th-century photo that he said proved Capricorn actor Nicholas Cage is a time-traveling vampire. Although the character in the image did indeed resemble the Oscar-winning star, he rejected the theory, and emphatically declared that he is not a time-traveling vampire. Maybe that all sounds absurd, but I must tell you that you may soon have to deal with people’s equally inaccurate and off-kilter theories about you. My advice: Don’t take it personally. Simply correct others’ misimpressions and rely solely on yourself for definitive ideas about who you are. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): I’ve assembled excerpts of love poems for your inspiration. Why?

Consider using the following riffs as inspiration when you interact with loved ones. 1. “I profess the religion of love; it’s the belief, the faith I keep.” 2. “Holding your hand, I can hear your bones singing into mine and feel the moon as it rolls through you.” 3. “Raw light spills from your eyes, utterly naked, awakening an intoxicating shimmer of adventure.” 4. “I ask you please to speak to me forever.” (Poem fragments are from Ibn ‘Arabi, Al-Saddiq Al-Raddi, Herman Hesse, Sara Eliza Johnson, Alejandra Pizarnik.) PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): A “moon garden” brings joy through flowers and plants that reveal their full beauty after dark. Among the flowers that bloom at night are evening primrose, angel’s trumpet, and Dutchman’s pipe cactus. As for the flowers whose aromas are most potent after the sun sets: night-blooming jasmine, garden heliotrope, and honeysuckle. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you will have resemblances to a moon garden in the near future, Pisces. Be alert for opportunities to glow and grow in the dark. ARIES (March 21-April 19): Author reminds us that as children, we all had the “magical capacity to see the land as an animal does; to experience the sky from the perspective of a flower or a bee; to feel the earth quiver and breathe beneath us; to know a hundred different smells of mud and listen unselfconsciously to the soughing of the trees.” Oh, how I would love you to be able to recover even a fraction of those talents in the coming days. My reading of the current astrological potentials tells me that your chances of doing so are much better than usual. Your ability to connect with the eternal child and wise animal within you is at a peak. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Taurus singer Barbra Streisand has a ‘shopping mall’ built below her large home to display her precious belongings and show them off when friends come over. Among the storefronts are an antique store, doll shop, costume shop, and candy store. The coming weeks would be an excellent time for you to start building a shopping mall beneath your home, too, Taurus. If that’s too expensive or complicated, here are alternatives: 1. Revitalize your appreciation for your treasured possessions. 2. Acquire a new treasured possession or two that will inspire you to love your life even more than you already do. 3. Reacquaint yourself with the spiritual powers that your treasured possessions arouse in you. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): The says there are core similarities between science and Buddhism. Both keep searching for ever-more complete versions of the truth. Both employ firsthand observation and experimentation to do that noble work. If they find new information that contradicts previously held versions of the truth, both are willing to discard them. Now that you Geminis are entering the Deep Questioning Phase of your astrological cycle, I’d love you to make generous use of the Buddhist/Scientific approach. More complete versions of the truth will be available in abundance in the coming weeks—if you’re alert for them. CANCER (June 21-July 22): Cancerian artist (1593–1656) achieved the impossible: She became a supremely skilled and renowned painter in an era when women had virtually no opportunities to become artists. Many aspects of her work distinguished her from other painters. For example, she depicted women as having strong, agile hands and arms. In Artemisia’s world, the power of women’s wrists, forearms, and fingers signifies their ability to put their mark upon the world, to accomplish strenuous practical tasks with grace and flair. If I were going to paint images of you in the coming weeks, I would also portray you as having strong, agile hands and arms. I suspect you’ll have potent agency to get things done—to adeptly manipulate the material world to serve your ideals. (Thoughts about Artemisia’s hands come from art historian Mary D. Garrard.)

"Physicists have discovered a way to trap the world’s coldest plasma in a magnetic bottle, a technological achievement that could advance research into clean energy, space weather, and astrophysics. “To understand how the solar wind interacts with the Earth, or to generate clean energy from nuclear fusion, one has to understand how plasma—a soup of electrons and ions—behaves in a magnetic field,” said Rice Dean of Natural Sciences Tom Killian. Using laser-cooled strontium, Killian and graduate students Grant Gorman and MacKenzie Warrens made a plasma about 1 degree above absolute zero, or approximately -272 degrees Celsius, and trapped it briefly with forces from surrounding magnets. It is the first time an ultracold plasma has been magnetically confined, and Killian, who’s studied ultracold plasmas for more than two decades, said it opens the door for studying plasmas in many settings. “This provides a clean and controllable testbed for studying neutral plasmas in far more complex locations, like the sun’s atmosphere or white dwarf stars,” said Killian, a professor of physics and astronomy. “It’s really helpful to have the plasma so cold and to have these very clean laboratory systems. Starting off with a simple, small, well-controlled, well-understood system allows you to strip away some of the clutter and really isolate the phenomenon you want to see.” That’s important for study co-author Stephen Bradshaw, a Rice astrophysicist who specializes in studying plasma phenomena on the sun. “Throughout the sun’s atomosphere, the (strong) magnetic field has the effect of altering everything relative to what you would expect without a magnetic field, but in very subtle and complicated ways that can really trip you up if you don’t have a really good understanding of it,” said Bradshaw, an associate professor of physics and astronomy. Solar physicists rarely get a clear observation of specific features in the sun’s atmosphere because part of the atmosphere lies between the camera and those features, and unrelated phenomena in the intervening atmosphere obscures what they’d like to observe. “Unfortunately, because of this line-of-sight problem, observational measurements of plasma properties are associated with quite a lot of uncertainty,” Bradshaw said. “But as we improve our understanding of the phenomena, and crucially, use the laboratory results to test and calibrate our numerical models, then hopefully we can reduce the uncertainty in these measurements.” Plasma is one of four fundamental states of matter, but unlike solids, liquids, and gases, plasmas aren’t generally part of everyday life because they tend to occur in very hot places like the sun, a lightning bolt, or candle flame. Like those hot plasmas, Killian’s plasmas are soups of electrons and ions, but they’re made cold by laser-cooling, a technique developed a quarter century ago to trap and slow matter with light. Killian said the quadrupole magnetic setup that was used to trap the plasma is a standard part of the ultracold setup that his lab and others use to make ultracold plasmas. But finding out how to trap plasma with the magnets was a thorny problem because the magnetic field plays havoc with the optical system that physicists use to look at ultracold plasmas. “Our diagnostic is laser-induced fluorescence, where we shine a laser beam onto the ions in our plasma, and if the frequency of the beam is just right, the ions will scatter photons very effectively,” he said. “You can take a picture of them and see where the ions are, and you can even measure their velocity by looking at the Doppler shift, just like using a radar gun to see how fast a car is moving. But the magnetic fields actually shift around the resonant frequencies, and we have to disentangle the shifts in the spectrum that are coming from the magnetic field from the Doppler shifts we’re interested in observing.” That complicates experiments significantly, and to make matters even more complicated, the magnetic fields change dramatically throughout the plasma. “So we have to deal with not just a magnetic field, but a magnetic field that’s varying in space, in a reasonably complicated way, in order to understand the data and figure out what’s happening in the plasma,” Killian said. “We spent a year just trying to figure out what we were seeing once we got the data.” The plasma behavior in the experiments is also made more complex by the magnetic field. Which is precisely why the trapping technique could be so useful. “There is a lot of complexity as our plasma expands across these field lines and starts to feel the forces and get trapped,” Killian said. “This is a really common phenomenon, but it’s very complicated and something we really need to understand.” One example from nature is the solar wind, streams of high-energy plasma from the sun that cause the aurora borealis, or northern lights. When plasma from the solar wind strikes Earth, it interacts with our planet’s magnetic field, and the details of those interactions are still unclear. Another example is fusion energy research, where physicists and engineers hope to recreate the conditions inside the sun to create a vast supply of clean energy. Killian said the quadrupole magnetic setup that he, Gorman, and Warrens used to bottle their ultracold plasmas is similar to designs that fusion energy researchers developed in the 1960s. The plasma for fusion needs to be about 150 million degrees Celsius, and magnetically containing it is a challenge, Bradshaw said, in part because of unanswered questions about how the plasma and magnetic fields interact and influence one another. “One of the major problems is keeping the magnetic field stable enough for long enough to actually contain the reaction,” Bradshaw, who is the corresponding author of a published study about the work in , said. “As soon as there’s a small sort of perturbation in the magnetic field, it grows and ‘pfft,’ the nuclear reaction is ruined. “For it to work well, you have to keep things really, really stable,” he said. “And there again, looking at things in a really nice, pristine laboratory plasma could help us better understand how particles interact with the field.” ( the video about this below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/rice-university-bottling-the-worlds-coldest-plasma/
"The Hyundai driver whose car tumbled over a Florida causeway into the Indian River in the middle of the night has a few Good Samaritans to thank for saving her life. One bystander called 911, while she sprinted across the street to flag down an a Melbourne police officer who happened to be conducting a traffic stop nearby. “Help! There is a person in the water, please!” Officer Peter Dolci III came running and police body camera footage shows the car, which the witness said flipped over 2 or 3 times, half submerged on its side. Dolci jumped into the water and discovered a Good Samaritan crouched in the river partially inside the vehicle holding the unconscious driver’s head above water. When Officer Luke Drummer arrived, they pried out the window so they could pull her out and drag her to land. The unidentified Samaritan could be heard saying she isn’t breathing and urging officers to give her CPR. “He did a great job,” Dolci told reporters. “He kept his cool.” : The driver was soon in stable condition and breathing on her own, after being taken to a hospital.

"Whether you’re from the U.S. and call it a “Beltway” or Europe and call it a “Ring road,” Madrid will be calling it the “green way” soon enough, as the Spanish capital aims to combat their city’s island of heat by encircling themselves with a sea of green. Their urban forest project will involve planting nearly a half million trees on a 46-mile perimeter (75-km) around the city. When the trees have reached maturity, they should absorb around 175,000 tons of CO2 per year. Black pine, beech, Spanish juniper and various oak species can all be found in the arid middle of Spain wherein lies the Spanish capital, and it is these native trees which require little water or specialized soil conditions that will constitute the new forest. : “What we want to do is to improve the air quality in the whole city, to fight the ‘heat island’ effect that is happening inside the city, to absorb the greenhouse emissions generated by the city, and to connect all the existing forest masses that already exist around the city,” Mariano Fuentes told As Madrid’s councilor for the environment and urban development, Fuentes explained that for cities that belch three-quarters of all human-caused CO2, which tend to absorb much more heat and poor air than surrounding countryside, methods for combating climate change and general environmental degradation need to be varied. “It has to be a global strategy,” added Fuentes. “It’s not only about cars, but also a pedestrianization strategy, the creation of environmental corridors in every district… and most of all… to engage citizens in this new green culture, it is essential for every city to face the near future in the best conditions.” : Experts assured reporters that “it’s not a park,” but certainly for nature-loving Madrileños, it will be a place of respite, shade, and bird habitat that will work night and day to absorb excess heat and clean the air of the European mega-city. the video from EuroNews…",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/madrid-to-create-perimeter-forest-around-the-city-to-absorb-heat-and-co2/
"Since the start of the pandemic, there have been tons of stories making the media rounds about crazy-generous restaurant customers leaving behind outrageously large tips to the amazement of stunned and deliriously happy waitstaff. While it’s true that an extra—or even extravagant—monetary tip is always a nice bonus, sometimes a heartfelt show of appreciation can mean a whole lot more. Last Sunday, as waitress Megan King was working a routine shift, she took the order of an elderly woman who was eating alone. King classed their interaction as pleasant, but nothing out of the ordinary. “She came in about halfway through my 17-hour shift, and it was on Sunday, which is always pretty busy,” King told . “About halfway through her meal, it started to slow down so we chatted for a few minutes. Small talk, nothing too deep. She told me she was almost 70… and she just wanted to stop by an old favorite for a bite.” But the note the patron left behind with the $3 tip on her $11 check brought King to tears. “Thank you very much for your kind service,” it read. “This was my first time eating out alone since my husband passed. I was hoping I could get through it.” As she’d eaten her meal, King noticed the woman seemed quiet and contemplative. The waitress’s first instincts made her assume there might have been something wrong with the food, but in hindsight, King wishes she’d been a little more alert to her customer’s cues. “I wish I would’ve taken her quiet as an invitation,” she told Newsweek. “I think that’s what she wanted, looking back… I guess she did, in a way. [She needed] an ear.” King says she was so choked with emotion when she read the note, she had to take a moment to pull herself back together in the ladies’ room. On Tuesday, captioned only with the words “in pain,” King posted a picture of the note and one of her tearful reaction to Twitter. in pain The now-viral tweet has amassed more than 821,000 likes so far and a ton of feedback. “[T]hat’s super sad, but also sweet at the same time,” one viewer commented. “i just wanna give whoever wrote this note a hug.” Some commenters noted that they thought the woman had given King short shrift on the tip—leaving only a dollar—which was not the case. King was quick to dispel the error and the stereotype that the elderly are bad tippers in general. “A lot of our customers are older and living on fixed incomes, so they tip what they can,” King told Newsweek. “They are always welcome, no matter how much or little they tip.” As a rule, tipping at the end of a meal is recognition for good service, but it’s all too easy to lose the importance of human interaction in the passing transaction. King, who has a special place in her heart for the restaurant’s older patrons, hasn’t lost sight of what matters. The word “gratuity” comes from the Latin meaning “gift” or “pleasing, thankful”—and not surprisingly, it’s also the same root word from which we get a measure of “grace.” Not money in the bank, perhaps, but priceless nonetheless.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/waitress-in-tears-after-receiving-thank-you-note-from-widow-eating-alone/

"By putting the recycling costs on the producer rather than the consumer, Maine becomes the first U.S. state to hold companies responsible for the waste they create. In putting what is essentially an import duty on packaging, Maine is telling companies there is a limit to the amount of reliance they can have on Mainers and municipalities to recycle their material. If a company is using less-than eco-friendly packaging, they have to pay a Stewardship Organization (SO) per ton of packaging they bring into the state. The SO then looks at the costs and workload of recycling programs around the state and reimburses them depending on the amount and type of material they are processing. Prior to the law, the only way to raise money for recycling was more taxes. “It’s really designed to help tackle our waste crisis, get us to finally reaching our goal of recycling 50% of our waste which we set back in 1989 but never met,” said Sarah Nichols, Director at the Natural Resources Council of Maine, in an interview with Nichols hypothesizes that companies will do more either to create eco-friendly packaging or to have clear recycling instructions and labels on their products that will ensure Mainers don’t put the wrong thing in the wrong bin. Successful companies are often the nimblest ones; able to adapt to changing market and regulatory conditions, while remaining profitable. Small producers, either those who make less than $2 million gross or who create less than one ton of waste per year, would be exempt from the tax, ensuring Maine’s small business sector isn’t over-burdened with regulatory costs. Nichols said that while Maine was the first U.S. state to pass a law like this, Oregon has a similar one heading to the governor’s desk, and that she is certain they “won’t be the last.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/maine-law-makes-companies-responsible-for-paying-the-recycling-costs-of-their-packaging/

"Zoo keepers made a tortoise a homemade scratching station, and an adorable video shows the creature wiggling while trying it out. Morgan Brem, a Dallas Zoo intern, created the scratching device for Sunny the radiated tortoise. Made from broom heads, it’s perfect for the little animal to itch the impossible-to-reach spots on the top of his shell. Robin Ryan, supervisor of ambassador animal experiences at Dallas Zoo, said: “She made it adjustable to see if our ambassador armadillo would also be interested, but so far, we have only seen Sunny use it. “The base is wood with a turf mat cover for belly scratch opportunity, the frame is PVC, and the brush heads are held on with conduit fittings.” To “maximise scratching abilities”, the top brush was lowered twice for Sunny, who has been at the Dallas Zoo since 1980. Robin said tortoises’ shells are part of their spine and they have nerve endings which run on the top. Ryan explains that: “The name ‘radiated tortoise’ comes from the pattern on Sunny’s shell.

"There’s an old saying that goes, “Good fences make good neighbors.” With so many folks forced to stay at home during the pandemic, some are happy to report that good fences can also make good friends. In Minneapolis, the Olson family lives next door to 99-year-old Mary O’Neill. Although Mary has an adult daughter in the area who visits once a week, with the rest of her relatives scattered, for the most part, the pandemic left the soon-to-be centenarian in seclusion. But as lockdown wore on, Mary managed to forge a special friendship with one of her neighbors—Benjamin Olson, age 2. Over time, Mary watched through the chain-link as Benjamin learned to walk, talk, and eventually run and play. Despite the huge differences in their ages, Benjamin was drawn to his elderly neighbor, delighting in her presence. Between the two, they developed a game they could play over the fence. Ben would pass her a ball and she’d hit it back to him with her cane. While others might remark at the 97-year gap between the two pals, when Ben sees Mary, he simply sees a friend, not a number. “She’s just Mary, or in the past couple of days, he’s been calling her ‘Mimi.’ We’ll be playing inside and he’ll go, ‘Mimi? Mimi?’ and we’ll go outside and look for [her],” Benjamin’s mom Sarah Olson told . “She’ll call out, ‘Hey Benjamin!’ when she sees him, and it’s just been so cute to watch it.” Although the pair’s special affinity definitely scores high on the cuteness factor, Sarah and Mary’s adult daughter believe the relationship has been a lifeline that’s kept the elderly woman going through the long period of isolation. As pandemic restrictions have lifted, Mary and Benjamin’s bond continues to blossom on both sides of the fence—only now, the gates can be opened. Benjamin joins Mary on her back steps to play games, blow bubbles, and enjoy the activities that bring joy to both the young and the young at heart. “Friendship can just happen so many different ways,” Sarah told CBS. “I’m just really happy they were able to form this [one]—quarantine or not, pandemic or not. I’m happy…because it means a lot to her and it means a lot to him too.” In August, when Mary celebrates her 100th birthday, it’s a good bet Benjamin and his family will be there to help her blow out the candles and make a wish. But we’re guessing the one thing she won’t be wishing for is a best friend. Benjamin’s already got one that covered.

"During the next few weeks, look up and you can expect to see more than your average number of bright and shimmery shooting stars lighting up the night sky. The Perseids “are considered the best meteor shower of the year,” according to . This year’s show began on July 17 and will last until August 26. The peak will be on the night of August 11, running into the early hours of August 12. That’s when the rate of shooting stars will be at its highest, with about 50 meteors per hour. The extra good news? The moon will be only 13% illuminated on August 11, so if you have clear skies you’ll have an excellent view of all those shooting stars. You can be anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere to enjoy this show of speed and light. Fine summer weather should make for comfortable viewing too.

According to , “Meteors occur when Earth rushes through a stream of dust and debris left behind by a passing comet (the Swift-Tuttle comet, in the case of the Perseids). When the bits strike Earth’s upper atmosphere, friction with the air causes each particle to heat and burn up. We see the result as a meteor.” P.S.

"The urge for most of us is to throw something away—even if it means we have to buy a new one for more money—as it’s often easier than finding a store that will fix it, taking it there, then going out later and picking it back up, all with the chance that it might break again in the future. But the residents of one Glasgow neighorhood are taking on that important responsibility.

But it’s the right thing to do for the planet in a sense, as old electronics are contributing enormously to non-degradable landfill waste. Furthermore, it’s not only the burden of transporting, storing, and tossing e-waste in a landfill, but the emissions that come from producing its replacement. Computers, phones, and tablets for example need microchips that rely on lithium to produce, which is a rare earth mineral that is costly—both in terms of dollars and CO2 emissions—to mine.

"Surgeons at Duke University successfully implanted a new-generation artificial heart in a man with heart failure—a first for any hospital in North America. The artificial heart was developed by a French company, CARMAT and has been approved for use and sale in Europe. Last year, the company received U.S. FDA approval to begin studies and enroll 10 patients with end-stage biventricular heart failure—people who are suffering on the waiting list for a heart donor—and offer a life-saving bridge before transplant. “We are encouraged that our patient is doing so well after the procedure Monday,” said Dr. Carmelo Milano, a transplant surgeon and the principal investigator of the device study at Duke. “As we evaluate this device, we are both excited and hopeful that patients who otherwise have few to no options could have a lifeline.” : The North Carolina patient, Matthew Moore, is just 39-years-old and was referred to Duke in June after a sudden, unexpected diagnosis of heart failure. Moore and his wife, Rachel, recently adopted their two-year-old foster son, Marshall, and arrived at Duke expecting only to undergo heart bypass surgery. As Moore’s condition quickly deteriorated, however, traditional options, including transplant, became too risky. Meanwhile, Duke was among just three transplant centers in the United States selected to join the device study, and the procedure team received specialized training to prepare for the implant surgery. Matthew’s wife, a nurse, said, “Both Matthew and I are so grateful that we’ve been provided an opportunity to participate in something that has the potential to have an impact on so many lives. We are just taking it day-by-day and hope everything continues to progress well.” The artificial heart device called the ‘Aeson’, is an implantable prosthetic that includes biological valves derived from bovine tissue and operates on an external power supply. : If the device receives FDA approval, it would provide hope for transplant patients whose hearts require assistance to pump blood through both chambers. Current technology—notably a left-ventricular assist device (LVAD)—supports just one chamber. “Because of the shortages of donor hearts, many patients die while waiting for a heart transplant,” said Schroder, a transplant surgeon who led the implant procedure. “We are hopeful for new options to help these patients, many like Mr. Moore who have devastating disease and cannot otherwise be considered for a transplant.” a CBS report… :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/first-totally-artificial-heart-implanted-at-duke/
"A woman left blind for 15 years has finally regained her sight after a life-changing operation. Doctors believed 59-year-old Connie had glaucoma when she rapidly began to lose her eyesight over a decade ago. But then an ophthalmologist diagnosed cataracts in 2018—one of the most common and treatable adult vision issues. Connie, who lives in Colorado, began noticing halos and prisms on lights while driving in 2003 and went to a doctor who told her she had glaucoma. Three weeks later she lost even more sight and peripheral vision. Doctors believed her vision was inoperable. She went blind. Determined not to let her condition stop her, Connie continued doing things she had loved before—such as ice skating, kayaking, camping, and attending sporting events and concerts. “I was so happy to be in the nosebleeds screaming my lungs out and not seeing anything,” she said. “I just lived life as much as I possibly could the way I did before I lost my sight.” Still, she found some things difficult to adjust to. “I wasn’t really sure to how to use a cane and I would keep walking into bushes,” she said. “I had to have somebody with me when I cooked to make sure the food looked okay. I couldn’t vacuum and had to sweep in a pattern.” Then, three years ago, she got the surgery that changed everything about her life. On November 12th, her right eye was operated on. “When they took my patch off the next day the first thing I saw was the nurse’s eyebrow, eyelashes, and pupil and I started crying,” Connie said. “She had me read an eye chart and the first line I read was 20/20. “I had the second eye done and right after Thanksgiving, I was seeing 20/20 out of both eyes.” Connie’s guide dog Talulah Mae now acts as a regular, much loved dog. He also has a job as a unit clerk with UCHealth. She has been able to see her eldest grandchild for the first time since she was an infant, and her other eight grandkids for the first time ever. “The eldest doesn’t look anything like she looked when she was three weeks old,” Connie joked. Then there’s the unfolding beauties of nature to see and behold once again. “I got to watch all the flowers bud and the trees grow leaves,” she said, delighted. “People think it’s tedious to watch grass grow, but when you haven’t seen a blade of grass in years, you watch the grass grow.” Of seeing her husband once again?

"Off the pristine waters of Alaska, there is a harvest of an almost magical fish that everyone loves, but that maybe doesn’t get the recognition it deserves. For those who believe their dietary choices should account for the impact on climate, the choice is clear, and it isn’t fake meat, but rather Wild Alaskan pollock which has the lowest carbon footprint of any major protein source in the world. The finding, based on a life-cycle assessment (LCA) by the leading sustainability consultancy firm Quantis, is staggering, because when we say major, we mean Wild Alaskan pollock is the world’s largest sustainable wild-caught fishery, and the Association of Genuine Alaskan Pollock Producers (GAPP) produce more wild caught fish for consumption than any other single fishery in the world at 3.3 billion pounds per year. It is the most consumed whitefish in Europe, and the third most consumed fish in the U.S. Staggeringly, pollock from Alaska provides for the entire world’s supply of McDonald’s filet-of-fish sandwiches, as well as the bulk supply of beloved European processed fish products like fish fingers in England, schlemmer-filets in Germany, and kibling in the Netherlands. Furthermore, pollock is the number-one source for surimi, or imitation crab, in Asia and most of the world’s sushi and hotpot restaurants, having cornered the market for products like kamabuko—fish balls for traditional Chinese hotpot—and the California roll. Astonishingly all this supply and demand, all 3.3 billion pounds of it, can be achieved annually with 15% of the total stock of fish. “It schools in volumes that are really unmatched in the world, in any other ocean,” says GAPP CEO Craig Morris. “It schools in what we call very clean biomass. There’s very little bycatch—far less than 1% of what we catch is not what we’re fishing for.” “It’s a fishery that learned from the challenges some of the other fisheries around the world faced. When we started fishing for Alaska pollock 40 years ago, we had to be more efficient than other fisheries because [it] doesn’t school off major population centers.” For GAPP, their control over this magnificent fish comes with pride, and the sense of responsibility normally reserved for National Park Rangers. “We look at this as a fishery that we want to hand down to the generations to come,” said Bob Desutel who sits on the board of directors for GAPP. “We’re quite proud of what we’ve done here, and validated it here with this life-cycle assessment.” The Quantis LCA, which took account of every measurable speck of energy used to produce a frozen piece of pollock, found that all the aforementioned staples can be provided to the world for around 3.7 kg of CO2 or equivalents per kg of pollock, which is substantially-less than any terrestrial protein source, , and from making the Impossible Burger or other fake meats. Propulsion is the primary driver of carbon in the fishery, Bob admitted to but the wild-caught element means that no carbon is produced to create food as would be the case in traditional aquaculture. Furthermore, their substantial reliance on Alaskans for the post-catch segment of the supply chain means that very little carbon is generated through transportation or shipping jobs over seas. Indeed that over 26,000 Alaskans are employed in the seafood industry, with an average of one-third of all work, both catching and processing, done on pollock. “In Alaska, all that really leaves are boneless fillets, boneless surimi and we turn basically everything else into fishmeal and oil,” said Morris. “And those two are processed in Alaska, so basically there’s zero waste. Every pound that leaves Alaska is in a useable form.” “My family comes from Massachusetts and they lived off of what everyone thought was the inexhaustible Atlantic cod resource, and they did not have the coordinated approach that we enjoy in Alaska,” said Morris. “The oceans are something that need a science-based approach to ensure that populations remain at stable levels for generations to come.” And GAPP helps achieve this goal year in year out with the help of the Alaska Fisheries Council, the Dep. of Commerce, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to ensure the health of the fish stocks continue, and that only adult fish are the ones being targeted. In order to further reduce emissions, GAPP and the agencies above use solar-powered sailing drones equipped with sonar that crisscross the waters for as long as it takes until every inch of habitat is surveyed, and the number of fish schooling at about 500-1000 grams weight are counted, thereby setting the catch for the coming year. “For those concerned about the impacts their dietary choices have on climate change, there is a protein that’s right there in front of you, that’s really unmatched in its carbon store,” says Morris. “We wanted to make sure since we’re the largest sustainable wild-caught fishery in the world that our partners looking to make sustainability commitments, it doesn’t matter if that’s an Aldi, a Costco, or a Walmart, we wanted them to know that by marketing our product they’re doing a lot for the environment.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/this-fish-has-the-lowest-carbon-footprint-of-any-protein-in-the-world/
"When a pet goes missing, owners frantically search every Lost & Found website, bombard social media with pleas for help, and post rewards in hopes their fur baby will find its way home. Stories with happy endings are always the best ones—but this tale has a twist. Brayden Morton’s Shar-Pei Darla didn’t just disappear, she was dognapped outside his home in Cranston, British Colombia. Her abductors loaded her into a pickup truck and drove off. Morton immediately posted word of the incident to social media. It was shared more than 30,000 times. A $5,000 reward offer followed. Lots of tips poured in but when Morton got a call from a woman who sounded clearly distraught—he could hear her crying in the background—he knew he’d found the dognapper. Instead of lashing out, he comforted and reassured the woman instead. They arranged to meet at the parking lot of a local mall. The woman, still in tears, gave Darla back to Morton and apologized. She hadn’t acted alone, but she was truly remorseful for her role in the crime. Looking at her, Morton had an epiphany. He realized she was a drug user—she admitted the whole plot was a means to get money to buy drugs—and the reason Morton knew was that he’d once been an addict himself. Clean and sober since May of 2015, Morton’s personal journey back from addiction began at the Top of the World Ranch Treatment Center. After successfully completing the program there, Morton took a volunteer staff position. Eventually, he went on to become an intervention counselor working in the field. (These days, he runs Find the Right Rehab, a company whose goal is to pair addicts with facilities that will afford them the best possible treatment outcomes.) Morton had the reward money with him when he went to collect Darla, but rather than hand it over to the woman, Morton gave her what might turn out to be a life-changing choice instead: If she was willing to go into rehab treatment, he’d pay for it. They’ve been talking it over since that day, and he’s waiting to hear back on what she’s decided. Even knowing from his own experience that an addict will quit only when he or she is truly ready, Morton remains hopeful she’ll take him up on the offer. : But there’s more to the story. While Morton was searching for Darla, a tipster had given him information on another possible suspect. Morton was able to track the man down but learned he wasn’t involved in the dognapping. He was, however, down on his luck and had no place to live. As an act of kindness, Morton paid for a week’s stay at a hotel. From there, thanks to social media, the good deed snowballed. Once they learned of his generosity, not only did Morton’s Facebook cronies pick up the tab for another week’s rent, they found the man a job. For a tale that started out so badly, this one continues to unfold in unexpected and heartening directions. For Morton, being reunited with his beloved dog is truly a blessing, but it’s not the only one he’s taken away from the experience. The road to recovery is long and hard, and without a safety net, homelessness can happen to almost anyone, sober or not. Having the ability to connect with people who are still struggling as he once did and being able to make a difference in their lives has given Morton a unique perspective that’s made him truly thankful. “I would say honestly, more than anything… it was exactly what I needed in my life at that point in time. Those people helped me immensely. [They] really warmed my heart and humbled me,” Morton told the . “I’m just as grateful for those two relationships that I made in this whole ordeal and I’m happy that I was able to meet [them].”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/brayden-morton-offers-to-pay-rehab-for-person-who-stole-his-dog/
"Foraging is a great way to get out into nature, stretch your legs, learn where your food comes from, and save a bit of dollar on groceries. Autumn is one of the only times a year where everywhere you look there’s something you can eat. Orchards are flush with fruit, bushes spring to life with berries, mushrooms emerge from the forests, while on the coasts, bivalves are at their most plentiful. Foraging is fun, but it should always be done with care to avoid both poison and the law, so there’s sort of an unwritten “Forager’s Code” worth following: , and the most numerous are the sweet crabapple, southern crabapple, and Oregon or pacific crabapple. Rich in the setting agent pectin, and often more sour than sweet, crabapples are perfect accompaniments to other fruit in jams and preserves. Having enjoyed roses in spring and summer, autumn yields the famous rosehip, , but also fine to eat as they are found, plump and red from September to October in hedgerows, gardens, and public parks. They are rich in vitamin C, A, D, and E, and can also be used in cosmetics and grooming products. Just be sure to eat around or sieve out the seeds, as the hairs around them are  an irritant. Blackberries, really there’s not much to be said. They grow profusely and can produce waterfalls of berries in late-summer early autumn. They have nasty thorns so maybe think about wearing thick gloves when harvesting this one? Perfect for roasting on an open fire, chestnuts fall from their trees encased in large green balls of perilous spikes. They are sweet, and able to be roasted or even boiled in red wine, but there are a few things to note beforehand. First, squirrels adore them, and so you must act fast to collect your share. Second, the easiest way to collect them is to stomp on the sea-urchin like casing with a leather shoe, or something that can be penetrated by a small woody needle, and pick them out carefully. Lastly, you’ll need to store them in the freezer if you want them to last all the way to Christmas, so you’ll need to cut a deep slit into the long side of the chestnut , (you could use a knife too). If you feel like putting the effort in to crack open enough acorns to spoon out the nut material inside, soaking out the tannins and grinding them into powder, you will be rewarded with a super nutrient-dense, stodgy flour that Native Americans used to make bread and even a kind of cake, with a taste a little bit like peanut butter (or so I’ve heard). The bounty of the sea, that is to say, mollusks and bivalves, While foraging mussels, cockles, clams, and oysters on wild sections of coastline, or digging for them in mudflats is perhaps more ideally a winter activity, one can start in November. Mussels should be picked only from fine clear waters at low tide, in areas where the tide doesn’t bring with it too much plastic and debris. They should be left in a bucket of saltwater overnight to clear out the grit. Flat sandy beaches can contain cockles, small-shelled bivalves that grow in clumps. Look for cockle shells on the surface then rake across very lightly and shallow. Like mussels, leave them in the bucket overnight. There are more than fifty different varieties of chanterelle, but all will radiate a luxurious perfume of citrus and apricot. Even though there may be some other mushrooms that look like the golden forest-lighthouse that is the chanterelle, they won’t have that wonderful scent. where there’s no sun whatsoever, and where water will remain in the soil longer than usual. These mushrooms are one of the “Foolproof Four” forageable mushrooms, as they are and have few dangerous twins. Shaggy manes develop black gills that exude an ink-like substance, while their stems are hollow and fibrous. Otherwise a Google image search would do you well for finding them. The mushroom will start to degrade soon, and must ideally be cooked before the day is done. A delicate woody taste means that anything strong will overpower the mushrooms completely. Boletes mushrooms are different from others mostly by the lack of “gills” on the underside of their caps, replaced instead by what looks like sea or bath sponge. The king boletes or porcini is the king of the mushrooms, and, without drowning this listicle in detail, they must be processed—pickled, frozen, or dried with a proper dehydrator. They are wonderfully delicious, and should be looked for around . In the mountains is the best place to look, as the forest, along with reaching the right temperatures only a few hours per day-night cycle, is also easiest to reach by other mushroom hunters… Having hunted porcini in the mountains of Italy, what kind of luck it is to find around 14 kilograms of them. The people I told simply could not believe it. I didn’t have the heart to tell them that I had to throw almost all of them away, because they turned into maggot hotels within 12 hours of leaving the woods; to this day it is one of my greatest shames, but I did not understand the speed at which one must move having found them.

"Unveiled after years of work, an energy startup in Massachusetts is claiming that in a few years they can produce, at scale, “the battery you need to fully retire coal and natural gas plants.” Hoping to solve the key challenge with renewable energy—that of storage—Form Energy’s new battery technology, which they’re calling the “Holy Grail,” ditches lithium for one of the most abundant minerals on Earth: iron. Many battery startups are looking to create a battery system that can reliably store the energy generated when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing for those periods of stillness and darkness when no energy can be created. A deep-dive into Form Energy’s inner-workings by the revealed this gem of a quote, that there is a “Cambrian Explosion” going on in the sector of batteries and energy storage. GNN has reported on this story every step of the way—analyzing new tech from , to , to that lift and drop enormous metal weights. the chemical reaction that creates rust, i.e. iron and oxygen, to store energy in a kind of technology known as stage transition, which harvests the energy given off by matter when it’s stressed or changes form, for example or when a giant weight is lowered, held, and dropped again. Understanding these technologies without being an expert in thermodynamics or chemistry simply involves accepting the fact that since matter is energy, energy can be stored and released in ordinary elements as they change form. “Our first commercial product using our iron-air technology is optimized to store electricity for 100 hours at system costs competitive with legacy power plants,” write Form on their website. “This product is our first step to tackling the biggest barrier to deep decarbonization: making renewable energy available when and where it’s needed, even during multiple days of extreme weather, grid outages, or periods of low renewable generation.” “We’ve completed the science,” Form Energy’s President and COO Ted Wiley, “what’s left to do is scale up from lab-scale prototypes to grid-scale power plants.” Wiley from their location in Sommerville, Massachusetts added that “the modules will be one-tenth the cost of any technology available today for grid energy storage.” Inside the battery cells, thousands of tiny pieces of iron are exposed to oxygen and rust, but when the oxygen is removed, the iron-oxide goes back to iron. By controlling this process, the battery is charged and discharged. According to , Form are planning to have their first 1 MW pilot project installed at the Great River Energy power plant in Minnesota by 2023. Behind this relatively unknown firm are major investors like the Italian oil giant Eni, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Microsoft founder Bill Gates’ subsidiary Breakthrough Energy, and iron giant ArcelorMittal, who just committed $200 million in a series D funding round, hoping to acquire non-exclusive supply rights of iron for the company’s batteries. There are many other wonderful ideas of how to bring renewable energy storage to world markets, but not all of them will survive or attract the funding necessary to see their dreams realized. However the free market, by selecting one firm’s goods and services over another’s, naturally moves the talented labor on to other sectors where it can be better utilized, meaning that as soon as a small pool of battery firms attract most of the investment money, hundreds of innovative energy nerds will be unleashed on other substantial problems in the society.

"Nearly six in 10 American kids admit to stealing one of their parent’s old outfits to wear to school, according to a new poll. A survey of 1,000 kids ages 5-18, and their parents, reveals that nostalgia for the fashion of their parents’ era is strong—with three in four kids saying they think their parents’ sense of style as a teenager was actually “cool.” Kids aren’t just longing for styles of the past, but implementing them into their own wardrobes, with 63% of kids saying that they love retro fashion and find inspiration from the past for their daily school outfits. And 67% said they would take “mom jeans” over skinny jeans any day. Parents have noticed this “retro and reimagined” phenomenon, too. Four in five parents polled say they often see their kids wearing an outfit similar to one they would have worn when they were in school. This back-to-school season, retro styles, DIY self-expression, and personalization are emerging as key trends, and 99% of parents say it’s at least somewhat important to involve their kids in purchasing decisions when it comes to back to school shopping. More than half (51%) also think their child’s generation actually has a better fashion sense than their own. Yet, the survey, conducted by OnePoll on behalf of , found that it’s not just retro styles that are trending this back-to-school season. A second phenomenon revealed by the poll shows that kids see style as a way to express their confidence. Ninety percent think being able to express their personal style helps them feel more productive at school, and nearly half of kids (48%) think a cool or fashionable outfit is essential to their success at school. More importantly, wearing new clothes brings joy to most kids (79%) and helps 57% feel more confident. Additionally, ninety percent of kids said it is important for them to define their unique personal style to set them apart from their peers. Another nine in ten feel that how they dress is an expression of their personal brand, sparking the “glue guns and glitter bombs” trend toward customization and personalization. Seventy percent (70%) of kids say they add personal touches to articles of clothing to make them feel more distinctively special. And outfits make an impression; 41% of kids polled said they’re likely to notice other kids’ outfits at school. Kids also find fashion inspiration from social media (70%), their friends (61%), or movies/TV shows (51%).

"With retailers and restaurants recently uniting to purge their inventory of dangerous “forever chemicals,” consumers can feel a bit better about supporting some of their favorite companies. Made up of 23 brands totaling almost 84,000 physical stores and $570 billion in annual sales—the new alliance is uniting against a class of chemical contaminants variously called PFAS, PFOA, PFOS, or polyfluoroalkyl substances. The diversity of the retailers, from Chipotle to Home Depot, from REI to TJ Maxx, reflects the true nature of the threat. PFAS come from a wide-variety of products, but have no known degradative pathway in nature, giving them the moniker “forever chemicals.” They are found in the coatings inside popcorn bags, on water-proof raincoats, and on linings for non-stick Teflon pans. They are also injected via spray as industrial fire-fighting foam and stain protectors for furniture and outdoor equipment, and are found baked into industrial carpet fibers. Now, they are being found in the water supply for as many as 16.5 million Americans. Recent legislative and corporate governance strategies have seen major reductions in the use of PFAS in some places. For example on July 15, Maine became the PFAS outright, except where it is currently unavoidable, like in critical hospital and medical supplies. “I am proud to see Maine taking action that will change the conversation on how PFAS are regulated, not only addressing the entire class, but creating the requirement to avoid these persistent and toxic chemicals wherever possible,” stated Patrick MacRoy, deputy director of But the benefit to be gained from a in their packaging is that their products end up all over the country and the world, and so can protect people from their harmful effects without relying on the support of a localized government agency. The same goes for Target, Amazon, 7-Eleven, Food Lion, , Panera Bread, Lowes, and others. is an organization that provides excellent oversight on the state of contaminants and harmful chemicals and the products that usually contain them, the scientific work that identified them, and government ordnances banning them. They say that even though it’s likely every human in the U.S. has PFAS in their body, there are steps everyone can take to minimize their risk. One method is to stay away from takeout food containers, popcorn bags, or packaged food. They also of name-brand packaging that is certified as PFAS-free. MadeSafe, in everyday household cleaning and hygiene products, will tell you which ones tend to contain PFAS. Avoid Teflon or other non-stick coatings on pans, don’t use them if you’ve left them on too high a heat for too long, and if the non-stick coating isn’t so non-stick anymore, get rid of the pan. An important detail has emerged in the battle to prevent chemicals in packing products and drinking water on July 21st. The House voted to pass a PFAS “Action Act.” , if passed through the Senate, would give the EPA one year to designate PFOS and PFOA as harmful chemicals, but five years to determine whether to designate PFAS as a harmful substance and harmful air pollutant. In the same vein, a national drinking water standard for these chemicals, meaning how much contamination is legally allowed, is to be established over a period of two years. The bill suggests products should have a ‘containing PFAS’ label, but that such a label should be voluntary. It may be a slow-moving governmental action for now, but we can be proud of the 23 American brands, as well as states like Maine, which aren’t waiting around to get rid of a ‘forever’ toxic chemical.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/this-state-and-23-huge-brands-ban-the-presence-of-pfas-in-their-supply-chains/
"Cameras attached to stop lights and other posts on bridges in Seoul aren’t there to tell if you’re speeding; they’re doing a much more important job—a lifesaving job. Using artificial intelligence, programmers at the Seoul Institute of Technology are building a system of recognizing body movements and other cues to help identify whether someone is contemplating ending their own life. If the system thinks there’s a risk, it will immediately alert local rescue teams. Suicide is a major problem in South Korea, and the rates there are higher than in other well-developed countries. Furthermore, it can be extremely difficult for even trained surveillance teams to deduce whether a person is simply being pensive while enjoying the view from one of Seoul’s 27 bridges. “We believe the new CCTV will enable our crews to detect the cases a bit faster and help us head to a call more promptly,” Kim Hyeong-gil, who is in charge of the Yeouido Water Rescue Brigade, told Critically important is that the system learns by itself from experience, analyzing in every detail what an at-risk person is doing, and then cataloguing the actions depending on whether it was confirmed to be an attempted suicide or not. The programmers are looking to pilot the system with the Seoul Fire and Rescue this October.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/seoul-is-using-ai-to-prevent-suicide-attempts-on-bridges/
"A world-first, pain-free diabetes test could soon be in the hands of consumers following $6.3 million in funding to establish the first manufacturing facility for the device. Funded by the Australian Government’s Modern Manufacturing Initiative, the world-class facility will help transition two decades of lab research to retail shelves to benefit more than 460 million people living with diabetes globally. University of Newcastle physicist and research leader, Professor Paul Dastoor said the first devices are due to roll off the production line by 2023. For patients afflicted with diabetes, who have up till now had to finger prick multiple times a day in order to monitor their glucose levels, this grant could not have come at a more appropriate time. The saliva test makes painful finger-prick testing for type 1 and type 2 diabetes obsolete, representing the first major innovation since the blood glucose test was developed in the 1960s. Professor Dastoor attributes this, in part, to inspiration from his wife, who as a primary school teacher helped young children in her care to monitor their blood glucose levels. “It’s a heartbreaking scenario when the lunch bell rings and everyone runs to the playground, bar an unfortunate few who stay back to surrender their finger for blood testing at every meal time,” Professor Dastoor said. “Our vision was to create a world where no one needs to bleed in order to eat.” With saliva glucose concentrations 100 times lower than in blood, this was easier said than done. “One of our key challenges was the sheer unavailability of glucose in saliva. It exists in minute concentrations, so you need to develop an incredibly powerful platform to detect it. Saliva also contains a plethora of other substances, so you’ve then got to tune out a lot of ‘noise’ to ensure results are accurate,” Professor Dastoor said. Professor Dastoor said the sensor, similar in size to a stick of chewing gum and considerably thinner, was incredibly powerful, detecting substances that exist in saliva in minute concentrations. “With this highly sensitive platform, we can now detect glucose at the levels found in saliva, for the first time,” he explained. Coated with a natural enzyme—Glucose Oxidase—the biosensor interacts with saliva, producing a reaction that generates an electrical current. This current can be detected and measured to reveal highly accurate glucose levels which could be delivered via a smartphone app and the data stored in the cloud. Professor Dastoor said the sensor could be developed for application across 130 indications including tumour markers, hormones, and allergens. “The biosensor is a ‘platform technology’, which means it will be widely applicable to detect a variety of substances that identify a range of diseases. We’re already looking for the substances that identify cancer, hormones and allergies,” he explained. The sensor could also help with new diagnostic tests urgently needed to help eradicate COVID-19. (His team are partnering with the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University to help develop the sensor platform as a non-invasive COVID test.) “The Wyss Institute have developed a clever antifouling coating that can be incorporated into the biosensor platform, offering a new diagnostic tool for COVID-19 that can be printed onto plastic strips at massive scale.” “To see the biosensor on shelves, changing lives will be immensely satisfying, it’s why we do the work we do,” Professor Dastoor said of this next step for his team’s breakthrough technology.

"Whether it’s seeing a kid need only a few seconds to learn on the piano, experiencing getting wiped out by a much better player in a pickup basketball game, or witnessing someone’s encyclopedic memory while they rattle off statistics about geography, humans exhibit natural talents every day. Now, a study seeking the origin of “natural talent” in dogs has been published in It found that just as in humans, some particular pooches display more innate talent than others. This story has a lot to do with border collies, a dog species which the authors of the study note was bred for herding sheep and therefore had to be extra-cognizant of their owners’ calls, instructions, and whistles. The American Kennel Club on a border collie named Chaser, who had 1,022 toys and knew the individual names of every one, while reported on one named Rico who knew the names of 200 toys and could very quickly retrieve those for which he had no name by using exclusion learning and inference at about the level of a 3-year-old human. Locating 34 dog owners across the globe using social media, Claudia Fugazza of Eötvös Loránd University wanted to see if they could attach specific names to all the toys they played with, and be able to recognize and respond to those names immediately. Of those 34 dogs, only one border collie succeeded, a young female named Olivia, who couldn’t entirely complete the trial due to health complications. “[W]e decided to set up a study in which both puppies and adult naïve dogs are systematically and intensively trained for learning at least two object names over a 3-month period, and we used a strictly controlled testing method to assess the dogs’ learning outcome every month from the start of the training,” wrote Fugazza in her . Every month a scientist would visit the dog’s house and test to see if they could retrieve an object based on the names they’d been practicing. If they succeeded, another name would be added. Perhaps the surprising thing is that of the 34 dogs, 19 were border collies, and 18 of them . The hypothesis was that some dogs with certain neurological plasticity owing to either early-life training or breed-activity would have better abilities. However, the dogs learned the names of toys “irrespectively of the age of the subjects and despite intensive training,” the researchers wrote, concluding by saying that “while a few rare individuals can rapidly master multiple object names, we suggest that the capacity to learn object-names in dogs shows analogies with exceptional performance (talent) in humans.” It seems that it’s just as hard to find out why Mozart was Mozart as it is to find out why Chaser the border collie was Chaser the border collie.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/finding-talent-in-dogs-is-as-difficult-as-in-humans/
"The universe offers a myriad of opportunities for random acts of kindness. When such a chance falls in our path, some choose to ignore it and keep on walking, while others rise to the occasion with grace and kindness. Case in point: When Nova Scotia native Matthew Van De Riet unexpectedly found himself at the scene of an auto wreck on a lonely patch of highway, without hesitation, he stepped in to help. Van De Riet was first alerted to the situation when he noticed a very distressed-looking dog standing by the side of the road. Kipper, a 10-year-old Basset Hound, and her canine companion Merlin, a 2-year-old shepherd, had been thrown from their owners’ vehicle by the impact of the crash. After quickly securing the dogs, Van De Riet turned his attentions to the human passengers in the badly damaged vehicle. Though the car was flipped on its roof, both the driver and his girlfriend survived the accident. As Van De Riet tended to them with his first-aid kit, he reached out to another passerby to call for emergency intervention. The medical personnel who arrived soon after determined the female passenger’s injuries, though not life-threatening, warranted her being airlifted to a nearby hospital for care. Rather than leaving the driver and the dogs stranded, Van De Riet transferred the couple’s belongings and all their dog gear into his truck and drove the young man to the Halifax hospital where his girlfriend was being treated. But for Van De Riet, the day’s random acts of kindness were far from finished. With their owners new to the area and having no family close by, Van De Riet was left with the logistical problem of what to do with Kipper and Merlin. Again, without hesitation, he offered to keep the dogs until the couple was able to pick them up. “I figured the least I could do was take those dogs home with me,” told . “I knew the pups were shaken up—and I know if somebody was in an accident and their loved one is hurt, the last thing they need to worry about is their dogs.” Although both pooches appeared to be mostly okay, just to be on the safe side, Van De Riet brought them to a local animal hospital for evaluation. Following a checkup (donated free of charge due to the circumstances), the doggy duo was cleared to go and given pain medication to deal with any lingering effects of the accident. After the vet visit, Van De Riet brought Merlin and Kipper home and let them get acquainted with his two miniature Doberman housemates. A long day filled with unforeseen events and random acts of kindness was followed by a quiet night of trust, safety, and security—and all thanks to the unsolicited help of a truly humble local hero. Any arguments to the contrary aside, Van De Riet sees nothing particularly out of the ordinary about his willingness not only to aid a pair of total strangers in distress, but to go the extra mile to ensure their furry friends were safe as well. “It was the least I could do. I would expect anyone in this province to do the same thing if they were in my shoes,” Van De Riet told CBC. “It just happened to be that I was the one that was there first, I guess. [I’m no] Good Samaritan… It’s just the Nova Scotia way.” While we can only hope everyone in Nova Scotia shares this unselfish outlook on life, we’d certainly like to send out a sincere thank you to Mr. Van De Riet’s parents for raising such a truly thoughtful and compassionate son.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/stranger-takes-in-2-dogs-after-car-accident-matthew-van-de-riet/
"A 40-year-old inventor in the Philippines has apparently set a world record for longest flight by a hoverboard. Kyxz Mendiola launched his personal aircraft, called the Koncepto Milenya, from a beach and flew for seven minutes and 22 seconds—a distance of 1.79 miles / 2.89km. Footage shot in Zambales province on July 10 shows the Filipino, who is a drone and flying car enthusiast, gliding 30-feet above the ground, over water and fishing boats, while the water rippled below. The flight reportedly surpassed the Guinness World record set in 2016 by Frenchman Franky Zapata who flew a jet-powered hoverboard across a distance of 2.25km. “Our flight data indicated that we actually achieved 2.89km. I could not believe it,” said the delighted inventor and professional hip-hop dancer. “It was more than what we were expecting.” : “Our original goal was to fly across 2.5km. It was so overwhelming and I could not believe that it will go that far.” The feat is yet to be officially recognized by Guinness but it has already been submitted by the inventor’s team for validation. “My message to the young generation is don’t let other people stop you from achieving your dreams,” said Mendiola. the fantastic video below – …",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/watch-filipino-fly-his-hoverboard-for-2-miles-for-world-record/
"Our partner Rob Brezsny provides his weekly wisdom to enlighten our thinking and motivate our mood. Rob’s , is a syndicated weekly column appearing in over a hundred publications. He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com CANCER (June 21-July 22): Cancerian poet says she doesn’t like to be parched. She wants to be like “a tree drinking the rain.” I think every Cancerian has similar dreams: to be steadily immersed in engrossing feelings, awash with intimate longings, flowing along in rhythm with the soul’s songs. The coming weeks will be prime time for you to relish these primal pleasures. It’s probably best to avoid an outright flood, but I think it’s wise to invite a cascade. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Actor had a starring role in director Steve McQueen’s film . She praised his directorial skills. She loved the fact that he told her, “Fail, and then fail better.” Why? “That kind of environment, where failure is an option, is magical,” she said. It allowed her to experiment freely, push herself beyond her previous limits, and focus on being true to the character she was playing rather than trying to be a “good actor.” I think these are excellent principles for you to keep in mind during the coming weeks. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Virgo-born is a legendary jazz composer and saxophonist. He has been making music for over 60 years, often with other legendary creators like Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock. T described Shorter as “jazz’s greatest living small-group composer and a contender for greatest living improviser.” Bass prodigy Tal Wilkenfeld, who is 53 years younger than Shorter, tells the story of a show she performed with him. Just before going on stage, Shorter came up to her, sensing she was nervous, and whispered some advice: “Play eternity.” Now I’m offering that same counsel to you as you carry out your tasks in the coming days. Be as timeless as you dare to be. Immerse yourself in the most expansive feelings you can imagine. Authorize your immortal soul to be in charge of everything you do. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Libran author says the word “paradise” is derived from the ancient Persian word , meaning “walled garden.” For her, this association suggests that making promises and being faithful to our intentions are keys to creating happiness with those we care for. Paradise requires walls! To scrupulously cultivate freedom, we need discipline. If we hope to thrive in joyous self-expression, we must focus on specific goals. I bring these thoughts to your attention because now is a pivotal time to work on building, refining, and bolstering your own personal version of paradise. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Thousands of 28-pound bars of 24-carat gold are stored in the Bank of England’s underground vault. To gain entry to the treasure trove, bankers use metal keys that are three feet long. They must also utter a secret password into a microphone. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you Scorpios can now gain access to a more metaphorical but nevertheless substantial source of riches. How? The key is a particular scene in your imagination that has recently begun to coalesce. It is an emblem of a future triumph or breakthrough that you will accomplish. As for the password, which you will also need, it’s *vigorous rigor*. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Somehow, I have lived all these years without ever coming across the rare English word “selcouth.” Today, as I meditated on the exotic astrological portents coming up for you, that word appeared—arriving on my phone via text message from my Sagittarius friend Lila. She told me, “I have a feeling that life is about to get intensely for us Sagittarians.” I looked up the unfamiliar word and found these synonyms: unusual, marvelous, strange, magnificent, scarce, wondrous, weird, rare, and exotic. Those terms do indeed coincide with my interpretation of your immediate future. So to you, dear Centaur! Celebrate with awed appreciation! CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Lexicographer Jonathon Green provides us with the following 19th-century slang words for intercourse: horizontal refreshment, strumming, playing at romps, cully-shangie, taking a turn at Mount Pleasant, dancing the blanket hornpipe, honeyfugle, giving a hot poultice for the Irish toothache, and—my favorite—fandango de pokum. In accordance with astrological potentials, experiment with shifting your approach to life by being more playful. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): If a lover or spouse is perpetually churning out fantasies of you in their imagination, they may be less than totally tuned in to the real you. Instead, they may be focused on the images they have of you—maybe so much so that they lose sight of who you genuinely are and what you are actually doing. The same possibility exists for other allies, not only lovers and spouses. They may be so entranced by their stories about you that they are out of touch with the ever-changing marvel that you are always evolving. That’s the bad news, Aquarius. Here’s the good news: The coming weeks will be a decisive time to correct such distortions—and revel in the raw truth about you. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Here’s how art critic Walter Pater characterized the work of Piscean artist : “sweetness and strength, pleasure with surprise, an energy of conception which seems to break through all the conditions of comely form, recovering, touch by touch, a loveliness found usually only in the simplest natural things.” I’ve been waiting for the arrival of astrological aspects that would mean you’d be an embodiment of that description. And now they are here. Congrats! For the next 13 days, I will visualize you as a fount of ever-refreshing grace—as a fluid treasure that emanates refined beauty and wild innocence. ARIES (March 21-April 19): In his poem , Aries poet Billy Collins testifies that he is “the sound of rain on the roof.” He also claims to be “the moon in the trees, the paper blowing down an alley, the basket of chestnuts on the kitchen table, and the shooting star.” He does make it clear, however, that he is not “the bread and the knife” on the table, nor the “crystal goblet and the wine.” What about you, Aries? What are all the earthy and fiery phenomena that you are? Are you, as suggests, “the dew on the morning grass and the burning wheel of the sun and the marsh birds suddenly in flight”? Now would be an excellent time to dream up your own version of such colorful biographical details. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): “Why else keep a journal, if not to examine your own filth?” wrote poet . Most of us don’t need to focus obsessively on our unlovely aspects, so keeping a journal can be about identifying our ripening potentials and unused riches. This approach would be especially fun and wise for you Tauruses right now. The coming weeks will be an auspicious time for deep introspection that frees capacities and powers you have only partially activated up until now. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Journalist Sam Anderson marvels at his young daughter’s project: a small plastic dome-like structure that houses a community of ladybugs. All they need to consume, for weeks at a time, are “two water-soaked raisins.” I don’t think you’ll need to be forever as efficient and hardy as those ladybugs, Gemini, but you may have to be like that temporarily. My advice? Don’t regard it as a hardship. Instead, see it as an opportunity to find out how exquisitely resourceful and resilient you can be. The skills you learn and refine now will be priceless in the long run.

"A few weeks ago, the CBS Evening News featured a rural South Carolina man who is transforming lives by repairing broken cars and giving them away for free. Where Eliot Middleton lives, there’s no public transportation, no Ubers or taxi’s. So, if you don’t have a car, there are few options for those with kids or physical conditions. Middleton, who owns a barbecue restaurant, is also a trained mechanic who rehabs donated cars in his spare time. Before the CBS report, he had gifted 32 cars to rural families since last September. But, after aired on nationwide TV, Eliot received an explosion of donations including more than 800 cars. A flood of cash also poured in to —$129,000—and he has thousands of notes from folks offering their help and services to assist his mission. Someone even donated a flatbed truck to help him move all these cars from all over the country. “My phone started exploding from all over the place,” he told CBS reporter Mark Strassmann from his home in Awendaw. : Middleton’s sister is helping organize the overwhelming response, also pouring in through Eliot’s Facebook page, . “Whatever glowing feeling is inside me, it just transferred from that TV screen and went inside them,” he said. “It’s soul-soothing.” ( the heartwarming video below… *NOTE: If you are outside the U.S. …)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/donations-flood-in-for-rural-mechanic-who-fixes-cars-for-needy/
"LEGO recently announced they now have a prototype brick made from recycled plastic that lives up to company standards for the iconic building toy. The new prototype uses PET plastic from discarded bottles, yet it meets all the company’s strict quality and safety requirements. A team of more than 150 scientists and engineers are working to find sustainable solutions for LEGO products. Over the past three years, they’ve tested over 250 variations of PET materials and hundreds of other formulations. The result is a brick that meets several play requirements—including clutch power. ( ) “We are super excited about this breakthrough,” says the Vice President of Environmental Responsibility at LEGO, Tim Brooks. “The biggest challenge on our sustainability journey is rethinking and innovating new materials that are as durable, strong and high quality as our existing bricks—and fit with LEGO elements made over the past 60 years.” However, it will be some time before bricks made from a recycled material appear in stores. The next phase of testing is expected to take at least a year, but they do have a patent pending on the material formulation which “increases the durability of PET to make it strong enough for LEGO bricks.” : “Even though it will be a while before they will be able to play with bricks made from recycled plastic, we want to let kids know we’re working on it and bring them along on the journey with us.” says Brooks. “Experimentation and failing is an important part of learning and innovation. Just as kids build, unbuild and rebuild with LEGO bricks at home, we’re doing the same in our lab.” The prototype is made from from suppliers in the United States that use US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and European Food Safety Authority approved processes to ensure quality. On average, a one-liter plastic PET bottle provides enough raw material for ten small LEGO bricks. : In 2020, the company announced it will begin removing single-use plastic from its boxes. And, the company said it will invest up to US $400 million over three years to 2022 to accelerate its sustainability ambitions. how they’re transforming plastic waste…",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/first-lego-from-recycled-plastic/
"When friends try to hold you back from being too generous and kind, you know you’re doing something right. When icy temperatures this past winter froze Kodak, Tennessee, shutting power down and freezing pipes, Sean Patel, owner of the local Quality Inn, wanted to do something to help his neighbors: open his hotel to all comers, even if he ran out of rooms, and provide them food and warmth until the power came back on. “I frequently ask him to dial it back a bit because I know he’s spending so much of his own money and energy to help others, but he has such a big heart, I know he will only give more,” says his friend Steve Smith, who nominated the Quality Inn for . But Patel wouldn’t listen. The immigrant from India, who came to America in 2004, saw goodness in the people around him when he settled in Tennessee—and wanted to be a part of it. “I saw how much people helped each other in the South and it got to me,” explains Patel. “It’s not always about money. Sometimes you just need to talk. I always wanted to be that kind of person.” : So, he did what came naturally: Patel took to social media to say, “If you can get here, we will take care of you.” Even at maximum capacity, Patel would make space for those who needed it whether that be in the lobby or around the pool area, just so they could have someplace warm to be. Between Christmas and New Years of 2020, all 60 rooms in the hotel were completely booked with some rooms housing as many as eight or nine adults. Some guests even stayed in the lobby or meeting rooms just to have a warm place to be. A couple rooms under maintenance were used so guests in the lobby could take a shower, which Patel’s team sanitized thoroughly after each user. People came together in ways that Patel has never seen before. Everyone pitched in. Some guests even paid for each other’s rooms. Everyone was sharing food. The hotel staff turned on their breakfast station so people wouldn’t have to worry. Later in the winter, when a similar freeze hit Texas, Patel did the same with another hotel he owns, the Segovia Lodge. Power lines came down and pipes froze over as the cold engulfed an unprepared Texas. Patel waived all fees so anyone who could get to the hotel could stay and eat for free all week. Guests even walked to the hotel because their cars couldn’t get through. The hotel eventually lost electricity and stranded truckers took turns staying up all night to keep a fire going. All of the rooms were full, yet Patel opened the lobby floor so more guests could be sheltered. With over 200 people at the hotel, there wasn’t any fuss. No one argued. Everyone made sure the others were comfortable, warm, and fed as they took turns cooking for each other. : “It wasn’t about who was Black, White, Democrat, Republican. COVID, or no COVID, everyone was a family,” says hotel manager Shelly Shirley. All the guests who were at the Segovia Lodge during the freeze have even kept in touch via a Facebook group! They check in on each other and keep up with news from each other’s lives. “Business is down, but I still have clothes on my back, the kids were safe, we had a shower and food,” says Patel. “We all have to look out for each other.” That’s why GNN voted for Patel’s hotels to be the this year, and why, if you are ever in need of a hotel room in Kodak, Tennessee (30 minutes from Knoxville), or Junction, Texas (1.5 hours outside of San Antonio), you should definitely vote with your wallet and visit Sean. :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nicest-places-sean-patel-hotels/
"These touching pictures show a man taking his dying pet dog up his favourite mountain on one last walk—in a wheelbarrow. Ten-year-old Monty enjoyed exploring hills and walks all over Wales with his owner Carlos Fresco. The pair have visited the Brecon Beacons many times over the years, and have even summited the three peaks. But after becoming aware the labradoodle wasn’t very well, Carlos decided to return to the beacons, staying with friends in Brecon, so they could share one last journey together. Carlos and Monty travelled up to the peak of Pen y Fan—where many walkers stopped to say hello and meet Monty, who was helped to the top with the aid of a wheelbarrow. Monty passed away on June 21 after an 18-month battle with leukaemia. Carlos said: “I knew Monty was dying as his cancer had returned. He was diagnosed 18 months ago and responded very well to chemotherapy. “But unfortunately his leukaemia returned eight weeks ago and he declined very rapidly. He loved hill walks and we improvised and took him on trips around your wonderful beacons. Although he was weak he enjoyed all the fuss and attention received by so many well wishers. “In fact total strangers asked if they could share in pushing Monty on his last journey—and many total strangers shed a tear as we all love dearly our little four-legged friends. “That little guy touched so many lives. Made everyone he came into contact with smile and just take a moment to reflect how sometimes life’s not that bad. “Our little companions are never judgemental, are always there waiting for you and offer comfort when things haven’t gone well. “He was truly a special boy,” Carlos said. “God bless and goodnight little fella.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/man-gives-his-terminally-ill-dog-one-last-walk-up-their-beloved-mountain-in-a-wheelbarrow-photos/
"What do you get when you surprise random people with an unexpected dance party on the streets of New York? Pure joy, community, and connection. The inspiring street performance group placed a decal on the pavement in a park that read, “stand here for dance party.” Designed in the style of the ubiquitous social distancing circles, most passersby ignored it, or took photos, once they read its appealing message. But whenever anyone followed the instructions and put their feet directly on the decal in Grand Army Plaza in Manhattan, they instantly found themselves surrounded by a 100-person dance party featuring a vintage 1980s boombox. The group that specializes in large-scale surprise moments in public was eager to get back to their joyful antics, so they kicked off their first post-pandemic project by partnering with a fully-vaxed professional b-boy dance crew, the Dynamic Rockers, and the , which opened a new music-themed exhibit— . 100 undercover dancers recruited by were blending in the area, walking around the sidewalks or sitting on benches, just waiting for someone to stand on the decal, triggering a massive dance party.

"One man’s trash is another man’s treasure, they say. Well, in a South Korean school, one man’s poo is another man’s pennies. The invention of a toilet that composts human excrement and turns it into methane biogas for use in the school’s energy system has the students there re-evaluating waste like never before, as the amount of waste they contribute to the electric bills is returned to them in the form of a digital currency. The dirty mind behind the brilliant invention was Cho Jae-weon, an urban and environmental engineering professor at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), who insists that humanity can solve all kinds of problems if we think “outside the box.” Known as the BeeVi toilet, a condensed form of “bee” and “vision,” the compost/currency commode uses a powerful vacuum to pull feces down into a composting tank, thereby eliminating all water usage. Next, bacteria breakdown the feces and the methane is channeled into a solid-oxide fuel cell which powers several building functions such as the hot water heater. On average, a human’s daily excrement can generate around 0.5 kilowatt hours of electricity. “If we think out of the box, feces has precious value to make energy and manure. I have put this value into ecological circulation,” Cho told Along side the BeeVi, Cho created a digital token, called the “Ggool,” or honey in Korean, which students can earn by using the toilet. They can then take their feces financing and spend it on coffee and other items in the school cafeteria. “I had only ever thought that feces are dirty, but now it is a treasure of great value to me,” postgraduate student Heo Hui-jin told , in what must have been a fairly uncomfortable conversation.

"Despite hardships from Covid, drought, heatwaves, wildfires, and resurgent inflation, three in five Americans say they are pretty happy with their lot, according to the latest Gallup Live Evaluation Index. The percentage of Americans who evaluated their lives to be ‘thriving’ reached 59.2% in June, the highest in over 13 years of ongoing measurement—and exceeding the previous high of 57.3% from September 2017. During the initial COVID-19 outbreak and economic shutdown, the thriving percentage plunged nearly 10 percentage points to 46.4% by late April 2020, tying the record-low measured during the recession that began in 2008. The June 2021 results are based on 4,820 U.S. adults surveyed online as a part of the Gallup Panel, a probability-based, non-opt-in group of about 120,000 adults across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. For its Index, Gallup classifies Americans as “thriving,” “struggling” or “suffering” according to how they rate their current and future lives on a scale from 0 to 10. Those who rate their current life a 7 or higher, and their anticipated life in five years an 8 or higher, are classified as thriving. : The percentage of Americans estimated to be “suffering” has remained steadily low throughout the pandemic and in line with pre-COVID estimates, in a news release. In June, just 3.4% of respondents were classified as suffering, according to their own assessments. The major drop in the thriving percentage last year was characterized by a severe drop in current life satisfaction ratings. By late April, the percentage of U.S. adults who rated their current lives a “7” or higher had plunged about 11 percentage points, even as the anticipated life satisfaction five years forward had improved. “The rapid recovery of current life satisfaction, coupled with the sustained elevated level of anticipated life satisfaction, has fueled the thriving percentage to its current heights.” In addition to the general life ratings, Gallup tracks whether Americans have recently experienced specific emotions, including stress and worry, in their daily lives. The percentage of people who reported experiencing significant stress and worry “a lot of the day yesterday” showed unprecedented increases at the beginning of the pandemic, with stress rising 14 percentage points to 60% and worry rising 20 points to 58%. Reports of experiencing these emotions have subsequently fallen to pre-pandemic levels in both cases. : Significant daily enjoyment has also markedly improved. In 2018-2019, about 80% of U.S. adults reported significant enjoyment the day before, which plunged to 61% at the onset of the pandemic. By June, enjoyment was back up to 73% of the adult population. More than being a result of the vaccination rollout or improving economic conditions, the authors of the study theorize that the happiness boom was a result of the critical psychological benefit of renewed social interaction. Reuniting in person with family and friends and joining in large gatherings of people such as at sporting events is a crucial part of social wellbeing. Past research has shown that those who spend six to seven hours a day in social time experience about one-fifth the stress and worry on any given day as those with no social time at all. These effects are likely on display as the levels of these negative emotions have improved to pre-pandemic levels in recent months. : It just goes to show: life’s ups are more powerful after you’ve been through the downs.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/more-americans-consider-themselves-now-to-be-thriving-than-at-any-point-in-13-years-gallop/
"“The future belongs to renewable energy,” is a big thing for Big Oil’s fourth biggest player, and Asia’s richest energy baron to say, but Mukesh Ambani is letting his money do the talking—all $10.1 billion of it. In late June the Chairman of Reliance Industries, one of the largest oil companies on the planet, announced a 750 billion rupee investment in a brand new renewable energy supply chain. While oil majors like Reliance, Shell, or ExxonMobil are often the chief targets of climate activists’ attentions, the resources these energy giants can bring towards stimulating renewable investment and production are sometimes greater . Furthermore, their decades of experience in the energy industry lends them certain insights into energy supply and demand trends that few others possess. “The age of fossil fuels, which powered economic growth globally for nearly three centuries, cannot continue much longer,” “The huge quantities of carbon it has emitted into the environment have endangered life on Earth.” 600 billion of the rupees will produce four “gigafactories” where solar arrays, hydrogen fuel cells, and battery grids will be produced, and another 150 billion will help reinforce the value chain through strategic partnerships. When large firms like Reliance get involved, especially in production, manufacturing costs for renewable energy as a whole go down, not only because of investments in research and development, but also through market competition, as providers undercut each other’s prices to offer the best deal for consumers or government energy agencies. The forecast for a renewable future is one shared by Greenland, which has announced that all future oil and mineral exploration will cease, citing climate concerns and desires to invest in green energy. Tens of billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions square-feet of natural gas are predicted to lie under receding ice sheets, but keeping them in the ground is the new edict from the recently elected Inuit government of the Ataqatigiit. “The future does not lie in oil. The future belongs to renewable energy, and in that respect we have much more to gain,” the Greenland government said in a statement, before adding it “wants to take co-responsibility for combating the global climate crisis.” Inhabited by 57,000 people, is that the country is dreaming of independence, as it receives two-thirds of its national wealth from Denmark as charity. In a sign of maturity from the fledgling state, Greenland has decided that a near-future of possible independence is not worth a long-term future of worsening climate change.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/indias-largest-oil-baron-and-greenland-say-no-to-oil/

The breathtaking field at Ardross Farm in Scotland spans 1.5 hectares—the size of four football pitches—and recently came into bloom five months after it was planted. Reverend Douglas Creighton from East Neuk Trinity Church came up with the idea for a sunflower field in a bid to bring people joy during the pandemic.

"The superconducting magnets which could be a key to powering an efficient nuclear fusion reactor were just turned on in the labs of an American firm. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS_ generated an electrical field of 20 tesla—the most powerful ever created on Earth; 50,000 times-stronger than the magnetosphere—for five hours. This gave scientists at CFS the confidence to say that a working prototype of their fusion reactor could be ready by 2025; a huge leap forward from a that reckoned on a 2040 arrival time. Nuclear fusion is perhaps the world’s most dynamic engineering challenge, and the magnets are one method by which humans may be able to make it work. With them, CFS believe the reactors of the future could be small, and dramatically cheaper than the billions Western governments are on fusion projects. The goal of any reactor is to create a plasma—the forth state of matter, which is essentially a superheated gas. The heavy isotopes inside a hydrogen atom, deuterium and tritium, are heated inside the reactor to hundreds of millions of degrees until they convert to helium. The energy they give off is converted to electricity. If such a powerful machine can produce more electricity than it uses, unlimited clean energy can be achieved, which means it doesn’t matter if the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, it means coal, oil, and gas can all remain in the ground, that never again would a war be fought over oil resources, and that global climate change could be rapidly scaled back. In fact, the CFS research and development team that their reactor will be able to turn a glass of water into the electricity usage of one human for their entire lifetime. Superconducting magnets make achieving those extreme temperatures much easier. 18 of CFS’ magnets will be arranged like a big metal donut to create pressures in the fusion chamber, known as a tokamak, of up to two-times as much as at the deepest point in the ocean. This immense squeezing causes the immense heat needed for fusion to occur. “Three years ago we announced a plan to build a 20-tesla magnet, which is what we will need for future fusion machines,” says Bob Mumgaard, CFO of CFS, in a story to the . “We now have a platform that is both scientifically very well-advanced, because of the decades of research on these machines, and also commercially very interesting. What it does is allow us to build devices faster, smaller, and at less cost.” The magnets are wrapped with 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of superconducting tape made from a barium copper oxide. This tape has taken decades to develop, and when cooled to -253 °C, which used to take a refrigerator the size of a house, it removes all the natural barriers to superconductivity, and can easily handle nearly all of the 40,000 amps passing through the tokamak at any one time, and very efficiently. All of this work, and the successful test, means that CFS can begin work on their SPARC, a sort of miniature version of a full-scale nuclear fusion plant. The facility to house the SPARC is already under construction.

"On a farm where cows freely relieve themselves as they graze, the accumulation and spread of waste often contaminates local soil and waterways. This can be controlled by confining the cows in barns, but in these close quarters their urine and feces combine to create ammonia, an indirect greenhouse gas. In an article published on September 13 in the journal , researchers show that cows can be potty-trained, enabling waste to be collected and treated, thereby cleaning up the barn, reducing air pollution, and creating more open, animal-friendly farms. “It’s usually assumed that cattle are not capable of controlling defecation or urination,” says co-author Jan Langbein, an animal psychologist at the Research Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN) in Germany, but he and his team questioned this thinking. “Cattle, like many other animals or farm animals are quite clever and they can learn a lot. Why shouldn’t they be able to learn how to use a toilet?” To potty-train the calves, a process they dubbed MooLoo training, the research team with scientists from FBN, FLI (Germany) and the University of Auckland (New Zealand) worked backward. They started off by rewarding the calves when they urinated in the latrine, and then they allowed the calves to approach the latrines from outside when they needed to urinate. The ammonia produced in cow waste doesn’t directly contribute to climate change, but when it is leached into the soil, microbes convert it into nitrous oxide, the third-most important greenhouse gas after methane and carbon dioxide. Agriculture is the largest source of ammonia emissions, with livestock farming making up over half of that contribution. “You have to try to include the animals in the process and train the animals to follow what they should learn,” says Langbein. “We guessed it should be possible to train the animals, but to what extent we didn’t know.” To encourage latrine use, the researchers wanted the calves to associate urination outside the latrine with an unpleasant experience. “As a punishment we first used in-ear headphones and we played a very nasty sound whenever they urinated outside,” says Langbein. “We thought this would punish the animals—not too aversively—but they didn’t care. Ultimately, a splash of water worked well as a gentle deterrent.” Over the course of a few weeks, the research team successfully trained 11 out of the 16 calves in the experiment—which has been published in . Remarkably, the calves showed a level of performance comparable to that of children and superior to that of very young children. Langbein is optimistic that with more training that this success rate can be further improved. “After ten, fifteen, twenty years of researching with cattle, we know that animals have a personality, and they handle different things in a different way. They are not all the same.” Now that the researchers know how to potty-train cows, they want to transfer their results into real cattle housing and to outdoor systems. Langbein hopes that “in a few years all cows will go to a toilet,” he says.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cows-potty-trained-save-planet-germany/
"An abandoned airport in Taiwan has been chosen as the stage for an exciting project in landscape architecture, blending green spaces with sensory experiences to create a refuge in one of the island’s biggest and most crowded cities. The Phase Shift Park in Taichung will include 200 different plant species, and 10,000 trees to shade residents from humidity, but the real spectacle will be 12 urban landscape installations, corresponding with the philosopher Rudolf Steiner’s ‘Principle of the 12 Senses’. Taichung’s air isn’t actually that bad, as most neighborhoods are labeled as “good” on the World Air Quality Index, however sitting just beneath of the Tropic of Cancer, and , one of the largest marine currents on Earth, the hot, humid, and sticky air can be stifling in the summertime, holding water vapor and toxic particulates from car exhaust down near the ground. The trees were chosen to offer maximum shade, and are built alongside winding lanes going from north to south, and through unique installations that play on Steiner’s senses of speech, taste, hearing, equilibrium, thinking, vision, movement, ego, touch, warmth, smell, and life. Passing through the park, there’s a lake designed specifically to create lifelike echoes, and a field of flowers cultivated specifically to envelope it with an intoxicating curtain of perfumes. Designed by French architecture firm the topography was carefully designed to maximize water permeation during the wet monsoon season. Underneath the soil lies complex that will ideally allow the rains to refuel the trees year-round. The concept art and preliminary images show a futuristic landscape rather than a natural oasis. It will do as much to bring tourists to the city as offer shelter, fresh air, and a play space for local residents. Steiner believed that the world was essentially an indivisible entity, and that it’s our consciousness which divides it into split realms of sensory experience. It’s a fascinating guide with which to experience something like a park, and one which speaks to the breadth of our potential to connect with nature even in somewhere as dense as the urban center of Taichung.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/phase-shift-landscape-park-in-taichung-offers-sensory-experience-and-respite/

"Out between Mars and Jupiter in the solar system’s asteroid belt, there’s a lump of iron and nickel called 16 Psyche that has a value of $10,000 quadrillion: that’s 70,000-times more than the entire world economy. With measurements of its density paired with its 140 mile-diameter, recent telescopic surveys with different spectrums of UV light have confirmed the asteroid to be around 90% iron, adding the last value in the equation to give 16 Psyche its . Sitting 230 million miles from Earth, it offers a much different kind of value to scientists, namely to study one of the largest entirely-metal objects in the solar system, one which scientists believe could be a protoplanet that was disrupted during natural formation. It’s now the subject of a that will send an orbiter on a 3.5 year-mission to study a new type of world made of metal. The orbiter will try to determine whether it’s simply a mass of iron and nickel, or indeed a planet’s core, as well as its age, and whether it can contain lighter elements found in Earth’s high-pressure core. “We’ve seen meteorites that are mostly metal, but Psyche could be unique in that it might be an asteroid that is totally made of iron and nickel,” Dr. Tracy Becker, an expert on 16 Psyche from the Southwest Research Institute. “Earth has a metal core, a mantle and crust. It’s possible that as a Psyche protoplanet was forming, it was struck by another object in our solar system and lost its mantle and crust.” Becker, who published a UV-light observation study of the asteroid last year, considers it a chance “to understand what really makes up a planet and to potentially see the inside of a planet.” But how is it that so much heavy metal should congregate outside of a festival ground in Germany? Vice President of Arizona State University’s interplanetary initiative, Lindy Elkins-Tanton, spoke with in early July to explain. “It’s not the Death Star,” says Elkins-Tanton. “It turns out that we know this from meteorites; that the most primitive material, the building blocks of planets [are] little bits of metal and little bits of rock all mixed together.” “And when you put all that material clumped together into a [a tiny planet] they’re heated up by early short lived radioisotopes,” she said. This melting forces the metal down, as it’s denser than the comparatively porous rocky material present on the asteroid or planet, forming the metallic core. “We’ve got a big clump of metal, our core, inside of the Earth,” said Elkins-Tanton. “There’s one inside of the Moon, amazingly, inside of Mars, inside of Mercury, inside of Venus, but we never, ever get to see them. So Psyche gives us, we think, a way to see the core of a planetesimal, maybe the only way humans will ever see a core if our ideas are right.” This would be the true price tag of 16 Psyche, because even if we could somehow bring back all that iron, the supply-demand laws of economics would bring the price of iron down to levels in the hundredths of a cent.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/16-psyche-asteroid-value-as-a-protoplanetary-core-and-a-huge-piece-of-iron/
"If you’re the mayor of a rustic 800 year-old town with just 1,000 people, how can you stop the town from fading away as young people move to the major cities? How about you sell all the empty properties for one euro? 44 towns in Italy are currently listed under the €1.00 House Project, which serves the triple-purpose of saving old abandoned real estate from condemnation, repopulating historic towns with dwindling populations, and allowing young people a super-easy entrance into the real estate market for the purposes of investment or starting a family. These towns are the kinds of places that we Americans could never believe could be abandoned, and that delight us with their antiquity. The allows mayors of small towns to put their empty properties up for sale for just one euro. Housing agreements are for three years typically, and struck with a deposit of €5,000 euro from the buyer to ensure the property will be restored. A detailed plan of the restoration, be it for the purpose of a restaurant, a B&B, or a normal home, must be agreed upon, and at least semi-permanent residence is encouraged, reports Here are some other towns looking for fresh oxygen. The , or “feather,” is located in the La Spezia Province of southeast Liguria, near the Cinque Terre National Park, made famous by Rick Steves. “Ancient is the history of Pignone that dates back to some finds in the Bronze Age,” writes the listing on the €1.00 House Project website. “The village is without walls but the compactness of the houses, leaning against each other, forms a defensive barrier along the canal that crosses it. To enter the village you have to cross a characteristic Romanesque bridge in the form of a “donkey’s back” built around 1500.” As part of the Valley of Vara, Pignone is the sight of corn, legume, and potato cultivation, the former of which is very important as it goes towards the production of polenta, a regional staple. Every year at the end of summer, a farmer’s festival is held in town attended by hundreds of people to showcase the local products. A hilly town about 900 feet above sea level, is inhabited by around 6,000 people and has the honor of being included in the club of the most beautiful villages in Italy. Founded by Arabs around 1,000 CE, the city center still carries many of the architectural motifs of the Islamic travelers. It was one of the first towns to offer old houses for €1.00, and it’s famous for sheep cheese, focaccia, and is part of the National Association of Wine Cities. There’s regular theater, hiking on the nearby mountain, and a short drive to the beach. Literally what’s not to love? Located in one of the lesser-known regions of Italy, that offers perspective home buyers a totally different kind of Italy. “The mayor Stefania Clos is eager to repopulate her mountain village, where 200 people currently reside,” reads the listing on the website. “From Roman times, the town of Oyace has its main economic resource in the breeding of livestock and [is] an excellent producer of Fontina.” A hearth and stove in Oyace gives the strong-legged homeowner access to the highest massifs in Europe, for trekking, stargazing, camping, skiing, and more.

Numerous nearby churches lie carved into the walls of cliffs or established in caves, while the agropastoral life which dominated this elevated volcanic plain means that amazing local meat and cheese is available for cheap. “For those who love nature and immersion in ancient history, Sardinia and the municipality of Romana are the right place to plan your dream 1 Euro House Project,” writes the website. “We must not forget that you are only a 45-minute drive away from the most beautiful sea in Sardinia.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/1-euro-houses-available-across-italy-with-a-5000-euro-deposit/
"As city officials wrangle under the pressure to reduce urban violence and deal with demands from police unions, homeowners’ associations, and gun lobbyists, residents in some of the most violent neighborhoods in the country have opted instead to pull up a chair, and have a sit down. One such movement has been the 21 Days of Peace event in Minneapolis, a place where, even before the death of George Floyd, sometimes saw 11 homicides a month. Here, community and church congregation members are simply seating themselves in lawn chairs on street corners in the most dangerous neighborhoods, and acting as “violence interrupters”—and police statistics show it’s working. Compared to last summer, in June 2021 homicide numbers took a dive during the , and continued to stay low in the following months, along with incidents of rape and aggravated assault. “Our group asked the Minneapolis Police Department to identify the most dangerous spots in our neighborhood, the 4th Precinct, and then we went there, pulled out our chairs and sat down,” write Louis King and Jerry McAfee, in an King is president and chief executive of Summit Academy OIC in Minneapolis, and McAfee is pastor of the city’s New Salem Missionary Baptist Church, but both are part of this new wave of violence interrupters. “Too many leaders are responding by adopting a Nixonian ‘tough on crime’ stance—which usually translates into over-policing and under-supporting these communities,” they wrote. “The people sitting on these corners in their chairs are members of the community. We know our young people, and they know us.” Similar movements of violence interruption have broken out with success in Nashville, where the groups are working through community outreach to rebuild trust and using successful de-escalation to decrease crime by 40%, while arrests plummeted. AP reports that in the areas where the Dream Center operates, crime has fallen 40%, giving a totally new perspective to police departments that for years had adopted tough-on-crime policies. “We thought that was going to make it safer, and what we ended up doing was breaking down trust in those communities,” said police Lt. Jason Picanzo, who works with West Nashville Dream Center. Now, he says, it is the community that has made these neighborhoods safer. Back in Minneapolis, King and McAfee believe that the moral bastion of the Black Church gives them a unique advantage over the police forces. They site similar examples in where church groups are doing more for underserved communities, and at the same time reducing violence. “We draw on the power of congregation—of family, of friends, and of community to try to interrupt the violence. And our faith gives us the courage to put ourselves in harm’s way,” they wrote. It’s a strong gesture to unfold and lawn chair and simply sit where many people fear even to drive. Violence of any kind, whether it involves us or not, is a difficult situation to risk being caught up in, but desperate times also call on our ‘better angels’—and these Minnesotans are stretching their wings. “We’re not declaring victory, by any means. But as elected officials look for answers to end the violence, they would be wise to pull up a chair and take a look at what’s working.” :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/minneapolis-nashville-and-baltimore-violence-interrupters/
"At age 6, Chad Keller already knew he wanted to be an astronaut, but his vision wasn’t sharp enough to pass the military requirements to become a fighter pilot. Instead, never losing sight of his dream, Keller pursued a degree in aerospace engineering, hoping to someday make it into space. On September 11, 2001 the 29-year-old U.S. Department of Defense and National Reconnaissance Office satellite propulsion specialist was on his way home to California after attending a series of launch meetings at the Pentagon. At 9:37 a.m., the plane he was on—American Airlines Flight 77—crashed into the Pentagon. Keller’s life ended that day, but thanks to the efforts of NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy, close to 20 years on, his space mission dreams were finally made a reality. A former Navy SEAL platoon commander, Cassidy spent two tours in the Middle East in the aftermath of 9/11. He began training to become an astronaut in 2004 at the end of his second deployment. Cassidy’s NASA career highlights include crewing aboard the Endeavor shuttle in 2009, two tours on the International Space station, and 10 spacewalks. According to Cassidy, NASA allows astronauts to bring a selection of small personal keepsakes—such as photos, patches, or pins—along with them on their missions. For his first two space outings, Cassidy concentrated on mementos from his family but for his final mission in 2020, he wanted to share the unique and meaningful opportunity with someone who’d truly appreciate it. After reading about Chad Keller’s lifelong passion for space travel at New York City’s National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Cassidy knew he’d found a kindred spirit. Cassidy reached out to Keller’s father, Richard, with a proposition: He was heading into space soon and wondered if Chad would like to tag along. Richard’s answer was a resounding, “Yes!” On April 2020, when Cassidy and the rest of his crew lifted off, pins from Chad’s days at Boeing and the University of Colorado, a program from his memorial service, a snapshot of Chad and his wife Lisa, and some of his ashes went with him. To round out the collection, Cassidy also brought commemorative items from the 9/11 Museum. Over the course of the mission, with a stunning backdrop of the Earth behind them, Cassidy photographed each item from his inventory in the space station’s observatory cupola. Along with documenting moments in history, he also sent out messages of hope to the people on the planet below. “With each item that I pull out, I always pause for a second to think a little bit about the story to that particular item,” Cassidy told . “It’s kind of special to think about the story and the path, the journey of that object from the hands that it was in to my hands to this window.” In the 20 years since Chad Keller’s passing, his family had a mission of their own—to scatter his ashes at the places that held the greatest meaning to him. Thanks to Cassidy, they were finally able to send them to the one place he’d always most wanted to go—space. Now retired from NASA, Cassidy is currently overseeing the construction of the National Medal of Honor Museum and Medal of Honor Leadership Institute in Arlington, Texas, and the National Medal of Honor Monument in Washington, D.C. While Cassidy and the Kellers have yet to meet in person, the bond they forged in bringing Chad’s dream to life is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of tragedy; one told from a perspective that’s both humbling and hopeful. “The world would be a better place if every human being got five minutes to look out that window of the space station,” Cassidy told CNN. “It made me more appreciative for everything that Earth offers to us. Friendships, connections, and shared experiences are all that much more meaningful to me now.” And that is a take-away that’s universal. “The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be,” Carl Sagan wrote. If we can simply remember that we’re part of something larger than ourselves, then whether we’re earthbound or breaking the bonds of gravity, in the here and now or part of what’s come before, all of us are sailing among the stars.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/astronaut-brings-ashes-and-photos-of-9-11-victim-to-space-fulfilling-his-lifelong-dream-of-orbiting-for-nasa/
"Meet the man and jackdaw who have an adorable bond after a chance roadside encounter, and now even go on bicycle rides together. 55-year-old Michael Smith spotted an injured baby jackdaw lying on the roadside as he cycled home one evening in May. He scooped up the tiny bird, now named Patch, and took him home where he made him a little nest and fed him scrambled eggs. Now recovered, and about 16 weeks old, Patch has spread his wings, but comes back to his rescuer when Michael calls. Bird and man have such a close relationship that Patch gives his friend little beaky kisses and hitches lifts on his bike rides and walks. Patch has been a celebrity guest at a wedding, and Michael loves him so much he even slept rough one night when his feathered friend didn’t come out of a tree. Michael, an ex-builder from Malvern in Worcestershire, said, “I love nature and animals, so I couldn’t leave him injured in the hedgerow. “He’s like my best friend now, and I spend as much time with him as possible. When I’m without him I’m thinking about him, and when I see him again he does a little joyful squark that is different from his normal screech. He’s the best pet and everyone loves him. He is the talk of the town, and if I’m without him everyone’s asking after him.” Michael suspected Patch, who he thinks is a boy, had been attacked by another animal when he found him with a mangled wing. After living in an old pigeon box Michael got from a friend, and tucking into scrambled and boiled eggs, bread and milk, Patch took four weeks to recover use of his wing. Michael still feeds Patch mealworms, and fruit like cherries and grapes, but the now-recovered bird catches moths, wasps, and flies for himself. Patch lives in an aviary that Michael built in the garden, but comes in for play dates and occasional sleepovers in the house Michael shares with his mother 78-year-old mother Mary. Michael said, “People call me the bird whisperer, or bird-man of Malvern. It came quite naturally to me. And I remembered all these tales I’ve heard about people rescuing birds and forming a bond.” “He sits on my shoulder and puts his little beak to my face or gently nibbles my ear. He lets me stroke him under his breast and his feathers on his back all quiver. And he lets me rub his beak. He’s so much fun. “I was quite well known around here but I’m even more so now: it’s a lovely thing to be known for,” said Michael. When out walking, he hops down to play in puddles, and once enjoyed paddling in a stream on a Malvern hills excursion. “Having him is such a lovely thing to happen.” ( Mike and Patch in the video below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/mike-and-jackdaw-best-friends-england/
"A company that GNN began supporting in 2017 when they were making fashion-forward scarves that filter the air at the level of N95 or higher, has gone above and beyond, producing a new single-use mask that closes the lifecycle loop for every wearer concerned about the environment—especially since the coronavirus has created so much landfill waste. The company, G95 (formerly Bioscarf) is so committed to sustainability, they began developing a special version of their filtration material after seeing the damage that discarded PPE was doing to our oceans since the pandemic began. Everything related to the newly developed mask—from the ear loops to the nose bridge—is made entirely using plant-based PLA materials which is 100% biodegradable. This includes the bags they ship in, the individual wrappers for each product, and the G95 filtration technology built-in. But how they’re “going beyond” is the best part. When you are done with the mask, instead of throwing it away, simply put it in the envelope that it arrived in, and mail it back to the company for free—and they will recycle them into new masks! If any of the masks do happen to reach the landfill or waterway, because they are 100% made out of plant-based materials, they will fully biodegrade in approximately 90 days. “Lab-tested & certified!” says the company’s founder, Carlton Solle, talking with GNN. “It’s the world’s first single-use mask made using 100% plant-based materials.” And they will give you a $1.00 store credit for every that you return for responsible disposal. Also, because Carlton and his co-founder, wife Hazel Solle, are serious about preventing masks from ending up polluting the ocean, you can send them used masks from ANY other manufacturers and receive a 25¢ in G95 store credit for each one shipped back. Insane brilliance, right? When you receive your shipment, carefully open it by using the tear strip on the back. Keep your bag because you’ll need it to mail back your used masks. At the end of each day, simply put your used mask into the bag, together with the wrapper it came in. When you have used up all of the masks, put them into the bag, place the enclosed mailing return sticker over the old sticker on the front of the bag. Be sure to fill out the enclosed card with your contact information and write in how many masks you are returning to receive the store credit mentioned earlier. “We’ve spent years developing these, and are really passionate about it,” says Solle. “Given the state of things, it will be a real game-changer.” During a business trip to China, Carlton Solle became ill, most likely due to complications related to air pollution. As an alternative to wearing an ugly mask to protect himself, . Back in Atlanta, his wife Hazel came up with the idea to design a product that would work both as a scarf and also a filter. (You might have seen the photo of our GNN founder wearing one during the wildfires in California when the air was so bad.) For people traveling outside the US, these masks are , and they have been submitted for FFP2 and CE registrations, so you can use them all around the world. Some European airlines may insist on FFP2-rated masks for boarding passengers. The company, G95, is currently shipping their products within 1-2 days for FREE—using USPS Priority Mail in the US—and they now over $100 FREE via UPS. If you enter the code at checkout you will get a 20% discount on any order over $100. The has a number of products that filter with their G95 technology, which they say is “like N95 on steroids.” Their hoodies and pullovers are designed to turn up to filter nose and mouth, and their gaiters and masks can be washed 50 times and still retain an N95 rating. They also have an informative . The is available now and sold in packs of 30 for $79 USD via the G95 website.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/plant-based-recycled-biodegradable-face-masks/
"The world’s largest floating office building opens in the Netherlands, where unsurprisingly it will host the offices of the Global Center on Adaptation. Anchored in the harbor of Rijnhaven in Rotterdam, both office and organization will make a fighting partnership in the attempts to lessen the impact of climate change on our society, particularly in a country that’s below the level of the sea. Floating Office Rotterdam, or FOR, was recently inaugurated by King Willem-Alexander, and former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon who heads the team taking up residence in the (48,500 square-foot), three-floor office space. Built of prefabricated timbers arranged atop 15 custom built concrete pontoons, the upper floors feature wrap around terraces to enjoy the view of the city. An overhanging roof shades the interior from the sun. Powering FOR is an 800 square-meter array of solar panels hooked up to batteries ashore. It also uses the northerly waters of the Dutch harbor as a heat sink to regulate temperatures in the offices without using climate control. Finally the offices are fully recyclable after the materials are no longer safe for continued use. “We designed our floating office to reflect the values of its inhabitants: the Global Center on Adaptation,” writes the architects of the FOR. “This Rotterdam-based NGO… aims at promoting planning, investment, and technology to mitigate climate change. “The carbon-neutral building is designed to be climate resilient and will float if sea levels rise due to climate change. Our climate-resilient office is both an illustration of the center’s mission and sets an example for how to build sustainable floating structures.” The Global Center on Adaptation has a lease in the building for ten years, after which it will move to another tenant.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/worlds-largest-floating-office-opens-in-rotterdam/
"A team of investigators has succeeded in restoring brain trauma by hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This is the first time in the scientific world that non-drug therapy has been proven effective in preventing the core biological processes responsible for the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Using a specific protocol of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), cerebral blood flow (CBF) improved/increased in elderly patients by 16-23%, alleviating vascular dysfunction and amyloid burden. The study from Tel Aviv University, part of a comprehensive research program directed toward aging and accompanying ailments as a reversible disease, holds promise for a new strategic approach to the prevention of Alzheimer’s by addressing not only the symptoms or targeting biomarkers, but rather the core pathology and biology responsible for the development of the disease. Hyperbaric medicine is a form of therapy that requires patients to be kept in special chambers in which the atmospheric pressure is much higher than that normally experienced at sea level. In addition, they breathe air composed of 100% oxygen. Hyperbaric medicine is considered safe and already serves to treat an extensive list of medical conditions. In recent years, scientific evidence has indicated that unique protocols of hyperbaric therapy are capable of inducing repair of damage brain tissue and renewed growth of blood vessels and nerve cells in the brain. The first stage of the study, published in journal, was carried out on an animal model, in the course of which it was proven conclusively through examination of brain tissues that a certain therapeutic protocol brings about an improvement in vascular function and the creation of new blood vessels. It also prevents the deposit of new amyloid plaques on the brain cells and even leads to the removal of existing amyloid plaque deposits. Amyloids are non-soluble proteins. Deposits of such proteins in the brain are connected with severe degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. At the next stage, the effects of the treatment were examined for people above the age of 65 with cognitive decline, with an emphasis on memory loss, a stage preceding Alzheimer’s and dementia. The therapy included a series of 60 session of HBOT unique in pressure chambers over a period of 90 days. The effects on the brain were evaluated by high resolution perfusion MRI. The hyperbaric treatment protocol gave rise to: increased blood flow in the range of 16%-23%; significant improved in memory by 16.5% on average, significant improvement in attention and information processing speed. Dr. Ronit Shapira said, “The combination of an animal model from which we could learn the pathology of the disease, together with existing and available therapy, raises the hope that we will now be able to fight one of the greatest challenges to the western world. “According to our findings, hyperbaric therapy given at a young age is likely to prevent this severe disease entirely.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy-reverses-hallmarks-of-alzheimers/
"Naturally regenerated forests are much better ways of achieving climate targets than mass planting, and Brazil could achieve 150% more reforestation if the forests are left to their own schemes. Home to a wealth of biodiversity that includes ocelots and golden lion tamarins, the Atlantic Forest biome is recognized as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and a Brazilian Natural Heritage site. However, it has lost nearly 80% of its original area due to logging and agricultural expansion, making it ideal for restoration initiatives, A report from finds that Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, the oft-ignored, great forest habitat in the country is a perfect site for natural reforestation. In a , seeking to map and quantify the potential for natural forest regeneration in the Atlantic Forests, the researchers found that of the current forest cover, which is around 34.1 million hectares (131,000 square miles) 8% was regenerated naturally between 1996 and 2015, but that another 20 million hectares could be reforested with a mix of natural and assisted strategies, between now and 2035, all the while saving around $90 billion in operation costs. The savings in dollars is key, since natural forest regeneration efforts of the total climate change funding in the world. Furthermore, tree planting and soil preparation between $1,400 and $34,000 per hectare. The Center for International Forestry Research feels the best bet for the world’s forests in a changing climate is to simply take our hands off the wheel. Several small examples of natural reforestation in Ireland and the UK, two nations keen on restoring past versions of their ecosystems, show the breadth of success one can have if one simply lets nature take its course. The rewilding project on the 3,500 acres of has created one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in lower England, while a 600 year-old 1,600 acre-estate in south Ireland has Natural regeneration has this potential, unsurprisingly, of restoring far more biodiversity, especially if helped along with seed dispersion, de-weeding, and other simple management strategies. A , when it looked at 133 papers on the topic and found that forest areas freed from agriculture and allowed to regenerate created 56% greater species richness in all categories of animals, and in five measures of vegetation structure: cover, density, litter, biomass, and height. “Instead of conserving with specific species in mind where you’re focusing on keeping a habitat, locking it down as it is, so that that preserves the numbers of certain species, what we’ve done here is just taken our hands off the steering wheel and just stood back and let nature take over,” said Isabella Tree, co-director of the rewilding project on the Knepp Estate. Another benefit is that naturally occurring forests trap far more carbon in the soil on average, as that regenerated forests absorb 32% more carbon above ground, and sequester 11% more below, than is generally estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. For these regenerated forests to last, however, the scientists and policy makers need to know the best way for locals and other interest groups to be motivated enough to leave the regenerating forests intact long-term. The article suggests that schemes like a payment system for rural dwellers who leave or protect and maintain stands of regenerated forests, or increased access to investment capital for agroforestry production, could be used to help convince those who rely on rural areas to leave the trees alone rather than turning them into wood chips.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/intead-of-mass-tree-planting-natural-regeneration-could-save-brazils-atlantic-forest/
"Way back in the mists of time, before Guttenberg’s printing press, before the Chinese invented parchment paper, before clay tablets and papyrus, humans passed information along through stories. It turns out those thousands of years of storytelling tradition may have actually altered our very biology, as a reveals that narrative stimuli, i.e. “Once upon a time,” or “My fellow Americans,” synchronizes the fluctuations of heart rates between the individuals listening. Human hearts don’t beat in perfect rhythm. Depending on a person’s level of physical fitness, fluctuations and variability in the regularity of those beats at rest can actually measure almost entire seconds. As strange as it sounds that a speaker and listeners’ hearts literally beat as one, further findings from the study reinforce the idea of storytelling as a biological determiner. For example, the matching of heart rates is determined by the attention paid by the listener to the speaker, and that this phenomenon predicts the memorization of the narrative content. This isn’t the first time this incredible connection with stories has been demonstrated to have a biological impact on humans. It’s that the brains of people watching films together tend to “tick collectively,” suggesting why films can be so enjoyable as a group activity, and why the greatest films affect us the way they do—because they are literally changing our biology into “pay attention and remember” mode. In the heart rate experiment, subjects were presented with a 1 minute audiobook snippet of Joules Verne’s . They found that there was significant correlation of heart rate synchronicity between subjects. To control for error, they gave all the subjects different 1 minute sections, and as predicted, the heart rate synchronicity dropped significantly. This explains why story time is such an effective teaching tool for kids. Distractions were found to disrupt this synchronicity, specifically when during the narrative stimuli, participants were asked to repeatedly count backwards. Most people can probably remember a live performance that held them in a spell, when the instruments were perfectly mixed, or the orchestra was in perfect harmony with the conductor.

"Humpback whales are among the largest, but most gentle and intelligent creatures on the planet. Humpback whales come to Tonga to breed and give birth because the waters are free of sharks and orcas that prey on the baby whales. The Polynesian island nation is also one of the few places on earth where humans can get in the water with humpbacks. Although there are strict rules about approaching whales, the mammals will, out of curiosity, approach humans. : Their massive bodies dwarf our own, but they seem to know their own strength, as there are many cases of whales intentionally showing their gentle side by avoiding inflicting injury. This very lucky swimmer was visited by a playful male humpback, who seemingly was rolling over for a belly rub. : It repeatedly rolled on its back, exposing its underside and swimming close to her—and the encounter went on for a full 18 minutes.

"How does the world’s fastest blind man run 100 meters in under 11 seconds without the ability to see a starting block, lane, or curvature of the track? A new documentary called provides the moving answer. After being diagnosed with Kawasaki disease as a toddler, David Brown was robbed of his sight by the time he was 13. A natural athlete, David eventually found a running guide to partner with—and became the Paralympic champion and world-record holder in 2014 as the only blind person ever to run the 100-meter in under 11 seconds. The 30-minute film portrays the unique brotherhood that Brown formed with Jerome Avery, while the two were ‘tethered’ in training for 15 years. Their inspiring story of companionship and abiding trust transcends the world of sport. : When David ran the world-record race with Jerome seven years ago, they were connected by an eight-inch cord. In the new film, you can see how it had been cut in half—to just four-inches—as their partnership and trust evolved with almost perfect synchronicity. Written by award-winning creative director Andy Fackrell, was filmed in the run-up to the Paralympic Games in Tokyo, which will be the first time that Brown will be untethered from his long-time running companion, after Jerome was injured in early 2021. “Being able to let go of all fears when deprived of sight and have faith in another human being, David puts his complete confidence in Jerome and strives to live without restraint,” says Feliciano Robayna, Head of Sports Marketing for , the Swiss company that made the film. “When you see Jerome and I run, it’s like one person,” says David. “I hope people can relate to when they see it and maybe even gain greater understanding of Paralympic sport when they watch the competitions at Tokyo this year.” The fact that Avery will not be running alongside David on September 1 in Tokyo, makes the film and its title even more compelling. : Now, the star sprinter becomes ‘Untethered’ to his longtime running guide, after training with a new one. features two headline entertainers, who surprise David for conversations in New York City, as well as an interview with his mother, Francine Brown, who recounts a 500-word winning essay that allowed him to attend the 2008 Paralympic Games in Beijing—and propelled his athletic career forward.

"After the COVID-19 pandemic and cancer delayed a young couple’s wedding day twice, the third time will surely be a ‘lucky’ charm, thanks to an innovative robotic surgery. Paul Hutchinson is tying the knot with fiancée Lisa Bamforth at St. John’s church in Lancashire today following an innovative procedure performed at a Manchester cancer center, The Christie. Thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, it allowed the groom diagnosed with testicular cancer to make it to the church—finally. The traditional treatment for his cancer which spread to his abdominal lymph nodes, would have involved major abdominal surgery necessitating intensive care, a seven day stay in hospital and a recovery time of several months. : Paul was considered a good candidate for the pioneering robotic treatment which involves keyhole surgery, directed by a surgeon and performed by the intricate robotic machinery. His hospital stay of just 48 hours and a home recovery of just a few weeks let Paul prepare for the big day with his fiancée and his two daughters. “I genuinely didn’t think we could go ahead with the wedding as I was convinced I would not be well enough,” Paul told . “The incredible robotic operation has dramatically reduced my recovery time and left me feeling fit and well.” The veteran can also get back to his job as an engineer within weeks—making a honeymoon the only other consideration. : Lisa says she fought back the tears when the surgeon rang to tell her about the procedure’s success. “I am so relieved that Paul’s surgery is complete and that he had the opportunity to be treated in this incredible way. The news that he needed this operation, after successfully undergoing chemotherapy and surgery in 2014, came completely out of the blue and we thought we would have to cancel the wedding again. “It is going to be the most special day ever and can’t wait to celebrate at the reception with our family and friends.” “This will be actually be our third attempt at getting married as COVID has played its part in us having to rearrange everything.” : Aziz Gulamhusein, consultant urological and robotic surgeon at The Christie, said: “This was a first for The Christie as we engaged our state of the art robotic equipment to aid us with the precision required for an intricate procedure as needed for Paul’s cancer.” “To be involved in such a highly specialized procedure using the latest technology is an amazing achievement for the team.” Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for metastatic testicular cancer is a commonly performed procedure at The Christie. Due to the position of these lymph nodes deep within the abdomen, the operation is traditionally done via a large open incision with the associated side effects. The Christie has one of the largest robotic centres in the UK and the aim is to use that experience and expertise to allow more patients to potentially undergo this minimally invasive surgery to treat metastatic testicular cancer. The robot offers a highly magnified, 3D view with intricate instrument dexterity to ensure careful removal of cancerous nodes whilst preserving nerves and offering an enhanced recovery with much shorter convalescence.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/couple-finally-gets-to-be-married-thanks-to-speedy-robotic-surgery/
"An early Bronze Age log coffin containing the remains of a man buried with an axe thought to date from 4,000 years ago has been discovered accidentally on a golf course. The discovery of the coffin and its contents sparked a rescue mission funded by a £70,000 ($97,000) grant from Historic England and supported by a team of staff and students from the University of Sheffield’s Department of Archaeology working nearby who offered their assistance. The coffin, which is three meters long and one meter wide, was specially protected to ensure the delicate structure did not crumble after it was exposed to the sun and air. It was made from hollowing out a tree trunk, and plants were used to cushion the body, then a gravel mound was raised over the grave; practices that were only afforded to people with a high status within Bronze Age society. The remarkable find was made by chance during works to a pond at Tetney Golf Club in July 2018, during a spell of hot weather. The golf club’s owner, Mark Casswell, was put in contact with the Portable Antiquities Scheme and Historic England. Following a year of cold storage while being assessed, it was moved to York Archaeological Trust where it has been undergoing preservation work. According to the archaeologists, the axe seems more a symbol of authority than a practical tool, while the coffin gives an insight into how social hierarchy was marked out in the early Bronze Age. So far, yew or juniper leaves have been found within the coffin and further work is planned to discover more about how plants were used in this burial practice, and the time of year the burial took place. The axe is extremely rare, there’s thought to be only 12 known from Britain, especially because the wooden shaft survives as well as the stone head. The log-coffin was originally created by carving a large, single, fast-growing oak tree. It used ‘split timber’ construction technique, where the tree trunk was split lengthways first to create a half or slightly larger log for carving, rather than hollowing out a whole tree from scratch. It probably had a lid, of which part survives. There are around 65 early Bronze Age log coffins known from Britain as it is rare for them to survive, given they are made of wood. In this case a deep layer of silt aided its preservation. However, once the coffin was exposed it was a race to prevent its rapid deterioration. Tim Allen, of Historic England, said, “The man buried at Tetney lived in a very different world to ours but like ours, it was a changing environment, rising sea levels and coastal flooding ultimately covered his grave and burial mound in a deep layer of silt that aided its preservation. Mark Casswell, owner of Tetney Golf Club, added, “My family farmed here for years before we opened the Golf Course and I’d never have imagined that there was a whole other world buried under the fields. “It’s amazing how well preserved the axe is with its handle still there like it was made yesterday. We’ll have a nice photograph of it up on the Clubhouse wall, all those years that people have been living here working the land, it’s certainly something to think about while you’re playing your way round the course.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/a-rare-bronze-age-log-coffin-found/
"The world’s biggest balloon, the size of a soccer stadium, is to be sent to the edge of space. The instrument—named Superpressure Balloon-borne Imaging Telescope, or SuperBIT—will fly above 99.5% of Earth’s atmosphere next April and will carry a wide field telescope to rival Hubble, but at a fraction of the cost. That’s according to the British scientists behind the ambitious project. SuperBIT will study dark matter, the invisible ‘glue’ that makes up 80 percent of all the stuff in the universe, which astronomers map by the way it bends rays of light, in a technique known as gravitational lensing. Professor Richard Massey of Durham University, said: “Cavemen could smash rocks together to see what they’re made of. We are going to use SuperBIT to look for the ‘crunch’ of dark matter. It is the same experiment. You just need a space telescope to see it.” A collaboration between NASA, the Canadian Space Agency, Durham, Toronto, and Princeton universities, SuperBIT cost £1.5 million ($2 million) to build compared to the £3.6 billion ($5 billion) for NASA’s Hubble. And the international team are confident SuperBIT’s high-resolution images will be just as impressive. Light from a distant galaxy can travel for billions of years before reaching our telescopes. In the final fraction of a second, it has to pass through Earth’s swirling, turbulent atmosphere—and our view of the universe becomes blurred. Observatories on the ground are built at high altitude sites to overcome some of this. But only placing a telescope in space fully escapes the effect. SuperBIT changes that. It has a mirror half a meter in diameter and is carried to an altitude of almost 25 miles (40km) by the huge helium balloon. The mission will also be much less expensive than a typical machine-based alternative, and doesn’t take as long to plan. A final test flight in 2019 demonstrated the telescope’s extraordinary pointing stability. And NASA recently developed ‘superpressure’ balloons that can contain helium for months. In April 2022, SuperBIT will take off from Wanaka on New Zealand’s South Island—carried seasonally stable winds. It will circumnavigate the Earth several times, imaging the sky all night, then using solar panels to recharge its batteries during the day. Mohamed Shaaban, a PhD student at the University of Toronto, said: “New balloon technology makes visiting space cheap, easy, and environmentally friendly. “As well as building a space telescope, our team has successfully tested all sorts of electronic and mechanical systems that could be used in future satellites.” Its relatively cheap cost could even make it possible in the future to have a fleet of space telescopes offering time to astronomers around the world. One thing the instrument will test is whether dark matter slows down during collisions. No particle colliders on Earth can accelerate dark matter. But this is a key signature predicted by theories that might explain recent observations of strange-behaving sub-atomic particles called muons.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/superbit-nasa-space-stars-balloon/

"Dark ‘eyeliner’ feathers of peregrine falcons act as sun shields to improve the birds’ hunting ability, a new scientific study suggests. Scientists have long speculated that falcons’ eye markings improve their ability to target fast-moving prey, like pigeons and doves, in bright sunlight. Now research suggests these markings have evolved according to the climate; the sunnier the bird’s habitat, the larger and darker are the tell-tale dark ‘sun-shade’ feathers. The distinctive dark stripes directly beneath the peregrine falcon’s eyes, called the malar stripe or ‘moustache’, likely reduce sunlight glare and confer a competitive advantage during high-speed chases. It’s an evolutionary trait mimicked by some top athletes who smear dark makeup below their eyes to help them spot fast-moving balls in competitive sports. Until now, there had been no scientific study linking solar radiation levels to the dark ‘eyeliner’ plumage, which is common to many other falcon species. The scientists used photos of peregrine falcons from around the world posted on the web by bird watchers and scored the size of the malar stripe for each bird. They then explored how these malar stripes varied in relation to aspects of the local climate, such as temperature, rainfall, and strength of sunlight. The study, published in the journal , was conducted by researchers from the University of Cape Town (UCT) and the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. It involved comparing malar stripe characteristics, including width and prominence, of individual peregrine falcons, by using over two thousand peregrine photographs stored in online citizen science libraries. Researchers examined samples from 94 different regions or countries. Results showed that peregrine falcon malar stripes were larger and darker in regions of the world where sunlight is stronger. “The solar glare hypothesis has become ingrained in popular literature, but has never been tested empirically before,” said Michelle Vrettos, an MSc student from UCT who carried out the research. Vrettos added: “Our results suggest that the function of the malar stripe in peregrines is best explained by this solar glare hypothesis.” Associate Professor Arjun Amar from the UCT FitzPatrick Institute, who supervised the research, said: “The peregrine falcon represents the ideal species to explore this long-standing hypothesis, because it has one of the most widespread distributions of all bird species, being present on every continent except Antarctica—it is therefore exposed to some of the brightest and some of the dullest areas around the globe.” Amar added: “We are grateful to all the photographers around the world that have deposited their photos onto websites. Without their efforts this research would not have been possible.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/falcons-natural-eye-makeup-improve-hunting-ability-cape-town/
"Australia’s largest flying reptile has been uncovered, a pterosaur that had a wingspan stretching 23 feet and soared like a dragon above the ancient inland sea that once covered the Queensland outback. University of Queensland PhD candidate Tim Richards led a research team that analyzed a fossil of the creature’s jaw. “It’s the closest thing we have to a real-life dragon,” Richards said. “The new pterosaur, which we named Thapunngaka shawi, would have been a fearsome beast, with a spear-like mouth and a wingspan around seven meters. “It was essentially just a skull with a long neck, bolted on a pair of long wings. “This thing would have been quite savage. It would have cast a great shadow over some quivering little dinosaurs who wouldn’t have heard them coming until it was too late.” Richards said the skull alone would have been just over one meter long, containing around 40 teeth. : “Even though pterosaurs could fly, they were nothing like birds, or even bats,” he said. “Pterosaurs were the very first back-boned animals to take a stab at powered flight.” A reptile species in the group, these pterosaurs were perfectly adapted to powered flight because of their thin-walled, hollow bones—making their fossilized remains very rare and often poorly-preserved. “It’s quite amazing (that) fossils of these animals exist at all,” Richards said. Dr. Steve Salisbury, co-author of the paper published in the , noted what was particularly striking about this new species of anhanguerian: the massive size of the bony crest on its lower jaw, which it presumably had on its upper jaw as well. The fossil was found in a quarry by a local man, Len Shaw, who has been ‘scratching around’ in the area for decades. The name of the new species honors the First Nations peoples of the area, incorporating words from the now-extinct language of the Wanamara Nation. “The genus name, Thapunngaka, incorporates thapun [ta-boon] and ngaka [nga-ga], the Wanamara words for ‘spear’ and ‘mouth’, respectively,” Dr Salisbury said. “The species name, shawi, honours the fossil’s discoverer Len Shaw, so the name means ‘Shaw’s spear mouth’.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/university-queensland-dinosaur-discovery/
"A dream deferred doesn’t necessarily mean a dream denied, even if it takes seven decades to come true. In 1952, Martha and Lehman Tucker became man and wife. Although the marriage was a true romance, the wedding was missing one element the bride would have dearly loved to have—a traditional white lace wedding gown. But in those days, Martha was unable to make the purchase in the racially segregated bridal shops of Birmingham, Alabama. For years, Martha kept those memories to herself, but recently the 94-year-old revealed her long-held hopes to her granddaughter, Angela Strozier. Knowing the sacrifices the Black women of Martha’s generation faced day-to-day—being denied many of life’s customs, courtesies, and basic rights that others simply took for granted—Strozier decided it was time to make her grandmother’s wedding dress wish come true. This past July, after a fortifying brunch and a preparatory makeup session, the bridal party made their way to David’s Bridal in Hoover, Alabama, where the wedding gown Martha had always dreamed of—complete with full-length lace sleeves, matching veil, and even a cheeky, charming thigh-high lace garter—awaited her. “When I first put on that dress, I was just so very excited,” Martha told . “It was like I was getting married all over again. When I saw myself in the mirror, I was shocked. I said to myself, ‘Who is that?’ I can’t even explain the feeling I got seeing myself in the wedding dress.” “Happy doesn’t really paint the picture of how this made me feel,” Strozier added. “My grandma has always been a giver, so to be able to finally give her an experience so dear to her was priceless. Happy is an understatement.” Sadly, Lehman Tucker passed away in 1975. On the day she married him, Martha promised herself that one day, she’d wear the dress worthy of those vows. Although it took her 70 years, it’s a promise she kept—and if there is an afterlife, we’re sure her beloved groom was smiling down on his beautiful bride when she finally did.

"Across the country, soft, cushiony moss could be the cure to the struggling homeowner’s case of a balding lawn. Growing faster, more easily, and with less effort than normal grass, it has been the landscaper’s choice in Japan for centuries. If one is struggling with patchy, dry, or weed-ridden grass lawns, it could be the moment to throw in the towel with a plant that in reality is quite fragile, almost always non-native, and offers little to the environment or the animals that live in the area. Moss gardens and moss lawns are becoming more and more popular in the United States. In so many ways, moss is superior to any species of grass—except perhaps for the purpose of serving as a volleyball court or soccer pitch. Moss grows fast, and is difficult to kill after it takes hold, and while psychologists note that green is a color that induces positive emotions, there’s no shade of green more vibrant or powerful than moist emerald moss. that are perfect for sun, growing in between stepping stones, others which can climb over rocks or other objects, and carpet-like, or even edible moss. If you have an area of bare or patchy lawn or earth, clear it of as much grass, leaves, and debris as you can until you have a firm soil bed. Next, lightly rake the top level of dirt and press the pieces of moss down firmly onto it. If the moss pieces seem dry, soak them in water for a few minutes before laying them down. After watering thoroughly, it should be 4-6 weeks for the moss to completely take hold, after which regular watering during dry summers is all one needs do—which leads to the next major benefit of a moss lawn or garden: the lack of maintenance needed. to the sheer volume of searches online for how to moss, a testament, she says, to its resilience even in the face of determined anthropogenic attack. However moss grows well in sun and shade, and doesn’t need water any more often than normal grass does—and often needs much less. Furthermore, moss grows about four inches high at most, meaning the lawnmower can look for employment elsewhere, and it never needs fertilizer. The only thing one must look for are signs of weeds poking up between the moss patches; they must be removed by hand as moss is not immune to herbicide. And leaves must be cleared if they fall on the moss in autumn, as they can cause the moss underneath to rot. Moss lawns can be expensive compared to grass seed, but expect to save way more in associated costs down the line. In any case, rights permitting, to whichever nearby forest in which they know moss grows, and pull up strips or patches, and repeat the steps needed to fasten the moss to its new habitat. Traditional moss gardens and lawns are paired to stone gardens, water gardens, and flower or herb gardens to create serene beauty, and tranquil stillness, as the tradition for Zen gardening has done for centuries. America has a long history of adopting aspects of Japanese culture, and it’s about time we did the same with moss gardens.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/benefits-of-growing-a-moss-garden-or-lawn/

"Art Garfunkel once described his legendary musical chemistry with Paul Simon, “We meet somewhere in the air through the vocal cords… .” But a new study of duetting songbirds from Ecuador has offered another tune explaining the mysterious connection between successful performing duos. It’s a link of their minds, and it happens, in fact, as each singer mutes the brain of the other as they coordinate their duets. In a study, a team of researchers studying brain activity of singing male and female plain-tailed wrens has discovered that the species synchronizes their frenetically paced duets, surprisingly, by inhibiting the song-making regions of their partner’s brain as they exchange phrases. Researchers say that the auditory feedback exchanged between wrens during their opera-like duets momentarily inhibits motor circuits used for singing in the listening partner, which helps link the pair’s brains and coordinate turn-taking for a seemingly telepathic performance. The study also offers fresh insight into how humans and other cooperative animals use sensory cues to act in concert with one another. “You could say that timing is everything,” said Eric Fortune, co-author of the study and neurobiologist at New Jersey Institute of Technology’s Department of Biological Sciences. “What these wrens have shown us is that for any good collaboration, partners need to become ‘one’ through sensory linkages. The take-home message is that when we are cooperating well… we become a single entity with our partners.” “Think of these birds like jazz singers,” added Melissa Coleman, the paper’s corresponding author and associate professor of biology at Scripps College. “Duetting wrens have a rough song structure planned before they sing, but as the song evolves, they must rapidly coordinate by receiving constant input from their counterpart. “What we expected to find was a highly active set of specialized neurons that coordinate this turn-taking, but instead what we found is that hearing each other actually causes inhibition of those neurons—that’s the key regulating the incredible timing between the two.” For the study, the team had to travel to the heart of the plain-tail wren music scene, within remote bamboo forests on the slopes of Ecuador’s active Antisana Volcano. Camped at the Yanayacu Biological Station’s lab, the team made neurophysiological recordings of four pairs of native wrens as they sang solo and duet songs, analyzing sensorimotor activity in a premotor area of the birds’ brains where specialized neurons for learning and making music are active. The recordings showed that during duet turn-taking—which often take the form of tightly knit call-and-answer phrases, or syllables, that together sound as if a single bird is singing—the birds’ neurons fired rapidly when they produced their own syllables. Yet, as one wren begins to hear their partner’s syllables sung in the duet, the neurons quiet down significantly. “You can think of inhibition as acting like a trampoline,” explained Fortune. “When the birds hear their partner, the neurons are inhibited, but just like rebounding off a trampoline, the release from that inhibition causes them to swiftly respond when it’s their time to sing.” Next, the team played recordings of wrens duetting while they were in a sleep-like state, anesthetized with a drug that affects a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the wrens’ brains that is also found in humans, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The drug transformed the activity in the brain, from inhibition to bursts of activity when the wrens heard their own music. “These mechanisms are shared or similar to what happens in our brains because we are doing the same kind of things,” said Fortune, whose study has been published in . “There are similar brain circuits in humans that are involved in learning and coordinating vocalizations.” Fortune and Coleman say the results offer a fresh look into how the brains of humans and other cooperating animals use sensory cues to act in concert with each other, from flowing musical and dance performances, or even the disjointed feeling of inhibition commonly experienced today during video conferencing.

"Cozying up in a warm fleece blanket after a day on the slopes is a lovely feeling; cozying the slopes up in a fleece blanket, as it turns out, can also be an excellent way to keep snow and ice from melting high in the Swiss Alps. While making something cozy under a blanket isn’t exactly how one would first think to keep something cold, it’s protecting Switzerland’s vulnerable glaciers from the summer sun by reflecting the rays away . The 3,238-meter (10,623-ft) Mount Titlis has seen large portions of its glacial coverage disappear over the last few decades, and ski resort employees who rely on the glaciers to keep the snow thick and crisp for winter holidays work for 4-6 weeks securing blankets to give the ice rivers all the help they can get.

The law of the was passed way back in the 20th century, and protected —beech, oak, pine, olive, cypress—from harm. The 1939 law described monumental trees as “immovable things that have remarkable characteristics of natural beauty,” which as Elisabetta Zavoli writing for explains, gave a visual emphasis on what was already a vague categorization for the law. One of the most important aspects of monumental trees is not their beauty, but their effect as micro-ecosystems. Their hollows, scars, dead branches, and living ones all play host to a wide variety of species like insects, mushrooms, birds, and small rodents. Signs of damage or decay, while hardly being pleasing on the eye, provide vital nutrients and shelter for the forest animals, such that in 2013 a better, more representational definition of a monumental tree was passed into Italian law. It’s a good thing too, as many of the monumental trees Zavoli highlights didn’t become monumental for their beauty, but for their age. The olive tree in the village of Villastrada in Umbria could be 2,500 years old, but it isn’t exactly a looker. Its principal trunk has long since decayed, and other younger trunks have grown over its lifespan. Another example is the Pontone beech tree in Abruzzo, which is actually seven beech trees fused together, wrapped in the same layer of bark. Since 2013, over 3,000 new entries have joined the national monumental tree registry. Some are treasured for their beauty, others for their age; yet more are valued for the legend and myth surrounding their lives. The 800-year-old Cypress of Saint Francis is said to have been planted when, returning from a walk, Saint Francis of Assisi tried to burn the walking stick he had just used. When it failed to catch fire, he decided to plant it instead, allegedly saying “If you do not want to burn, grow up!” The cones that fall every year from that tree, located in a convent, are gathered in the hopes that pilgrims who can manage to grow something from its seeds will have a blessed tree.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-25000-monumental-trees-of-italy-are-old-habitats-shrouded-in-legend/
"On the 6th of September, the Mars Rover drilled down into a briefcase-sized rock with its incredibly sophisticated sample and capture system, and then took a photo to commemorate the first Martian rock retrieved as part of its mission. After a brief confusion, scientists and space enthusiasts finally saw the photo that conclusively showed a Mars rock captured in the sample tube, and were able to celebrate a truly historic moment. Two days later into the same rock and captured another sample. Perseverance is exploring the bottom of an ancient lake bed known as Jezero Crater, where scientists believe the remains of ancient microbial life on Mars, should there be any, will be found. “NASA has a history of setting ambitious goals and then accomplishing them, reflecting our nation’s commitment to discovery and innovation,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “This is a momentous achievement and I can’t wait to see the incredible discoveries produced by Perseverance and our team.” : An August 7th attempt at drilling into the Martian regolith , worrying scientists that their billion-dollar rover had flown the entire 3.5 years to Mars to return empty-handed. “I have been on every Mars rover mission since the beginning, and this planet is always teaching us what we don’t know about it,” said the project manager for Perseverance, Jennifer Trosper. “One thing I’ve found is, it’s not unusual to have complications during complex, first-time activities.” We know there was an atmosphere and water on Mars billions of years ago, and if those conditions had remained long enough, there’s a chance life could regenerate itself. The next stop after gathering samples of Jezero will be the ancient lake’s fan-shaped delta, a class of landscape where life would explode with diversity and prosperity—at least on Earth. It holds one of the best chances we’ll have for finding microbial lifeforms. The delta could potentially contain clay, which rapidly entombs organic material. If there is any clay, there might be remains of life. : Another opportunity will be the carbonate rocks, which have been located in Jezero using Mars orbiter data, and which on Earth to exquisitely preserve organic structures such as seashells. Perseverance is planned to study the geography of Mars as it travels along for a year or two, before depositing its samples back at the landing site, where a fetch rover, which could launch as early as 2026, will have to retrieve them. It’s agonizing to think we are reporting on the collection of these samples now, but may have to wait 10 years for them to arrive back on Earth.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/mars-rover-grabs-first-rock-sample-a-truly-historic-moment/

"Our partner Rob Brezsny provides his weekly wisdom to enlighten our thinking and motivate our mood. Rob’s , is a syndicated weekly column appearing in over a hundred publications. He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): “There’s nothing wrong with reading a book you love over and over,” writes Virgo author . Adding to that encouragement, I offer you the following authorizations: There’s nothing wrong with seeking a pleasure you love over and over; or doing a necessary task you love over and over; or performing an energizing ritual you love over and over; or expressing key truths you love over and over. And these permissions will be especially crucial for you to exult in during the coming weeks, dear Virgo: because it’s a time when mindful repetition will be one of your strengths and a key to stimulating the deepening experiences you need. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): “If I’m a bitch and a fake. Is there nobody who will love a bitch and a fake?” Libra author wrote that in his novel . Here’s my extrapolation: I believe that every one of us, including me, is a bitch and a fake now and then. We all go through periods when we are not at our best, when we fail to live up to our own high standards. Is it possible that you have recently flirted with such a phase? If so, the cosmos has authorized me to absolve you. You are free to reclaim your full exquisite beauty. And if you haven’t been a bitch and a fake, congratulations. It means you have weathered a gnarly storm. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Poet Yves Olade writes, “I’ve started thinking of people as wounds that don’t heal.” To me, that idea is idiotically cynical. Moreover, I think it’s wrong for most of us. The truth is, humans have a natural instinct for healing. They are predisposed to attract experiences that might aid their recovery from difficulties—that might teach them the healing lessons they need. I believe this will be especially true for you in the coming weeks. (PS: writes, “Any level of biological organization that we examine, from DNA up to the most complex body systems, shows the capacity for self-diagnosis, for removal of damaged structure, and for regeneration of new structure.”) SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Research suggests that most people think everyone else has more fun than they do. But I’m guessing that only a small percentage of Sagittarians feel that way. You tend to be extra alert for fun, and you have intuitive skill at tracking down fun. In addition, you often take the initiative to precipitate fun. You understand you have a responsibility to generate fun, and you have a talent for generating it. All these capacities will serve you well in the coming weeks. I recommend you raise your mastery of the art and science of having fun to a new level. Be the Champion of Fun and Games for your entire circle. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): I’m not engaging in empty flattery when I say that you are unlike anyone else who has ever lived in the history of the world. Your absolute uniqueness is a fundamental fact. Maybe you don’t reflect on this truth very often. Perhaps you feel that it’s not helpful to think about or that it’s irrelevant to your daily decision-making. But I propose that in the next three weeks, you give it a central place in your understanding of your destiny. Allow it to influence everything you do. Make it a major factor in your decision-making. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Welcome back from the underworld, Aquarius. I hope your time wandering through the maze-like twilight brought you as many fascinating mysteries as confusing questions. I trust you took advantage of the smoky riddles and arresting dilemmas to fortify your soul’s wisdom. I suspect that although your travels may have at times seemed hard to fathom, they have provided you with a superb education that will serve you well in the immediate future. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): In ‘s novel , the lead character says to a friend, “You filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life.” Is there a person who might inspire you like that, Pisces? Maybe a person from your past with whom you’ve fallen out of touch? Or is there a person hovering on the outskirts of your life who could stimulate you to have such feelings? Now is a favorable time to seek these influences. I advise you to be bold in your quest to associate with allies who will stimulate your lust for life and teach you crucial lessons. (PS: For extra credit, make abundant use of another theme from Wilde’s book: “The search for beauty is the real secret of life.”) ARIES (March 21-April 19): “Books are mirrors: You only see in them what you already have inside you,” wrote author . Let’s take that a step further: “Other people are mirrors: You only see in them what you already have inside you.” And even further. “The whole world is a mirror: You only see in it what you already have inside you.” Have fun playing with these meditations, Aries. The coming weeks will be a fertile time to explore how thoroughly your experiences reflect the activity transpiring in your own brain. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Some spiritual teachers say things like “I am not my body” or “This body is not me.” I don’t understand that. It’s an insult and disparagement. It’s dismissive of our bodies’ sublime beauty and our bodies’ inspired role in educating our souls. I agree that we are not ONLY our bodies. I agree that a part of us is eternal, not confined to flesh and blood. But hell yes, I am my body. You are your body. It’s a glorious aspect of who we are. It’s a miraculous creation that has taken millions of years to evolve into the masterpiece it is. So yes, you are your body, and yes, this body is you. I hope you love your body. Are in awe of it. Are pleased to be inside it. If anything is lacking in this department, now is an excellent time to make corrections. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): “I know someone who kisses the way a flower opens,” wrote poet . I’d love for you Geminis to have that experience. The astrological omens suggest it’s more likely than usual to occur sometime soon. Other experiences with a better-than-average chance of unfolding in the coming days: allies who speak of intimate subjects in ways that resemble a flower opening; partners who co-create with you in ways that resemble a flower opening; spiritual helpers who offer guidance and help in ways that resemble a flower opening. CANCER (June 21-July 22): “I lie to myself all the time, but I never believe me,” writes Cancerian author . Ha! As a Cancerian myself, I confess to the same crime. But I am looking forward to a shift in the coming weeks. I suspect we Crabs will be inspired to cut way back on the fibs we try to get away with. You know what that means, right? We’ll be more inclined to trust ourselves, since we’ll be more likely to tell ourselves the truth. Our decisions will be shrewd, and our self-care will be rigorous. Hallelujah! LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): My object in this is to stimulate your imagination in ways nobody else in your life will. You need an influence like me, from outside your inner circle, to administer friendly, playful shocks to jolt you out of habitual ways of thinking. Here we go. 1. If you were to stow seven parts of your soul in seven objects, what objects would they be? 2. If you could change one thing about your past, what would it be? 3. If you were a character in a fairy tale or a movie, who would you be? 4. If you could travel to a place that would teach you what you most need to know, where would it be? 5. If you had a magical animal as your special ally, what animal would it be? 6. If you could sing a song with uncanny healing power for someone you care about, what song would it be? 7.

"Have you ever wanted to live on a farm, but without having to do all the hard work or needing to drive an hour to reach a major city? In San Francisco, a mixed-income apartment complex has gone up in the neighborhood of Santa Clara that comes with its own 1.5 acre farm, managed by a professional urban farming company, which also welcomes help from residents. The Agrihood building consists of 361 units, 181 of which are priced below market rate— 10% are reserved for moderate income renters, and 165 for low-income seniors and veterans. The complex also contains 30 townhomes and features a central 1.5 acre organic farm that can produce 20,000 pounds of food every year. Each week the produce is brought to an on-site location and sold at a deep discount for residents. The full list of produce is , and includes superfoods, comfort foods, orchards, perennial foods, and native foods. “Our goal throughout this endeavor has been to provide the affordable housing that we urgently need in Santa Clara through a truly creative, community-driven process,” writes the brochure. : “Not only are we providing a really unique living experience for the residents that live on the property, but we’re also taking a very deliberate approach to encouraging the health and wellness of our residents by incorporating the farm, hopefully, into their daily and weekly lifestyles,” Vince Cantore, who is vice-president of Core Companies, the firm leading the Agrihood project, told . Attempting to address the housing shortage in San Francisco, Agrihood is actually built on the site of what used to be one of the many orchards that covered Santa Clara in decades past. : Urban farming and gardening is growing in popularity, with some cities, parks, or neighborhoods attempting to include community gardens, , or into development plans.

With thousands of additional satellites slated for placement around the Earth as part of future plans for universal internet connectivity, the job to tackle the growing orbital refuse must fall to someone. The company, called Privateer Space, has nothing to do with piracy, and is in fact in “stealth mode,” and as such we know little about it. Steve Wozniak, an Apple co-founder of the I software, who has a net worth of $100 million, tweeted out a link to the which currently has nothing but a YouTube video on it.

"A research team at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences has identified a potential cause of long-lasting symptoms experienced by COVID-19 patients, often referred to as ‘long-haulers’. At the heart of the team’s findings is an antibody that shows up weeks after an initial infection and attacks and disrupts a key regulator of the immune system, said lead researcher John Arthur, M.D., Ph.D., professor and chief of the Division of Nephrology in the UAMS College of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine. As many as 30% of COVID-19 patients experience lingering fatigue, brain fog and shortness of breath. The cause of long COVID-19 has eluded scientists, but the UAMS team’s discovery sheds important new light on the molecular-level mechanisms behind it. “Everything that we’ve found is consistent with this antibody as the instigator of long COVID, so it’s an exciting development,” Dr. Arthur said. The antibody creates problems for the immune system by attacking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The ACE2 enzyme helps regulate the body’s response to the virus by metabolizing a peptide that activates the immune system. The attacking antibody interferes with ACE2’s work, which makes the antibody a prime suspect for the long-lasting illness. : The multidisciplinary research team was brought together quickly this spring to test the hypothesis that developed through discussions between Arthur and UAMS’ Terry Harville, M.D., Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Pathology and medical director of the Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Laboratories. Researchers tested plasma or serum for ACE2 antibodies in 67 patients in Arkansas and Oklahoma with known SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and 13 with no history of infection. In 81% of blood samples from patients with a history of COVID-19, the samples had the antibody that attacked the ACE2. In participants with no history of COVID-19, no antibodies were created to attack the ACE2 enzyme. “If we show that the whole hypothesis is right, that this interference of ACE2 really does cause long COVID, then it opens up many potential treatments,” . “There are medications that should work to treat them.” : The next step would be to test the drugs that might relieve the symptoms people are having.

"Rather than give in to depression, one man chose to fight back in a way that not only changed his own life for the better—it gave a stranger he’d never met a second chance as well. Gage Tappe had recently moved to Idaho and had part-time custody of one of his kids. Alone and isolated, he admits he was at an “all-time low.” Looking for something to help him cope with his sadness and feel more connected, Tappe signed up as a donor with the national bone marrow registry. “I felt like my life wasn’t worth very much, so I hoped that I gave myself a chance to put some value to my own life by trying to help somebody extend theirs and continuing to stay on the list… and you have to be alive to do that,” Tappe correspondent Carson Daly. “It gave me a sense of value to myself that I didn’t previously have.” Several months later, Tappe got a call to let him know he’d been identified as a match. Tappe says since he was raised to help others in need, in any way big or small, he just needed to know where and when his marrow could be harvested for the transplant. The donation was made anonymously. The identity of the recipient didn’t matter to Tappe, the only thing he cared about was being able to have a meaningful and positive impact on someone’s life—but neither he nor the woman his bone marrow was going to could know just how life-changing his donation would turn out to be. By the time Tia Jensen was diagnosed with leukemia in 2018, she’d already been dealing with the effects of multiple sclerosis for two decades. For this latest health hurdle, she started a course of chemotherapy at the Seattle Cancer Center Alliance and added her name to the waiting list for a bone marrow donor. After the successful transplant procedure, Jensen was stunned to learn that not only had her leukemia gone into remission, but thanks to her newly revitalized immune system, the multiple sclerosis she’d been battling for 20 years was in remission as well. Ecstatic, Jensen wanted to reach out and thank her donor. Two years and many letters later, Jensen was eventually given Tappe’s contact information and the two struck up a correspondence. Though delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, they finally met in person on the set of The TODAY Show. “I have been wanting to meet [him] for so long… I missed meeting Gage because of the pandemic. And I realized that because of Gage, there’s a lot of milestones that I won’t miss. I’m alive. I’m here. I’m going to get to be with my family, to be in the memories,” Jensen told TODAY’S Sheinelle Jones. A grateful Jensen sees Tappe as a true role model. To honor him, and so that more patients might enjoy recovery stories with similar happy outcomes, Jensen has teamed up with for an online donor registration event in hopes of inspiring others to follow his example of getting tested and stepping up to donate if and when they’re matched. She has high hopes for the initiative. “I think we forget too often how kind and big-hearted people are. And I am so grateful that [Gage] was willing to just be brave and take that step and share this kindness and marrow and give me a second chance at life,” she told Daly. “All this was done not knowing a thing about me, and I am just floored by the charity and the beauty in that.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/man-gives-bone-marrow-depression-ms-goes-gage-tappe/
"12-year-old Wanessa Bąkowska has been pouring her sensitivity through paints and onto canvas since she adopted as a little girl with Down syndrome. From Lipka, Poland, the 6th grade student has also been enchanted with all things royal, and recently decided to make a painting for the queen. With her tutor’s help in translating to English, she wrote a letter and sent it off to the palace: “Your Majesty, my name is Wanessa and I am 12 years old. I live in Poland, in the small town of Lipka. “I have wonderful teachers and many friends. I have mum Karolina, dad Rafał, brother Alan and sister Nutka. I love them very much. “I am a person with a disability and Down Syndrome. Nevertheless, I paint pictures. I would like to give you one of them, Your Majesty. The title of this painting is ‘Earth’. Greetings from Poland.” She posted on Facebook about sending the painting, saying in Polish: “I like breaking stereotypes and I like to pretend to myself that the impossible doesn’t exist… Although in real life I will not have such an opportunity, I visited the royal court through a letter I wrote to Queen Elizabeth… Beloved dreams are there to make them come true, even if they seem unreal.” : Well, the ‘unreal’ did come true on September 6, as they received a reply from the royal court in their mailbox. The Queen’s response, dictated by an assistant, spoke of how ‘touched’ she was with the effort she put into the painting, describing it as “splendid”. : The letter said Her Majesty was thankful to the 12-year-old for her “thoughtfulness for taking the time to write” and wished her success in the future. Pictures of the official reply was posted to her daughter’s with the words, “Dreams are made to be fulfilled. Today I got a reply to my letter from Queen Elizabeth.” Her mom shares the canvases from her talented young daughter to social media at ‘Pictures Painted With Heart’ ( ), which has over 2000 followers. There you can see details about how Wanessa uses every day objects, like plastic cups, balloons, beads, and plastic wrap, to move paint in unique and ethereal ways. She’s creating more complex and beautiful works every week. In fact, the Labirynt gallery in Pila hosted an exhibition of her works and one of her paintings was even shown in the National Theatre in Warsaw last year. “We didn’t expect an answer. Nobody was set on it,” Karolina Bąkowska told the Polish news outlet, Fakt. “Regardless of whether the lady of the court responded to it on behalf of the queen, or someone else, it was a huge surprise for us, and above all for Wanessa.” :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/polish-artist-with-down-syndrome-gets-note-from-queen/
"As a little boy, Nick Priest loved playing video games with his dad, Joe, who was a wiz at all things tech and gaming. They started off with Nick holding a controller and pretending to play, and moved on to Lego games and Mario Galaxy. Joe was diagnosed with cancer when Nick was three, and after that, they played more than ever. The last time he made it down to the basement for gaming, Joe was so weak that he couldn’t even walk—he had to go down the stairs, step by step, on his rear end—but it was worth it and the pair had a blast. When he passed away, Nick was just six, but the boy didn’t just lose his dad, he lost his gaming partner. When friends or family would visit and play with him, it took his mind off his sadness and brought back happy memories of playing. Nick told his mom then that no kid should ever be without someone to play video games with. That’s when the was born. He started working on the project as a freshman in high school, at Salesianum School Wilmington, Delaware. Now a junior, he rallies teens to bring the “power of play” (particularly video games) to kids who are affected by cancer or other illnesses At first, Nick recruited volunteers to go to the local children’s hospital, Alfred I. Dupont Hospital for Children, to play games with kids one-on-one. Then COVID-19 hit, making in-person events impossible. Determined to keep going, he raised $1,000 that he used to buy 2 Playstation 4 gaming systems and a few controllers. Then, he interviewed a girl who had gone through childhood cancer and her mom, and they told him how isolating and lonely cancer treatment can be, even before COVID. Nick learned that kids in treatment are often unable to leave their rooms or are in isolation rooms, meaning even if there were a gaming system to play, there wasn’t anyone to play with. And although most of these young patients have phones and tablets, they usually aren’t allowed to use the hospital’s WIFI to link up with each other to stream and play. : He brainstormed to find a way his volunteers could play with kids online and a way that kids in the hospital could play with each other. He told hospital officials about his idea, and together, they developed a system where the kids on a floor can communicate with each other while playing. “Hospitals have a lot of privacy laws and regulations,” Nick told GNN, “It took a long time but we finally got there!” “No, video games do not cure any disease, but as my dad always used to say, ‘Laughter is the best medicine!’” : The team also helps those who have parents or siblings that are going through something tough. Realizing that there were kids who weren’t in the hospital but still could benefit from playing video games, Nick and his NPOP volunteers developed a Buddy System. Parents reach out to NPOP and share the games their child likes and other interests, and then Nick assigns one of his teen volunteers—like Kylie or Jack who are both officers in the project (pictured above)—to be a buddy, based on their interests. For example, he buddied up a kid who loved football with a varsity football player. : The kids and their buddies decide how often and when to play, but usually it is once every week or so. They log in and compete with each other and talk, just connecting and having fun. The kids and buddies are really enjoying it, so NPOP really wants to expand and reach as many kids as they can. Currently, they have more volunteers than kids who want to play, because so many teens want to help. Nick asked GNN to encourage readers to reach out, if they have a child or teen who could benefit from a gaming buddy, and to spread the word to anyone who NPOP may be able to help. NPOP’s website is and from there, parents can email and get the buddy process started. “If I can bring smiles to children’s faces, and bring laughter into their hospital rooms, I will do whatever it takes to make that happen.” : Nick told GNN that he is “very close” to getting his 501c3 nonprofit finalized, but he did set up a for anyone who wishes to contribute to the purchase of more controllers and gaming systems.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/teens-bring-power-of-play-to-kids-in-hospital/
"In order to cut back on the conflicts between humans and elephants, Chinese wildlife authorities have constructed a massive “food court” along established elephant migratory routes. Stocked with five salty ponds, and many different kinds of plants that can satisfy their dietary needs, the elephant food court of Jinghong Nature Reserve spans 670,000 square meters, the same size as Porche’s Stuttgart car assembly plant, or around 62 European football fields. Elephants roam vast distances every year, whether they live in China, India, or Africa. They have no concept of land ownership or borders, and can often bring economic ruin to any unlucky farmer whose fields are close at hand when an elephant determines it’s time for lunch. Since the end of the last century, Asian elephants in Jinghong have enjoyed protected status, and in number from 85 to 185. This has led to greater conflict with locals during migrations. The food court was started last December and finished in May, and its position in a national forest reserve was cleverly selected to ensure they would pass it every year during migration. The “food base,” or “dining hall” as Cha Wei, deputy director of Jinghong Reserve, described it is meant to eliminate the need for the pachyderms to raid nearby farms. “If provided with enough food, the elephants will not break into villages and croplands to forage, which can help resolve conflicts between local people and wild elephants,” Mr. Cha was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency. Last year 14 elephants trekked 500 kilometers during a migratory period that lasted 17 months, They’ve now returned to their traditional habitat of Mojiang County in Yunnan where all, including a calf born along the way, are stable and accounted for.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/670000-square-meter-dining-hall-built-for-elephants-in-jinghong-to-stop-conflict-with-humans/
"There’s never been an insult to convey a greater misconception than the phrase ‘bird-brained’, because our feathered friends routinely use their high levels of intelligence, and soar to surprising heights demanding admiration. Take Bruce for example, the 8 year-old Alpine parrot from New Zealand. Bruce is missing the top half of his beak and is considered disabled, but that doesn’t stop him from doing all the things a normal parrot does. He has adapted to use his tongue in place of the missing upper beak to lift tools, and, most notably, to grasp a pebble to clean dust and mites from between his feathers—something never before observed in the species. Alpine Kea are the world’s only alpine-dwelling parrots, and they’ve been known to be ‘bird-brained’ in this new sense. They’re very pensive, and have even been shown to weigh up probabilities before making a decision. : Bruce was found at Arthur’s Pass on the South Island in 2013 when he was a juvenile. Scientists at the South Island wildlife hospital assume he lost his beak during an encounter with a pest trap. Now housed at the Willowbank Wildlife Reserve, he was first observed using a pebble in lieu of his beak for preening purposes back in 2019, a behavior so extraordinary that a group of scientists set out to observe him. They that in 90% of instances where he grabbed a pebble, he used it to preen himself, which constitutes tool usage in animals. In 95% of instances when a pebble was dropped, he retrieved or replaced it to continue grooming himself, seriously ruling out the ‘fooling around behavior’ . Amalia Bastos had the fortune of observing this “big personality” for the research, and she about the experience. “Because Bruce’s behavior is consistent and repeated, it is regarded as intentional and innovative,” Bastos said. “It is Bruce’s own unique tool-use, and this is the first scientific observation of that.” : “He’ll pick up a piece of carrot and push it against a hard piece of metal or rock and use that to scrape with his lower bill, which again is a feeding behavior we haven’t seen in the other birds.” The green and red birds have been documented to use sticks to clean themselves before, but lacking the dexterity the rest of his beak would have afforded him, Bruce has had to make do. : SEE it in action in the video below… (NOTE: Audio is only music so feel free to mute.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/disabled-parrot-cleans-himself-using-pebbles/
"Leaded gas, one of our species’ great pollutants, is no longer made or used. The last country which sold leaded gasoline, Algeria, ceased to do so this month, 41 years after the first country—Japan—made the decision. It was in the early days of the automobile’s ascension that gasoline producers began to add different chemicals to prevent damage to the interiors of their engines. Lead quickly began to represent the superior choice, which over the next 80 years was shot out through the exhaust pipes of cars around the world. U.S. researchers of lead’s toxic effects by the time the EPA was created in 1973, at which time the U.S. began a 25-year phase out. Japan only needed seven years following those initial reports to ban leaded gas, with Austria, Canada, Slovakia, Denmark, and Sweden following shortly after. The U.S. and UK finally removed leaded gas in the late ’90s, after which most countries followed. “The elimination of lead from gas is one of the great environmental achievements of all time,” Carol Browner, administrator of the EPA . “Thousands of tons of lead have been removed from the air, and blood levels of lead in our children are down 70 percent. This means that millions of children will be spared the painful consequences of lead poisoning, such as permanent nerve damage, anemia or mental retardation.” Indeed the global ban is projected to prevent 1.2 million premature deaths worldwide, and save a total of $2.4 trillion in medical costs for treating lead poisoning, which can damage pretty much every major system in the human body. A detailed summary of the leaded-gas story, , claims it took 10 years after the turn of the millennium to convince 107 countries to ban it, but 10 more years to convince the holdouts. By 2016, only the war-ravaged nations of Iraq and Yemen, and the last major exporter, Algeria, were left. “The successful enforcement of the ban on leaded petrol is a huge milestone for global health and our environment,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN environment program. “Overcoming a century of deaths and illnesses that affected hundreds of millions and degraded the environment worldwide, we are invigorated to change humanity’s trajectory for the better through an accelerated transition to clean vehicles and electric mobility.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/after-four-decades-of-advocacy-all-the-world-bans-leaded-gasoline/
"In response to global warming concerns across the planet, the world’s largest beef exporter has approved the sale of a feed additive that cuts methane emissions from beef and dairy cattle. Regulators in Brazil and Chile have granted full market authorization for Royal DSM’s Bovaer to be given to cows as well as sheep and goats, the company said recently in a statement. The methane-reducing additive obtained this first approval after a 10-year collaboration called Project Clean Cow, and its success in on farms in 13 countries across 4 continents—peer-reviewed studies (such as at UC Davis) that were published in scientific journals “A beef trial with Bovaer at Sao Paolo State University (UNESP) in Brazil conducted in 2016-2017, showed enteric methane emission reductions up to 55%, which highlights the potential for radically more sustainable cattle farming in Latin America to further lower their carbon footprint,” said Mauricio Adade, president DSM Latin America. : And the additive comes “without adverse effects on performance”, says São Paulo State University Professor Ricardo Reis. ”The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) stated that a rapid reduction of methane emissions could reduce the spread of global warming in the near term and have a positive effect on air quality,” s Mark van Nieuwland. “We know the agricultural and livestock sectors recognize this opportunity for change and are eager to act.” Just a quarter teaspoon of Bovaer per cow per day consistently reduces burped methane emission by approximately 30% for dairy cows and even higher percentages (up till 90%) for beef cows. After suppressing methane production in the stomach, it is broken down into compounds already naturally present in the cow’s stomach. :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bovaer-approved-for-feed-additive-in-brazil-chile/
"Car manufacturer Nissan employs a member of staff who has ‘enhanced senses’—to ensure its products have the all-important ‘new car smell’. Peter Karl Eastland has a master’s degree in chemistry and forensic science from Leicester University. But he also possesses an extremely acute sense of smell, a gift he realized he had from an early age, which allows him to identify more than 15 smell categories. Nissan recognized he has the ‘nose for the job’ and appointed him as the ‘odor evaluation lead engineer’ at its European Technical Centre in Bedfordshire. His job is to ensure the consumer experience in the new Qashqai model isn’t compromised by any unappealing odors. Peter, dubbed the ‘Nose of Nissan’, said: “I remember as a young kid playing games where we had to identify different food stuffs, like flavours of crisps [chips], sweets, or drinks by their smell alone. “I was able to correctly identify the difference between the own-brand supermarket items and the leading brands’ products, even when the flavor was meant to be the same. “At Nissan, I work with a lot of different materials, for example polymers, rubbers, and adhesives. “Having a trained nose means that I can tell the difference between fake and real leather, or cloth and fabric. “We aim to provide the best sensory experience for the customer. While tastes and preferences evolve over time, smell remains a constant. “Therefore, it is part of our job to make sure that any material we use is always going to be perfect in terms of odor and that all of the senses are harmonized.” Liaising with the Nissan engineering and manufacturing teams, Peter and his team test all the materials, such as the soft material used for the new 3D diamond quilted seats in a variety of conditions to replicate real-world environments. They have to consider that the chemical properties of these materials, such as odor, can change according to temperature. Where a potential new material or chemical is found to negatively affect the overall cabin ambience, Peter and his colleagues will identify alternatives to ensure the ‘sanctity’ of the new-car smell. The evaluation process blends objective and subjective assessment, culminating in a rigorous process that leaves no stone unturned in the pursuit of that perfect new-car smell. David Moss, senior vice president, region research & development, added, “That new car smell isn’t just a consequence of the manufacturing process. “Months of work are devoted throughout the development phase of the new vehicle to carefully analyze the use of materials and chemicals, such as seat fabric, adhesives, and polymers, to ensure that they don’t combine to generate an unpleasant odor for the car’s occupants. “It reflects the lengths Nissan goes to in order to make the ownership experience of any new Nissan exactly what our customers hope and expect—even in this very specialiszd area.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nissan-worker-smells-new-car-smell-as-job/
"From the truth is stranger than fiction files comes this story of two babies swapped at birth due to a hospital error. The mixup was discovered when the toddlers were 3, and then, the biological parents were faced with the agonizing prospect of taking the little girls away from the only families they’d ever known. As gut-wrenching as the scenario sounds, this one has a plot twist that’s anything but a tearjerker. Rather than rip the families apart, the collective parents found a way to raise their daughters together—under one roof. Sicilian moms Caterina Alagna and Melissa Fodera, from the fishing village of Mazara del Vallo, were both 23 years old when they gave birth to baby girls 15 minutes apart as the clock ticked toward midnight on December 31, 1998. During the New Year’s Eve celebrations, the on-duty nurses somehow managed to switch out their two tiny charges. When it was time for the mothers and newborns to head home, Alagna and Fodera both questioned why the infants weren’t wearing the clothing they’d brought, but the hospital staff assured them it was merely a wardrobe snafu. Three years later, as Alagna was picking up her daughter Melissa from nursery school, she saw something that shook her to the core. Another child, Caterina by name, bore an uncanny resemblance to Alagna’s two other biological daughters. When she recognized the little girl’s mother Fodera as the woman she’d shared the maternity ward with, the clothing incident popped into her mind—and something clicked. The swaddling hadn’t been switched… the babies had. 15 days later, DNA tests confirmed her suspicions. It was a choice neither one of them wanted to face. “I challenge anyone to raise a daughter for three years then give her up over a simple mistake,” Fodera said in an interview reported by the Times UK. But rather than simply make the swap back, the families decided it would be best to let everyone acclimate to the new situation slowly. Both girls and both sets of parents began spending time together in one house. The arrangement worked out so well that, when the two families separated on the advice of experts for a six-month trial, the plan was quickly scuttled. The switch was explained to Melissa and Caterina when they were 8 years old. The only real complication they’ve faced is the issue with their legal names. Emotionally, however, the two girls, now grown to young adulthood, couldn’t be better. Mauro Caporiccio, author of the book , also recently released as a film by RAI TV told the Times, “The girls effectively grew up with four parents and eight grandparents, and the experiment worked… Today they are more like twins than sisters and there is a kind of love which binds the two families.” The moral of the story? We may not be able to choose the families we’re born into, but we can choose the families we make—and if that choice is made with love, that can be a special thing indeed.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/babies-mixed-up-in-hospital-sicily-mazara/
"In a Finnish collaborative study, researchers noticed that standing is associated with better insulin sensitivity. Increasing the daily standing time may therefore help prevent chronic diseases. Insulin is a key hormone in energy metabolism and blood sugar regulation. Normal insulin function in the body may be disturbed by, for example, being overweight, leading to decreased insulin sensitivity and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Type 2 diabetes is one the most common lifestyle diseases worldwide, and its onset is usually preceded by impaired insulin sensitivity, or insulin resistance. This refers to a state in which the body does not react to insulin normally, and the blood glucose levels rise. Lifestyle has a strong impact on insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes, and regular physical activity is known to have an important role in the prevention of these issues. However, so far, little is known about the impact of sedentary behaviour, breaks in sitting, and standing on insulin resistance. In a study of Turku PET Centre and UKK institute, the researchers investigated the associations between insulin resistance and sedentary behaviour, physical activity and fitness in inactive working-age adults with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. In the study, the researchers observed that standing is associated with better insulin sensitivity independently of the amount of daily physical activity or sitting time, fitness level, or being overweight. “This association has not been shown before. These findings further encourage replacing a part of daily sitting time with standing, especially if physical activity recommendations are not met,” says Doctoral Candidate Taru Garthwaite from the University of Turku. The study also emphasizes the importance of healthy body composition on metabolic health. The results show that increased body fat percentage was a more important factor in terms of insulin sensitivity than physical activity, fitness, or the amount of time spent sitting. Standing, on the other hand, was associated with insulin sensitivity independently, irrespective of body composition. “Regular exercise is well known to be beneficial for health. It seems that physical activity, fitness, and sedentary behaviour are also connected to insulin metabolism, but indirectly, through their effect on body composition,” Taru Garthwaite explains. Causal effects cannot yet be predicted based on this study, published in , but according to Garthwaite, the results suggest that increasing daily standing time may help in prevention of lifestyle diseases if physical activity recommendations are not met. Next, the researchers aim to investigate how changes in daily activity and sedentariness impact cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk factors and metabolism by comparing two groups in an intervention study of a longer duration. “Our aim is to study if reducing daily sitting time by an hour has an impact on energy metabolism and fat accumulation in liver and the whole body, for example, in addition to insulin sensitivity and blood sugar regulation,” says Garthwaite.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/turku-university-standing-improved-insulin/
"If you’ve taken a step back to review your finances during the pandemic, you’re certainly not alone. A new survey revealed 58% of Americans have “completely” changed how they think about money due to the pandemic and nearly as many (56%) believe their concept of financial well-being has been altered since the pandemic. The poll of 2,000 Americans explored the impact financial wellness has on their mental and physical health. In fact, the pandemic caused 48% to increase the amount of money they believe they need in their rainy day or emergency fund. Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of , the survey found respondents added one month of emergency expenses to their savings (an average of five months pre-pandemic to six months now). 3 in 10 respondents said their top financial struggle is establishing good spending habits, so it’s no wonder the top habit they want to change is spending on items they don’t really need (44%). Impulse spending is another habit two in five respondents are trying to shake, and 41% even said they made impulse purchases during the pandemic they regretted. 29% of these respondents blamed pandemic-related stress for their impulse spends—which cost an average of $162 per spend. And while men were less likely to make impulse purchases than women, they were often more expensive with more than 1 in 4 (27%) spending over $250 on their impulse purchase. “After living through the last year and a half, one of the most important things we’ve learned is that there isn’t a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to well-being,” said Lia Dean, President, Retail Bank & Premium Card Products, Capital One. “People have always been stressed about money, perhaps never more so than right now, which is why we want to create a world where our customers can save more and live fully without losing sleep over their finances.” Nearly 3 in 10 (29%) respondents believe their credit score is the strongest indicator of their financial well-being, followed by the ability to pursue their financial goals without concern (19%). 1 in 5 respondents used the pandemic to start a new savings goal as they strive toward a healthier financial future. As they look ahead over the next year, some of Americans’ top goals included starting an emergency fund (39%), paying off their credit card (34%) and starting to save for retirement (24%). With all of these financial firsts and new goals in mind, 33% of those surveyed are confident they could actually become a “finfluencer” to advise their family and friends on financial decision-making.

"One of the biggest debates in modern automotive industry, that there are comparative or more greenhouse gasses produced through EVs and hybrid vehicles, looks to finally be settled after the release of a comprehensive review. Using a life cycle assessment (LCA), the measurement of every ounce of carbon created from the cradle to the grave of the vehicle showed that electric vehicles still had substantially less emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICVs). From the moment the concept of the Toyota Prius had its curtain drawn back for the first time, automotive minds have been skeptical that hybrids and electrics (EVs) would be any more green after considering the extreme carbon costs of creating the battery and the fact that the electricity to charge it came from burning the same fossil fuels they were meant to replace. However in the new LCA from the International Council for Clean Transportation everything, from the mining costs of lithium to make the batteries, to transporting them across the world via container ship, to the end-of-life burden, and even the current and perceived mix of energy generation in a given society, was taken into account across the four dominant car markets: Europe, the U.S., India , and China. Even in the latter two—the biggest burners of coal (often brown coal) and oil for electricity on Earth—it still uses less emissions to drive an EV than an ICV. “Emissions over the lifetime of average medium-size EVs registered today are already lower than comparable gasoline cars by 66%–69% in Europe, 60%–68% in the United States, 37%–45% in China, and 19%–34% in India,” . “Additionally, as the electricity mix continues to decarbonize, the life-cycle emissions gap between EVs and gasoline vehicles increases substantially when considering medium-size cars projected to be registered in 2030.” Early skeptics of EVs and hybrids did have a reason to suspect just how eco-friendly they were at the turn of the century, for example even with modern battery technology, it’s still a little more carbon-intensive to manufacture an EV or hybrid. However like all technologies, market innovations make things better, cheaper, and faster. Battery recycling technology for example would not only drive the cost of the EV down, but also the carbon footprint. A hiccup in the report is that from the International Energy Agency to make projections about the potential energy mix 18 years into the future, which is how long the report assumes a car’s drivable lifespan is. That’s extremely ballpark, as bureaucrats across the world tend to say a lot more than they do in regards to advancing renewable energy policy, and if a major political power shift occurred in any of these countries, the IEA report wouldn’t be accounting for such policy changes. Nevertheless you’d still only have to drive an EV bought today for one year before officially using less carbon than if you bought an ICV.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-biggest-myth-in-electric-vehicles-is-busted-with-new-report/
"With the state of the pandemic varying across the globe, the new normal looks different depending on where you go. But no matter your situation, Google Maps has some helpful new tools to help you navigate and explore as safely as possible. It’s no surprise that transit ridership took a drastic plunge during the early days of the pandemic. While people are returning to public transit—with transit directions on Maps increasing 50% compared to last year in the U.S.—safety remains top of mind. That’s why Google Maps is expanding to over 10,000 transit agencies in 100 countries, so you’ll know if your line is likely to have lots of open seats, hit full capacity, or be anywhere in between. With this information you can decide whether you want to hop on board or wait for another train. Because pandemic or not, no-one likes standing in a jam-packed subway car. These predictions are made possible through our AI technology, contributions from people using Google Maps, and historical location trends that predict future crowdedness levels for transit lines all over the world. ‘All these predictions were designed with privacy in mind. Google : “We apply world-class anonymization technology and to Location History data to make sure your data remains secure and private.” In New York and Sydney, we’re piloting the ability to see live crowdedness information right down to the transit car level. This feature is powered by data from agencies like Long Island Rail Road and Transport for New South Wales, with more cities coming soon. So how is transit crowdedness trending across the U.S.? New York City, Atlanta, San Francisco, Boston, and Washington D.C. lead the pack as some of the cities with the most crowded lines. Nationally, you’re most likely to get a seat at 9 a.m, whereas cars may be standing room only between 7-8 a.m. In the evening, leaving earlier than rush hour will up your chances of grabbing a seat, with lines being far less crowded at 3 p.m. than they are between 4-5 p.m. After living through a global pandemic, people have told us that they want to be more intentional about how they spend their time.

"Sabinoso Wilderness Area in New Mexico, an inaccessible and tiny refuge just five years ago, has grown by almost 10,000 acres, or 50% of its total size, after receiving the largest gift in the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) history. The Cañon Ciruela property was donated by the Trust for Public Land which works to create public spaces from private donations all over America, and was a follow up from another much smaller donation made in 2017 in an effort to grow Sabinoso out from the confines of private landholdings which surrounded it. Described as “a series of high, narrow mesas surrounded by cliff-lined canyons,” the BLM, who manages wilderness areas in the U.S, “rugged country primarily [of] piñon pine and juniper woodlands with occasional clusters of ponderosa pine. A perennial warm season grass savanna is found on the mesa tops. Streams periodically flow in the canyon bottoms supporting riparian vegetation including willow and cottonwood.” The area is home to black bears, mountain lion, elk, mule deer, and turkey, among smaller animals. Pueblo Tribal member and Secretary of the Interior Debra Haaland visited a remote patch of the wilderness in New Mexico’s San Miguel County to talk of the gift, recognizing the land’s history as a hunting ground of several native tribes, including the Jicarilla Apache and northern Pueblos. “We’re here today because we recognize the importance of preserving this special place,” the Secretary said, according to the “We know that nature is essential to the health, well-being and prosperity of every family and every community.” The Cañon Ciruela property provides a second public access point for the wilderness area, which was opened for hiking, primitive camping, hunting, and more under the DOI of Ryan Zinke in 2017. Additionally, the donation permanently protects a critical tributary watershed that feeds into the existing wilderness which ensures there will be nothing but natural forces that interrupt the life-giving waters flowing into the area. The Trust for Public Lands is the kind of entity President Biden is relying on to conserve 30% of America’s geographic area in its natural state as part of his commitment to preventing climate change, and as part of the , which rather than sweeping government penmanship, hopes to rely mainly on private landowners and donations to reach the “30×30 goal.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/new-mexico-wilderness-area-grows-by-50-after-largest-ever-land-donation/
"The Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964 left a mark on the world in the form of the Shinkansen high-speed train, a feat which this year’s repeat hosts look to match with a vision of the future of civic planning. While enduring some criticism for going through with the games during COVID-19, Tokyo has presented the world with the first hydrogen-powered Olympics, complete with an entire fleet of hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, a hydrogen-powered pair of stadiums, a hotel, and Olympic village. Hydrogen power, not to be confused with hydro-electric power, is foreseen by some as the obvious renewable energy of the future. As the most abundant element in the universe, hydrogen fuel-cells produce no emissions of any kind except for water, which can be used to irrigate agriculture or gardens. Like most renewables technologies, hydrogen power has had its fair share of growing pains, but with help from Tokyo’s Research Center for a Hydrogen Energy-Based Society (ReHES), established by the city government in the lead-up to the games, these problems can be surmounted. “With their immense reach and visibility, the Olympic Games are a great opportunity to demonstrate technologies which can help tackle today’s challenges, such as climate change,” Marie Sallois, Director for Sustainability at the International Olympic Committee. “Tokyo 2020’s showcasing of hydrogen is just one example of how these Games will contribute to this goal.” Starting in 2017, Japan became the first nation-state to adopt a national hydrogen strategy, and increased their hydrogen power R&D to around $300 million to fund 2018 and 2019. As part of this push they built one of the largest hydrogen fuel plants in the world in the town of Namie in Fukushima. There, 10,000 kilowatts of clean energy produce 900 metric tons of hydrogen per year: Helping power a fleet of 500 hydrogen cars, 100 hydrogen buses, and even hydrogen forklifts. 35 refueling stations have been built around the city. At the intersection between the Tokyo Bay and heritage zones, the International Olympic Village is the first full-scale hydrogen infrastructure in Tokyo. There, hydrogen fuel cells power lights, heating, and hot water to the dormitories and cafeterias which temporarily house 11,000 athletes. Once the games are concluded, the village will be converted into hydrogen-powered flats, a school, shopping center, and more.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/tokyo-olympics-cauldron-and-village-are-hydrogen-powered/

"Building on substantial evidence of crow consciousness, a German university has proven some crows can learn to recognize ‘zero’ as a counting unit. While that sounds ridiculous, zero is not nothing, rather it’s one of the most complex mathematical concepts devised—that something can and should represent nothing, not only as the base value, but as a placeholder. The work comes from the University of Tübingen in Germany, where professor Andreas Nieder works with carrion crows to perform intelligence tests. “The conception of “nothing” as number “zero” is celebrated as one of the greatest achievements in mathematics,” Nieder in his paper. “We show that crows can grasp the empty set as a null numerical quantity that is mentally represented next to number one.” Exactly how this breakthrough was made is straightforward and did not involve birds watching . The crows were shown two sets of dots on a screen and were taught to indicate if the two screens had the same values. There could be between zero and four dots. Exactly as with 1, 2, 3, and 4—when the screens showed no dots, neurons in the crow’s brain demonstrated it was understanding this was a numeric value, but that it was a numeric value that contained nothing. : Sometimes the crows made mistakes, often by thinking zero was in fact one, but it was rare they thought zero represented more than two. It took human civilization at least to firmly establish the empty or base value. At some point between the Akkadians and Old Babylonians, there was a symbol to represent a number was missing from a column, for example the 0 in 1,025 doesn’t mean the number is 26, it just means there are no hundreds in this number. As early as 1,770 the Egyptians were making hieroglyphs with the base value “nfr” from which began counting and distances. The ponderous Greeks never managed to capture the concept into their counting, language, or philosophy, meaning that as well as occasionally being smarter than a first grader, these “Counting Crows” were smarter in some ways than the Classical Greeks. Nieder contributed greatly to the current theory of animal consciousness, which is that it’s possible this highest level of thought isn’t necessarily bound to the presence of the cerebral cortex, a cranial region found only in primates, apes, and hominids. In an older experiment he trained two crows to peck at panels following a flash of blue light or red light, but Nieder made the task more difficult by changing the rules constantly, which required the crows to zoom out and look at the task as a whole, rather than simply assigning physical motions to a reward. He would change which light was assigned to which panel, and he would sometimes change the rules before the flash, and sometimes after the flash, constantly interrupting the birds’ base instructions. “These results suggest that the neural foundations that allow sensory consciousness arose either before the emergence of mammals or independently in at least the avian lineage and do not necessarily require a cerebral cortex,” wrote Nieder and the other authors in their corresponding paper published in .",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/crows-make-another-intelligence-breakthrough-understanding-zero/

"As a newborn mammal opens its eyes for the first time, it can already make visual sense of the world around it. But how does this happen before they have experienced sight? A new Yale study suggests that, in a sense, mammals dream about the world they are about to experience before they are even born. Writing in the latest issue of , a team led by , the William Ziegler III Professor of Neuroscience and professor of ophthalmology and visual science at Yale, describes waves of activity that emanate from the neonatal retina in mice before their eyes ever open. This activity disappears soon after birth and is replaced by a more mature network of neural transmissions of visual stimuli to the brain, where information is further encoded and stored. At eye opening, mammals are capable of pretty sophisticated behavior,” said Crair, senior author of the study, who is also vice provost for research at Yale.” But how do the circuits form that allow us to perceive motion and navigate the world? It turns out we are born capable of many of these behaviors, at least in rudimentary form.” In the study, Crair’s team, led by Yale graduate students Xinxin Ge and Kathy Zhang, explored the origins of these waves of activity. Imaging the brains of mice soon after birth but before their eyes opened, the Yale team found that these retinal waves flow in a pattern that mimics the activity that would occur if the animal were moving forward through the environment This early dream-like activity makes evolutionary sense because it allows a mouse to anticipate what it will experience after opening its eyes, and be prepared to respond immediately to environmental threats,” Crair noted. Going further, the Yale team responsible for propagating the retinal waves that mimic forward motion in neonatal mice. They found that blocking the function of starburst amacrine cells, which are cells in the retina that release neurotransmitters, prevents the waves from flowing in the direction that mimics forward motion. This in turn impairs the development of the mouse’s ability to respond to visual motion after birth. Intriguingly, within the adult retina of the mouse these same cells play a crucial role in a more sophisticated motion detection circuit that allows them to respond to environmental cues. Mice, of course, differ from humans in their ability to quickly navigate their environment soon after birth. However, human babies are also able to immediately detect objects and identify motion, such as a finger moving across their field of vision, suggesting that their visual system was also primed before birth. These brain circuits are self-organized at birth and some of the early teaching is already done,” Crair said. “It’s like dreaming about what you are going to see before you even open your eyes.” ( the Yale video for this story below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/yale-study-mammals-might-dream-about-the-world-before-born/
"A wildlife fan who set up a camera in a bird box to film a family of blue tits was stunned when the videos attracted 41 million hits in one month. 43-year-old John Chadwick started live-streaming footage of the birds with their chicks so his family could watch their progress before they flew the nest. But just weeks after uploading the videos to YouTube, he racked up millions of views from around the world. John said: “It’s gone a little bit bonkers. I only wanted to show my neighbors, friends, nieces, and nephews what the birds were up to. I had no idea the films would attract such interest. “To think that literally tens of millions of people have been avidly watching the birds from around the world is just incredible and quite overwhelming.” The sound engineer, who has toured with Aerosmith and the Beatles’ Ringo Starr, bought the bird box on a whim during lockdown. He installed it on a willow tree in the back garden of his home in Leicester in March, and within hours two blue tits moved in and they had five chicks. John said: “Within a day the birds moved in, and I wanted to know what was going on inside. “I’d learnt how to livestream to help my local pub do their open mic, and over lockdown in February I bought a bird box camera. “I started to livestream and do a highlights video every day—on the first day 100 people watched it. “It showed things like the chicks being fed in the nests as the parents carried in caterpillars. “Daily highlights continued, and about three days before the chicks fledged, I hit 100 subscribers. “After three months of doing three hours editing a night of 15 hours of daily footage, I had 2,000 subscribers. “I decided to put a final video together and keep it as short as possible—showing the birds going into the nests, the eggs hatching, and the chicks fledging. “I put that up on June 7 and by Thursday 100,000 people had watched it, and by Saturday I had five million views. “I went to a barbecue on Saturday afternoon and when I came back I had two million more In the first week I had done 10 million and now more than 41 million. It is just bizarre.” are mostly watched by people in America and India, with UK audiences accounting for just five per cent of his total views. And despite the huge global success of the films, John is unlikely to make enough for a nest egg of his own. He said: “My personal challenge to myself was to cross the threshold to get monetized, and then recoup the £150 I paid for the camera and £90 for the hard drive—it is due any day. “Some people say they find it quite relaxing and some people are genuinely fascinated.” ( a great compilation of the best bird moments below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/john-chadwick-birdbox-videos-41-million-hits/
"In a drive to soak up some of the 527 million small electrical items owned by UK homes, many of which would be thrown in the trash, a new campaign to repair, recycle, or ethically scrap electricals is underway in Glasgow. The is utilizing local resources like mend and repair stores, conscious consumers, and state campaigns to get devices into the hands of those that need them, and valuable materials out of the machines that don’t. Run by the non-profit , and relying on support from the Glasgow city council and the Remade Network, The Recycle your Electricals campaign is already seeing a huge response. With a focus on repairing, donating, recycling, and reselling, it’s essentially a massive reshuffle of the distribution of electrical goods. “For too long, consumers have been blamed for not reusing and repairing enough when the facilities don’t exist for people to make better choices,” said Sophie Unwin, Director of Remade Network, who are contributing their which allows people to bring anything with a battery or plug that will fit into a carrier bag to one of their locations, giving residents the option of “ethical binning,” with Remade sort out the details. This has allowed them to donate 1,000 desktop PCs, sourced from government offices, to households that have no access to the internet through 50 local charity groups. The social enterprise has so far diverted 250 tons of CO2. Material Focus estimates that the cost of the materials contained within unwanted electricals amounts to around £17 billion ($24 billion). A lot of these have to be dug out of the earth at extreme costs to companies—and to the climate in the form of CO2. “This project is vital to ensuring that we make good use of our old electricals,” said Scott Butler, Executive Director of Material Focus. “Whether they are re-used or recycled—these items contain valuable materials that will otherwise be lost forever. Our research has shown that in the UK we are hoarding over 527 million small electrical items, an average of 20 per household.” Along with funding from Glasgow City Council, Remade Network and Material Focus receive money through a (Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment) which sets parameters to which manufacturers can design products in order to ensure they can be recycled. Any non-compliance is punished with a tax that goes to a fund which groups like Remade and Material Focus draw from. Material Focus’ recycling locator has over 2,500 points where people can take their old e-waste, a service which 127,000 people have already used. E-waste is a growing problem worldwide, but that’s perhaps because there’s been no large-scale solution for it. Receiving old electronics, harvesting them for components, and selling them to manufacturers for cheap is a great way to keep rare minerals in the ground, and prices down at the shops.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/uk-campaign-to-recycle-reuse-or-resell-old-electronics/
"In the first ever measurement of another planet’s core, seismography conducted over several Martian years have revealed the liquid metal core is softer than expected—more like a Mars-mellow than a Mars Bar. While the recently arrived Perseverance rover has been hoovering up much of the Mars-related attention, a trio of recently published papers that measured the depth and composition of the crust, mantle, and iron-nickel core of the Red Planet—made by the 2018 NASA InSight lander—is looking to steal the limelight. Using the same techniques in Earth seismography, geo-planetary scientists looked at data gained from InSight’s extremely sensitive seismometer to measure a series of “marsquakes.” The data they recovered help paint a picture of the progression of Mars from a planet that once had loads of liquid water and a stable atmosphere thanks to its magnetic field, to a world of frigid temperatures and rust. There were challenges, and in what National Geographic described as a major analytical feat, it’s worth mentioning what needed overcoming. Through all this, the team managed to get dimensions of the planet’s core, the upper mantle, and the Martian crust—all to within a few miles of accuracy. “As a seismologist, you probably have one chance in your life to find a core for a planet,” says InSight member Simon Stähler, a seismologist at the research university ETH Zurich, in an interview with . Their principle resources were P-waves and S-waves, the same two tremor types that scientists measure on Earth and on the Moon. P-waves move a bit like wind on water, pushing things down, while S-waves vibrate and wriggle side-to-side, dislodging particles as they move. These two waves move through different kinds of matter, giving a sort of “length and height” level of granularity. P-waves can move through solids, liquids, and gasses, while S-waves can move only through solids. Because the P-waves can go through a solid mantle into a liquid core, measuring their readings in a way similar to sonar gives you an idea of the depth of the core, while measuring the return speed of the S-wave gives you a depth at which the core begins, since it can’t pass through liquid, and returns surface-bound. By measuring a set of P-wave, S-wave, and then a fainter delayed S-wave a few hundred seconds later, the team determined that the Martian core is around 1,830 kilometers wide, slightly bigger than anticipated. This means that unlike Earth, which has an upper mantle and lower mantle, Mars has only one—about “We inferred a mean core density of 5.7 to 6.3 grams per cubic centimeter, which requires a substantial complement of light elements dissolved in the iron-nickel core,” write the authors, which published a paper on each planetary layer, in the journal Estimated to contain carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur, this softer-than-expected core and single-layer lithosphere could shed light on the creation and disappearance of the Martian magnetosphere which took place 3.7 billion years ago. With a smaller lithosphere and a more porous core, convection currents would have created the potential for rapid cooling of the interior which as the genesis for the Martian magnetosphere. The loss of the magnetosphere would have caused the original Martian atmosphere to dissipate, so understanding what planetary components might have led to that is key to understanding why Mars lost all her water and became a cold rusty desert. Lastly, by , which consists of either two or three layers at a depth between 24 and 72 kilometers, the team found that radioactive, heat-producing elements were 13-21 times more plentiful than elsewhere, which could help form a working theory on why Martian volcanoes appear where they do on a planet that has no plate tectonic forces which would normally create them. The Red Planet is revealing its secrets to us, forming a case study of planetary geosciences in conditions totally unlike those on Earth, and expanding our capabilities of understanding the most interesting heavenly bodies—planets.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/martian-core-crust-and-mantle-all-measured-for-the-first-time-by-insight-lander/
"More than three years ago at a hospital in Portland, Oregon, Lawson Lundberg was born prematurely. After spending several weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit, doctors expected the boy to have significant delays in cognitive development. Despite not hearing more than two words during the first two years of his life, Lawson’s mother, Sara, witnessed a sudden change. “He seemed leaps-and-bounds ahead, learning shapes without us having to teach him, learning words we don’t even remember saying around him.” “Earlier this year, during the ice storm, we were without power for a few days and during that time he learned the names of countries and their capitals. It was then that we figured out he had somehow learned phonics on his own, which blew us away.” Now, at 3-years-old, Lawson knows every flag, country, and capitol in the world. While other kids were learning to walk, Lawson was naming all 50 states and 195 countries! His vocabulary is ever-growing and his interest in learning is unique—so much so, that his parents had his IQ tested professionally. The tyke scored 151. For reference, Albert Einstein’s IQ was estimated at between 160 and 180, but much later in life. Lawson’s parents signed up their son to join the national intelligence organization Mensa, ranking him among the group’s youngest members. An IQ of 130 is required to join, and at 3 years old Lawson is far ahead of that pace and not done yet. “About 21% of the IQ test, he didn’t get any of the questions wrong, so they ran out of questions to ask him,” Sara told GNN. “Normally once you get a few wrong they move on, but they weren’t able to move on until they ran out, which is not normal by any means.” They recommended he get tested again in a few years to get a more accurate look at his IQ because the test for older kids has an unlimited number of questions. : It is a remarkable journey for any child, but especially a premature baby born with a higher risk for cognitive delays and disabilities. “He’s into currency now and is asking questions like, ‘Where’s my money?'” Sara said with a laugh. : The gifted Lawson is also channeling his creative side to ‘give back’ to the community. “We have talked about the importance of charity,” said Sara. “March of Dimes helped us out a lot when Lawson and his twin sister were in the NICU.” : Now, Lawson has picked up a paintbrush and ‘made it his mission’ to earn money for the charity. He’s raised $525 from family friends, but now they’re offering to send the boy’s paintings—which consist of the exact shapes of states or countries—to strangers who donate on .

"A new partnership with police in Colorado is putting smiles on the faces of motorists who might not have the money to fix a broken part on their vehicle. An Advance Auto Parts store has gifted the Denver Police Department with 100 gift cards worth $25 each to hand out to drivers who are normally pulled over by cops and given a warning or ticket to pay a fine. “Now, when they pull over a motorist for, say, a bad headlight or a defective taillight, they’ll have the option to give a $25 gift card to help the motorist get it fixed–and get them back on the road and stay safe,” a representative of Advance Auto Parts explained.

"Our partner Rob Brezsny provides his weekly wisdom to enlighten our thinking and motivate our mood. Rob’s , is a syndicated weekly column appearing in over a hundred publications. He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Leo poet Renée Ashley articulates a perspective I recommend you adopt. She writes, “I’m drawn to what flutters nebulously at the edges, at the corner of my eye—just outside my certain sight. I want to share in what I am routinely denied, or only suspect exists. I long for a glimpse of what is beginning to occur.” With her thoughts as inspiration, I advise you to be hungry for what you don’t know and haven’t perceived. Expand your curiosity so that it becomes wildly insatiable in its quest to uncover budding questions and raw truths at the peripheries of your awareness. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): There are many things in your heart you can never tell to another person,” declared Virgo actor (1905–1990). “It is not right that you should tell them,” she concluded. “You cheapen yourself, the inside of yourself, when you tell them.” I presume Greta was being melodramatic. My attitude is the opposite of hers. If you find allies who listen well and who respect your vulnerability, you should relish telling them the secrets of your heart. To do so enriches you, deepens you, and adds soulful new meanings to your primary mysteries. The coming weeks will be a favorable time to seek this wise pleasure in abundance. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Now is a fantastic time to seek out effervescent socializing and convivial gatherings and festive celebrations. If you surround yourself with lively people, you’ll absorb the exact influences you need. May I suggest you host a fun event? If you do, you could send out invitations that include the following allures: “At my get-together, the featured flavors will be strawberry chocolate and impossibly delicious. There’ll be magic vibrations and mysterious mood-enhancers. Liberating conversations will be strongly encouraged. Unpredictable revelations will be honored. If possible, please unload your fears and anxieties in a random parking lot before arriving.” SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Scorpio author writes, “As the Japanese will tell you, one can train a rose to grow through anything, to grow through a nautilus even, but it must be done with tenderness.” I think that’s a vivid metaphor for one of your chief tasks in the coming weeks, Scorpio: how to carefully nurture delicate, beautiful things as you coax them to ripen in ways that will bring out their sturdiness and resilience. I believe you now have an extra capacity for wielding love to help things bloom. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Suggested experiments to try soon: 1. Remember a past moment when you were touched with the sudden realization that you and a person you’d recently met were destined to fall in love. 2. Remember a past moment when you kissed someone for the first time. 3. Remember a past moment when someone told you they loved you for the first time or when you told someone you loved them for the first time. 4. Allow the feelings from the first three experiments to permeate your life for five days. See through the eyes of the person you were during those previous breakthroughs. Treat the whole world as expansively and expectantly as you did during those times. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Capricorn poet was shirtless as he strolled along a rural road. To his delightful amazement, a fritillary butterfly landed on his shoulder, fluttered away, landed again, fluttered away—performed this dance numerous times. Nothing like this had ever happened to him. Later he wrote, “I feel my flesh / Has suddenly become sweet / With a metamorphosis / Kept secret even from myself.” In the coming days, I’m expecting at least one comparable experience for you. Here’s your homework: What sweet metamorphoses may be underway within you—perhaps not yet having reached your conscious awareness? AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): “Each time we don’t say what we want to say, we’re dying.” Aquarian artist and singer said that. I will add a further nuance: Each time we’re not aware of the feeling or experience or situation we want, we’re dying. And these will be key themes now that you’ve entered the “I KNOW WHAT I WANT AND I KNOW HOW TO ASK FOR IT” phase of your cycle. The most healing and vivifying thing you can do during the next six weeks is to be precise about your desires. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): In 1829, Piscean author began work on his novel, . He had other projects, though, and by September 1830, he had made scant progress on . Growing impatient, his publisher demanded that he finish the manuscript by February 1831. In response, Hugo virtually barricaded himself in his room to compel himself to meet the deadline. He even locked his clothes in a closet to prevent himself from going out. For the next five months, he wore only a gray shawl as he toiled nonstop. His stratagem worked! I recommend you consider trying a somewhat less rigorous trick to enforce your self-discipline in the coming weeks. There’s no need to barricade yourself in your fortress. But I hope you will have fun taking stringent measures. ARIES (March 21-April 19): What does it mean to *feel real*? Some people have a hard time doing that. They have such false ideas about who they are that they rarely feel real. Others are so distracted by trivial longings that they never have the luxury of settling into the exquisite at-home-ness of feeling real. For those fortunate enough to regularly experience this treasured blessing, feeling real isn’t a vague concept. It’s a vivid sensation of being conscious in one’s body. When we feel real, we respond spontaneously, enjoy playing, and exult in the privilege of being alive. After studying your astrological potentials, Aries, I suspect that you now have an enhanced capacity to feel real. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): When she was a child, author visited her secret sanctuary at sunset every day for seven years. She lay on the ground among birch trees and aromatic privet plants, feeling “the steady rhythmic heartbeat of the earth” as she basked in the fading light. I’d love for you to enjoy the revitalizing power of such a shrine. The decisions you have to make will become clear as you commune with what Andrews calls “a rootlike umbilicus to the dark core of the land.” Do you know of such a place? If not, I suggest you find or create one. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): I suspect that your immediate future will be a patchwork of evocative fragments. You may be both annoyed and entertained by a series of flashing attractions, or an array of pretty baubles, or a hubbub of tasks that all seem at least mildly worth doing. Chances are good that they will ultimately knit together into a crazy-quilt unity; they will weave into a pattern that makes unexpected sense. In the spirit of the spicy variety, I offer three quotes that may not seem useful to you yet, but will soon. 1. “Isn’t it possible that to desire a thing, to truly desire it, is a form of having it?” – 2. “It is not half so important to know as to feel.” — Rachel Carson 3. “Like all explorers, we are drawn to discover what’s out there without knowing yet if we have the courage to face it.” — Pema Chödrön CANCER (June 21-July 22): A Tumblr blogger named Cece writes, “The fact that you can soak bread in sugar, eggs, cinnamon, and vanilla, then butter a pan and fry said bread to make a meal is really liberating.” I agree. And I share this with you in the hope of encouraging you to indulge in other commonplace actions that will make you feel spacious and uninhibited. You’re in a phase of your astrological cycle when you’ll thrive on doing day-to-day details that excite your lust for life. Enjoying the little things to the utmost will be an excellent strategy for success.

"A real-life Indiana Jones believes he may have found the secret location of the Holy Grail and the Ark of the Covenant—under a house in Staffordshire. Historian and anthropologist David Adkins is convinced that priceless treasures, which were taken from Jerusalem in 1307, were stashed beneath Sinai Park House in Burton-on-Trent. He claims to have uncovered links between the property and the Knights Templar who concealed the mythical Ark and Grail centuries ago. David is now hoping to search the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the 14th century house to prove the Holy Grail was hidden there. “I’ve been researching it for 34 years, so I’ve really got a complete history of the place and looked into archives that no one had touched before,” said the 50-year-old. “There are so many pointers that when Knights Templar left La Rochelle in 1307 we know they had a treasure. There are theories about Oak Island in Nova Scotia and Roslyn Chapel in Scotland but it has never been found.” “Sinai House is the most obvious place once you get inside the mind of a medieval Templar,” he says. “The name Sinai really shouts at you from the pages of history because you have got no other ancient house with that name.” The two key points for Adkins is the labyrinth of natural tunnels and caves and the timing of when Burton Abbey monks took possession of that house—at the same time as the Templars were trying to conceal that hoard. “A geologist once told me that there were caverns as big as Westminster Abbey beneath the house,” he told . In 1880, a dig took place in the Sinai House tunnels and archaeologists reached half-a-mile underground before being ‘forced back by fumes’. The cellar’s stone archway has remained bricked up since. “We know there is really strong evidence they brought manuscripts and gold from the Temple of Solomon in 1307. I think they adapted the tunnels to conceal whatever they brought from Jerusalem.” : David said the family living in Sinai House at the time left in the early 1300s, and Burton Abbey then took over the property, which was hidden by Needham Forest atop a hill that drops into the Trent Valley. Kate Murphy, the current owner has now given David permission to search the vast caverns under her home in a bid to solve the mystery. The researcher, who previously made headlines when he tracked down a 10,000-year-old skull known as ‘Greta’, wants to start his search with a geophysical scan. Murphy, 56, bought the house in 1994 for £50,000. It is nationally designated as a Grade II historical building— which means it is of ‘special interest warranting every effort to preserve’ it. : : “It’s a hugely important site and I first saw it with my late husband David in 1990 because we liked timber framed houses. “I’m totally wedded to the idea that there is something there,” she told SWNS. “I think the theory is very good, well researched and I’m very impressed by David’s work.” “I’m very excited about it and it’s not cynicism about the story that I think it is unlikely something will be found – that is because of the inaccessibility of the tunnels. “There is plenty more evidence in the house like the wall paintings of the tabernacle that there is something going on.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/sinai-house-knights-templar-treasure/
"A formerly homeless man with a severely deformed hands has been able to rebuild his life after discovering a new way to communicate, thanks to a novel hexagonal smartphone keyboard made in Switzerland. Russ Miller, 36, from Ohio, was first diagnosed with the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis when he was just 26. The condition attacks the body’s joints, making it progressively more difficult for him to do everyday tasks. “My hands are deformed. They’re not shaped properly and I can’t bend them like everyone else can. Recently my thumb has stopped working, so I can’t bend it,” said Miller in a letter to the company. “I can no longer use normal computer keyboards and it’s hard for me to even hold a pen anymore.” Russ’ condition led to a downward spiral which resulted in him living on the streets in Florida for 4 years—but in 2018, he started trying to turn his life around. “I was trying to get help and get myself out of my situation. I had a phone, but I struggled typing on keyboards… So I started looking for alternative smartphone keyboards that might enable me to type again. I found Typewise by accident.” Russ attributes Typewise smartphone keyboard with enabling him to “get his life back” by empowering him to communicate with people, and therefore get help, get an apartment and even get a job: “I was able to communicate a lot better than talking, because my voice is kind of monotone so people don’t understand me very well. And because I was able to start typing on my phone again, I was able to use social media to reach out to an organization that helps people with disabilities.” It’s the hexagonal layout of the keyboard that Russ finds a whole lot easier. “I can move my fingers around and not mess up as often.” “Now I have a part-time job where I take care of dogs and cats; Tuesdays and Thursdays. I can’t work full time, because of my physical issues but at least I have something to do and something to look forward to.” : The company making the smartphone app, which has a popularity rating of 4.5 stars, had been unaware that their unique keyboard design could help people with reduced dexterity, until they . “We’re just a small start-up from Switzerland so we were really quite surprised when Russ contacted us to say how much Typewise had helped turn his life around,” said Typewise co-founder, Janis Bernecker. We never thought we could have such a profound impact on someone’s life, especially someone on another continent.” The free app for Android and iPhones has over a million users and about its privacy features (‘your keystrokes don’t leave your phone’), along with superior accuracy (4x fewer typos) and a ‘supercharged AI autocorrect’. : But, the positive review from Russ might be the thing they are most proud of now. “It’s incredibly fulfilling for us to hear Russ’ inspirational story and we wanted to share it because there could be other people like Russ who Typewise could also help.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/homeless-man-with-deformed-hands-discovers-new-way-to-type/
"With summer barbecue season well underway in the Northern Hemisphere, many of us are wondering if those citronella candles are even working to keep away the biting bugs. Science tells us that mosquitoes are peculiar insects that can’t be generalized as much as we would wish, which is why, at the end of your BBQ, some of the guests might be more bitten up than others. While we are happy to sweep all of the wretched bloodsuckers under the same moniker of ‘mosquito,’ different species of mosquitoes have different methods of locating their host. A fact sheet for mozzies is imperative, therefore, to minimize the annoyance these insects can bring. All mosquitoes use CO2 from human and animal breath as a guide to the location of a potential host. Ada McVean writing for Canada’s McGill Office for Science and Society, the surprisingly complicated way in which mosquitoes try and find their target in a recent article. According to McVean, if you’ve ever seen a mosquito zigzag in the air, that’s the sign they’ve just lost the CO2 scent, and are trying to find it again. Once it brings them to the general position, they use visual features to look for signs of heat, and odors to provide them with the exact position. Human sweating increases the natural olfactory cues of lactic acid, ammonia, and other chemicals that mosquitoes use to find people, so They can also find you through sweet-scented deodorant, body wash, shampoo, and other products—but they’ve been sucking our blood for millions of years so don’t need them. Most of us will have had a conversation or been in a situation at least once, wherein one person expresses their annoyance of mosquitoes which seem to be leaving someone else alone. It could be that the bitten person has a particular blood type which mosquitoes prefer. Many studies have been conducted looking to see if a human’s blood type has some relation to their vulnerability to mosquitoes, and many of them seem to suggest that different species prefer different blood types. A Sri Lankan that 30% of starved female mosquitoes, the majority preferred O-type blood, compared to 25% for AB, and 20% for B. This species is famed for its spread of diseases like Dengue, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever. that it was a combination of blood type, and a genetic feature some humans possess that cause them to secret substances related to their blood type onto their skin, which brought the mosquitoes, in this case a malaria spreader called to the host. If someone with an O or B blood type were a secretor, their chance was 15-20% higher for an unpleasant visit, whereas A nonsecretors were landed on more than if they were a secretor, showing the complexity of the human-mosquito feeding methods. Physical measures are the principal ones that should be employed, long sleeves, high socks, etc., but it’s also something most people don’t want to do in the heat of summer. Some modern outdoor wear has mosquito repellent infused into the threading, which has been scientifically-shown to work. However the treatment fades overtime, and there are about the safety of placing such chemicals like permethrin next to your skin, especially for children. Craghoppers, the English outdoor brand, even recommends throwing away any treated clothes after a set number of washes. While the world still struggles to come up with a breakthrough malaria medication, mosquito netting has been saving thousands of lives in the tropics for years, and while the mosquitoes in the U.S. aren’t carrying malaria, the net is still a proven technology. : After it was developed by the U.S. Army in 1946, DEET was registered for use by the general public in 1957. , every year an estimated one-third of the U.S. population use DEET to protect themselves and their families from mosquito-borne illnesses like West Nile Virus, the Zika virus or malaria and tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. As the world’s most thoroughly studied insect repellent, DEET, has been shown to be remarkably safe. ( more evidence.) The authors of a 2002 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine wrote, “This repellent has been subjected to more scientific and toxicological scrutiny than any other repellent substance,” continuing, “DEET has a remarkable safety profile after 40 years of use and nearly 8 billion human applications,” concluding, “When applied with common sense, can be expected to provide a safe as well as long-lasting repellent effect.” Most of the concerns can be attributed to people using products with too high a concentration of the chemical, or using it in an improper way. Concerns about rare DEET side-effects, including skin irritation, breathing difficulty, burning eyes, headaches, or seizures, were reported after, in some cases, the chemical was ingested or applied in very large quantities. : While the for use or concentration of DEET in a given product, Canada’s government recommends against using a product that has more than 30% concentration, and with a ceiling of 10% for children 12 and under. As a precaution, manufacturers advise that DEET products should not be used on damaged skin, and that preparations be washed off after they are no longer needed or between applications. Still not convinced? Here are some alternatives. Icaridin, also known as picaridin, is a good alternative to DEET and provides equivalent protection for up to 7 hours. It has broad efficacy against various insects such as mosquitos, ticks, gnats, flies and fleas, and is almost colorless and odorless. A study performed in 2010 showed that at the 20% concentration provided 12 hours of protection against ticks. The compound was developed by the German chemical company Bayer and later evaluated and recommended as a repellent by Consumer Reports. Commercial products containing icaridin include Cutter Advanced, Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus, and Autan. : Citronella, a formula commonly-found in mosquito repelling candles, was actually pegged as The authors of the study pointed out that natural insect repellents based on essential oils tend to be entirely untested, something repellent shoppers should take note of. “There are no published data describing the repellency of oils of canola, goldenseal, patchouli, rhodiumwood, sage, sweet birch, tansy, tea tree, or vetivert to mosquitoes, for example, nor has the repellency of glycerin, lecithin, menthol, extracts of barberry, chamomile, goldenseal, or myrrh to any pest or vector species been shown in scientific studies,” they write. “Of the 26 oils incorporated in the products we tested, only geranium, lavender, and peppermint oils, at the 100% concentration, repelled for (more than) 1 hour.” Some products with soybean oil are marketed as insect repellents, but the soybean oil likely has nothing to do with the products’ success and is instead attributable to the other chemicals inside these products, such as geranium oil. Sweet lemony-scented citronella candles or incense coils are often sold as insect repellent smokescreens. Citronella candles and diffusers to work with minimal protection, especially outside, but linalool and geraniol, two plant oils often included within citronella candles, were found to fare much better. In short, buy a product that has all three for a pleasantly-smelling, and actually functional mosquito repellent, and if one can find an oil diffuser instead of a candle, even better. Some products like bug zappers and others which play high-frequency sounds that supposedly disrupt mosquitoes in this snippet from a study which thusly investigated: “We are not aware of any scientific study showing that mosquitoes can be repelled by sound waves and therefore we consider these devices as the modern equivalent of snake oil.” :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/science-shows-the-strategies-and-products-which-actually-repel-mosquitoes/

"Not being able to see the world in the same way as others is often considered a drawback, but the view from a different lens can also be revelatory. 79-year-old Robert Ballard, a pioneer in underwater robotic technology, always knew he was “wired differently” than most folks, but it was only a few years ago that he learned he was dyslexic. While he finally had an explanation for early learning issues that set him apart from his peers, the realization also went a long way toward explaining just how extraordinary his particular gift of vision was. As National Geographic “explorer at large,” along with his ongoing robotic research at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Ballard’s milieu is literally the wide oceans of the Earth. “I live in a world where everywhere I go is totally dark, so you have to visualize it in your mind… Dyslexics are extremely good at visualization of three-dimensional space,” Ballard told “When I am at my command center… I’m able to take all of that information into my head and then form a mental image of a world of total darkness [where I’m] extremely comfortable… because I see it in my mind.” Before discovering he was dyslexic, Ballard assumed that’s how everyone else saw the world as well, but it’s his singular ability to simultaneously assimilate vast quantities of information “eyes-on” that’s led to his greatest achievements. Ballard is the man responsible for finding the wreck of the While it’s arguably the historic footnote he’ll be best remembered for (at least by search engines), ironically, when the discovery was made, Ballard was on a top-secret mission for the U.S. government. Searching for the storied lost liner was just his cover story. In addition to locating other notable shipwrecks—like the infamous Nazi battleship, the , the aircraft carrier , and the torpedo patrol boat last commanded by John F. Kennedy who saved his crew when it sunk during WWII—the technology spearheaded by Ballard has given us some of the most comprehensive scientific knowledge of the ocean floor to date. Ballard’s robot denizens have plumbed the mysteries of plate tectonics and explored vast, previously uncharted undersea biomes home to creatures straight out of an movie, including 13-foot worms with nightmarish gnashing teeth. Thinking outside the box of conventional maritime history, Ballard plotted a direct trading route across the Mediterranean Sea between ancient Rome and Carthage by following a trail of discarded empty wine bottles that were tossed overboard by sailors at mealtime. None of these things, he believes, would have been possible had he not seen the world through a dyslexic’s eyes. “I often wonder how my life would have been different had I known I was dyslexic… I think I arrived at a good spot, but I got there by a very strange route,” he told . In his new autobiography, , Ballard chronicles his personal history and storied career, along with the very important role his dyslexia played in all that he’s accomplished. “Everyone needs to understand that dyslexics aren’t stupid, they’re just a different kind of human being. They see the world in a very different way,” Ballard told the . “This book is a coming-out party for my dyslexia. I’m standing on a soapbox now and saying, ‘I’m dyslexic,’ and I feel so lucky’.” Nearing 80, Ballard is mentoring more these days, but he continues to be actively involved in new projects, including the design and implementation of a fleet of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), which he says can be programmed “like a pack of hounds” to hunt the estimated 3,999,040 remaining shipwrecks (that’s minus the 60 he’s already found) languishing beneath the waves. In addition, Ballard is partnering with National Geographic to create a program offering educational opportunities so that dyslexics who come from disadvantaged backgrounds can better achieve their full potential. “When I was growing up, my Kansas grandmother was full of sayings, and I remember one in particular…  ‘Great is the person who plants a tree knowing they will never sit in its shade.’ That’s where I am now. I’m planting trees.” ( Robert Ballard’s popular Ted Talk below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/dyslexia-titanic-bob-ballard-titanic/
"A two-legged pooch who was rescued from the streets of Afghanistan has made a remarkable recovery—and loves running on his two legs. Maz the Labrador cross was struck by a car that crushed both of his back legs in 2013, and was left to roam the streets of the war-torn nation. UK NHS doctor Helene Svinos said she saw a video of the ‘friendliest dog’ online on Valentine’s Day in 2015 and couldn’t stop thinking about him. Despite his severe injuries, Maz was ‘full of joy’ and Helene decided she had to bring him back to her home in Manchester, England. After contacting old friend Louise Hastie, a former soldier who rescues dogs from war zones, the dog was taken to Kabul and eventually flown to the UK in May that year. Maz has joined a gang of other pups at Helene’s home, as she has six rescue dogs including paraplegic Pomeranian Bambi and blind Husky Inka, both from Romania. Despite having both of his back legs amputated after they were fused together, Maz has remained upbeat and is always raring to go for runs. Helene said the pooch has repeatedly refused to wear wheels or walking aids as he loves to ‘scuttle around as fast as lighting’. Marvellous Maz has even beaten Helene’s three springer spaniels in a sprint, despite them competing in CaniCross races. Helene said: “Maz is just a complete and utter star. You can’t feel sad or unhappy around him as he’s full of joy—except for when it’s raining. “Maz has never let anything stop him from doing all the things he wants to do—including rolling in mud! “He just lives in the moment and he doesn’t focus on what happened in the past.” Helene, who works on the frontline as an A&E doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary, said coming home to her dogs has helped her throughout the Covid crisis. She said: “I’m an A&E doctor working during lockdown, but coming home he just puts things into perspective. “It’s been difficult at times during lockdown, feeling lonely, but then I come back to these happy dogs.” The intelligent pooch somehow found his way to a vet where he befriended one of the doctors and would always leap up to greet anyone despite his injuries, Helene said. They tried to keep the friendly pooch healthy but with limited resources, they were unable to do much more and posted an appeal online. Louise Hastie from , a charity she set up to help dogs in areas of civil conflict, helped bring Maz to Manchester where he is now ‘full of life’. He had two four-hour surgeries to remove his back legs in May 2015 before he finally found his forever home with Helene. Helene said: “He’s just the most wonderful dog and I’m so grateful to have him in my life. “There are so many incredible dogs in the world who need homes, and they will bring you as much joy as you give them. “I have a special love for disabled dogs, and I think people are worried that they may have problems but that’s just not true. “They get overlooked often but they can live a full and happy life.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/a-two-legged-pooch-who-was-rescued-afghanistan-maz/
"Starlight Nintendo Switch Gaming stations have been making their way to hospitals and health care facilities across the country. Each station comes preloaded with more than 25 games from to . The station is specially designed and manufactured by Nintendo for use in a hospital setting. The device can be completely cleaned with disinfectant to meet a hospital’s strict safety infection protocols and includes a mounted playback monitor that can roll anywhere in a hospital, so children can enjoy some of their favorite Nintendo video games from the comfort of their own hospital beds or in a playroom with a group of other children. Gaming delivers happiness to kids stuck in the hospital by providing entertainment and much-needed distraction from stressful situations. According to , it can even provide emotional support, resulting in reduced anxiety and improved mood. Doctors, nurses, clinicians, and child life specialists are able to use a single Starlight Gaming station in a variety of settings, from entertaining children during a relative’s visit to the emergency room, to distracting kids during an otherwise painful medical treatment, to giving kids something fun to do during long periods of isolation or with a group of other kids, or helping them to relax and feel comfortable when communicating with caregivers about their diagnosis. In 28 years, the partnership of Starlight with Nintendo of America has delivered Gaming stations to over 800 hospitals and healthcare facilities all over the country—bringing smiles to an estimated 11.6 million seriously ill children. “Over the years, Starlight Gaming stations have provided millions of seriously ill children with the healing power of play, entertainment, socialization, and emotional support, and have helped to normalize an otherwise scary situation or setting for families,” , CEO of Starlight, said. “We’re so grateful to Nintendo and their employees for such a long and continuing partnership fueled by innovation, impact, and generous support.” “It’s been our pleasure to work with Starlight and observe them bringing happiness to kids when they need it the most,” , Nintendo of America’s Executive Vice President of Operations, added. “As with everything we do, we hope the new Starlight Nintendo Switch gaming stations will put smiles on the faces of children and their families.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nintendo-starlight-gaming-station-hospitals-kids/
"People with who deeply feel the pain or happiness of others differ in the way their brains process music, according to one study. The researchers found that those with higher empathy process familiar music with greater involvement of the reward system of the brain, as well as in areas responsible for processing social information. “High-empathy and low-empathy people share a lot in common when listening to music, including roughly equivalent involvement in the regions of the brain related to auditory, emotion, and sensory-motor processing,” said lead author Zachary Wallmark, an assistant professor in the SMU Meadows School of the Arts. But there is at least one significant difference. Highly empathic people process familiar music with greater involvement of the brain’s social circuitry, such as the areas activated when feeling empathy for others. They also seem to experience a greater degree of pleasure in listening, as indicated by increased activation of the reward system. “This may indicate that music is being perceived weakly as a kind of social entity, as an imagined or virtual human presence,” Wallmark said. Researchers in 2014 reported that about 20 percent of the population is highly empathic. These are people who are especially sensitive and respond strongly to social and emotional stimuli. This SMU-UCLA study is the first to find evidence supporting a neural account of the music-empathy connection. Also, it is among the first to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore how empathy affects the way we perceive music. The  study indicates that among higher-empathy people, at least, music is not solely a form of artistic expression. “If music was not related to how we process the social world, then we likely would have seen no significant difference in the brain activation between high-empathy and low-empathy people,” said Wallmark, who is director of the MuSci Lab at SMU, an interdisciplinary research collective that studies—among other things—how music affects the brain. “This tells us that over and above appreciating music as high art, music is about humans interacting with other humans and trying to understand and communicate with each other,” he said. This may seem obvious. “But in our culture we have a whole elaborate system of music education and music thinking that treats music as a sort of disembodied object of aesthetic contemplation,” Wallmark said. “In contrast, the results of our study help explain how music connects us to others. This could have implications for how we understand the function of music in our world, and possibly in our evolutionary past.” The researchers reported their findings in the peer-reviewed journal , in the article “Neurophysiological effects of trait empathy in music listening.” “The study shows on one hand the power of empathy in modulating music perception, a phenomenon that reminds us of the original roots of the concept of empathy—’feeling into’ a piece of art,” said senior author Marco Iacoboni, a neuroscientist at the UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior. “On the other hand,” Iacoboni said, “the study shows the power of music in triggering the same complex social processes at work in the brain that are at play during human social interactions.” Participants were 20 UCLA undergraduate students. They were each scanned in an MRI machine while listening to excerpts of music that were either familiar or unfamiliar to them, and that they either liked or disliked. The familiar music was selected by participants prior to the scan. Afterward each person completed a standard questionnaire to assess individual differences in empathy—for example, frequently feeling sympathy for others in distress, or imagining oneself in another’s shoes. The researchers then did controlled comparisons to see which areas of the brain during music listening are correlated with empathy. Analysis of the brain scans showed that high empathizers experienced more activity in the dorsal striatum, part of the brain’s reward system, when listening to familiar music, whether they liked the music or not. The reward system is related to pleasure and other positive emotions. Malfunction of the area can lead to addictive behaviors. In addition, the brain scans of higher empathy people in the study also recorded greater activation in medial and lateral areas of the prefrontal cortex that are responsible for processing the social world, and in the temporoparietal junction, which is critical to analyzing and understanding others’ behaviors and intentions. Typically, those areas of the brain are activated when people are interacting with, or thinking about, other people. Observing their correlation with empathy during music listening might indicate that music to these listeners functions as a proxy for a human encounter. Beyond analysis of the brain scans, the researchers also looked at purely behavioral data— answers to a survey asking the listeners to rate the music afterward. Those data also indicated that higher empathy people were more passionate in their musical likes and dislikes, such as showing a stronger preference for unfamiliar music. A large body of research has focused on the cognitive neuroscience of empathy—how we understand and experience the thoughts and emotions of other people. Studies point to a number of areas of the prefrontal, insular, and cingulate cortices as being relevant to what brain scientists refer to as social cognition. Activation of the social circuitry in the brain varies from individual to individual. People with more empathic personalities show increased activity in those areas when performing socially relevant tasks, including watching a needle penetrating skin, listening to non-verbal vocal sounds, observing emotional facial expressions, or seeing a loved one in pain. In the field of music psychology, a number of recent studies have suggested that empathy is related to intensity of emotional responses to music, listening style, and musical preferences—for example, empathic people are more likely to enjoy sad music. “This study contributes to a growing body of evidence,” Wallmark said, “that music processing may piggyback upon cognitive mechanisms that originally evolved to facilitate social interaction.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/highly-empathetic-process-music-differently-smu/
"Stories about sled dogs hauling medicine and supplies through the frozen wilderness have become the stuff of legends, but did you know pups are proving just as powerful in the waves as they are on the ice? In Italy, an elite squadron of 350 specially-trained canines from the (Scuola Italiana Cani Salvataggio, or ) has successfully been patrolling the beaches, working as lifeguards. 300 SICS units, consisting of one dog and one trainer, are tasked with watching over approximately 30 of the country’s busiest beaches. Thanks to their willingness to perform, strength, and fearless exploits—including leaping from helicopters into the surf below to rescue at-risk swimmers—an average of 20-30 lives are saved annually by the doggie guards, and that number continues to climb each year. Earlier this month, when several families, including eight children, were imperiled by strong wind and wave conditions while 330 feet from shore, three canine lifeguards and their trainers rushed in to save the day. With the help of their human companions, dogs Eros, Mya, and Mira pulled everyone to safety in about 15 minutes. The SICS program is the brainchild of 59-year-old Ferruccio Pilenga, who got the idea that dogs would make excellent lifeguards back in 1989 from watching his own Newfoundland, an immensely powerful swimmer named Mas. “He pulled a water-filled dinghy with three people on board for half an hour,” Pilenga told . “A human cannot do that.” The SICS program is an arduous one. After 18 months of basic training, only those dogs successfully completing the required steps are deemed ready to move on to the more intensive aspects of lifesaving techniques, such as jumping from helicopters and leaping from speeding boats. SICS teams are recognized for being especially effective in the face of large-scale life or death scenarios. Thanks to their special training, they’re better able to carry out the simultaneous rescue of multiple swimmers in situations where the capabilities of one or two lifeguards might be easily overwhelmed. “To be able to use a dog in a water rescue mission gives the rescuer a leg up. The rescuer who operates on his own is alone. We are never alone. We are always in a team with our dog so it’s a six-legged unit. I can conserve my energy and become a more effective rescuer,” Plienga told . “To make [people] understand, I always say, ‘To pull a sled, it takes at least six dogs, to pull six people, you only need one dog.’” While the success of the program can be partially attributed to the dogs’ acutely attuned survival instincts that help them find the safest route to shore, as well as their stamina and ability to follow commands, Pilenga believes the emotional component they bring to their work cannot be underestimated. “The presence of the dogs helps to lighten up the situation. The biggest reward is the emotion that the dog and the owner feel at the moment of the rescue, which further unites that special bond between dog and human.” Italy is currently the only country to recognize certified canine lifeguards, but training centers are being set up for dogs in the U.S., Germany, Switzerland, and the Azores, with SICS eager to spread its safety net to encompass wider waters across the world.

"You can find a little bit of everything at Walmart from produce and groceries to lingerie, big-screen TVs, and auto parts. For one very lucky mutt, if you know where to look, you can also find your misplaced human friend. When Abby the dog disappeared in Dothan, Alabama, all she left behind was her collar and an empty tie-out line. June Rountree and her husband scoured the neighborhood door-to-door, searching for their missing 4-year-old black-and-white fur baby to no avail. Three weeks passed and there was no sign of Abby, then something extraordinary happened. June was working the weekend shift at the Walmart register when she heard a rumpus. Somehow, a dog had gotten loose in the store and was artfully dodging the would-be shoppers and staff trying to corral her as she careened through the various departments. “I was like, ‘What in the world is happening?’” customer service associate Danielle Robinette told . When the dog arrived at June’s post, register No. 6, it was clear she wasn’t checking out, she was checking . Although June could scarcely believe it, the dashing doggo in line with 10 items or less was her long-absent Abby. “I called her name and she came to me,” Rountree told WaPo. “I bent over and hugged her. I completely lost it then. I couldn’t speak. I was in complete shock and just couldn’t believe it.” No-one is sure where Abby was for the three weeks she went AWOL, but for a dog that had been on its own three weeks she was in remarkably good shape. The Rountrees believe someone must have been feeding her even if they were unable to catch her, and they’re truly grateful for that. There’s also speculation that since June had been with Abby in the Walmart parking lot a few times, the dog might have recognized the location when she happened upon it in her travels. Whether Abby was prompted to brave the superstore’s threshold in search of food, shelter, or something else is anyone’s guess, but we’d like to think the canny canine followed her hunting instincts on a hunch that June would be inside. While we’re not sure what aisle Walmart generally stocks happy reunions on, we think it’s safe to say when Abby left the store to go home with her mom, she was one somely satisfied customer.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/dog-missing-walmart-danielle-robinette/
"A provider of solar and battery power systems is set to outfit refrigeration trucks with solar paneled roofs that would cut emissions while keeping cool 1,000 trailers full of food. The transporting of tons of food to local supermarkets are normally cooled by diesel fuel. Idling diesel tractors burn about a gallon of fuel every hour while releasing more than 22 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Under the terms of a new agreement, XL Fleet will supply battery and power electronics systems for the first 1,000 units of eNow’s new electrified refrigerated trailer solutions. XL Fleet’s mission is to help corporations and their fleets lower operating costs while helping them achieve their green goals. eNow’s solar systems capture the sun’s energy with roof mounted solar modules, and then store the energy in auxiliary batteries used to power lift gates, in-cab air conditioning, refrigeration and lighting. : Approximately 50,000 new diesel-powered refrigerated trailers are sold annually in the U.S., and XL Fleet’s partnership with eNow accelerates a sustainable all-electric solution. XL Fleet and eNow are collaborating on the design and development of the system, especially an integrated lithium-ion battery and power electronics technology that will be installed underfloor on the Class 8 trailers, providing approximately 12 hours or more of run time between charges. Solar panels mounted on the roof of the trailer will be used for charging of the batteries and powering systems when idling or during loading and unloading of the trailer. The system will be equipped with a thermal management system to enable year-round operation across North America. They can be hauled by traditional internal combustion engine or electrified tractors, as a way for fleet managers to immediately and significantly reduce emissions.

"The internet makes it easy for criminals to reach out from anywhere to illegally obtain your money or personal data—and a retired police officer is pointing out some of the most dubious ways scammers use smart phones to trick innocent people. Dave has spoken directly with hundreds of scammers in an attempt to understand what they do, so he can help the public avoid falling prey to their frauds. Their ploys are varied, and sophisticated enough to be convincing even to the most savvy people. Dave, who resides in Canada, received a call from a number disguised as if it were a local caller. When he answered, a voice told him that he was in trouble unless he spoke with a government agent about his bank account. The caller pretended to be with the investigations department of Service Canada. In this case, the scammer told Dave that his accounts were connected with serious crimes. In the US, many scammers identify themselves as being with the FBI. The scammer even set up a fake call with a local police officer, while he waited on hold. : Together, the thieving tag-team explained that Dave’s money needed to be moved to a secure government account. Dave’s advice is that you should never engage with these scammers. One correct piece of data, even a first name or your correct city, can be used with your phone number to find you on social media and gather even more information. If the call seems real, ask for a name and then hang up. Use a different phone to call the agency or bank directly to verify the caller’s identity. Always look up a bank or police department number yourself, instead of dialing one provided by the caller. Police will never call somebody on the phone to threaten arrest. Your bank will never call and ask you to divulge information. And government agencies will not call you to help you secure your funds. Sometimes, scammers will hijack your phone and your verification call to any number will be rerouted to them without you knowing it was done. If you understand the scam and you refuse to provide any information or follow any instructions, you will be less likely to ever be the victim of one of these scams.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/retired-officer-engages-with-scammers-to-expose-schemes/
"Our partner Rob Brezsny provides his weekly wisdom to enlighten our thinking and motivate our mood. Rob’s , is a syndicated weekly column appearing in over a hundred publications. He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): According to Leo author , “We are in the habit of using our eyes only with the memory of what people before us have thought about the things we are looking at.” That’s too bad. It causes us to miss a lot of life’s richness. In fact, said de Maupassant, “There is an element of the unexplored in everything. The smallest thing contains a little of what is unknown.” Your assignment in the next two weeks, Leo, is to take his thoughts to heart. In every experience, engage “with enough attention to find an aspect of it that no one has ever seen or spoken of.” You are in a phase when you could discover and enjoy record-breaking levels of novelty. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Poet wrote a poem I want you to know about. She described how, when she was a child, she stayed up all night picking peaches from her father’s orchard by starlight. For hours, she climbed up and down the ladder. Her hands “twisted fruit” as if she “were entering a thousand doors.” When the stars faded and morning arrived, her insides felt like “the stillness a bell possesses just after it has been rung.” That’s the kind of experience I wish for you in the coming days, Virgo. I know it can’t be exactly the same. Can you imagine what the nearest equivalent might be? Make it happen! LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Ancient Greek philosopher mistrusted laughter, poetry, bright colors, and artists who used bright colors. All those soulful activities influenced people to be emotional, Plato thought, and therefore represented a threat to rational, orderly society. Wow! I’m glad I don’t live in a culture descended from Plato! Oh, wait, I do. His writing is foundational to Western thought. One modern philosopher declared, “The European philosophical tradition consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.” Anyway, I’m counseling you to rebel against Plato in the coming weeks. You especially need experiences that awaken and please and highlight your feelings. Contrary to Plato’s fears, doing this will boost your intelligence and enhance your decision-making powers. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): A biography of Nobel Prize-winning Scorpio author noted that he had two modes. They are summed up in the French words (“unity”) and (“solitary”). When Camus was in a phase, he immersed himself in convivial engagement, enjoying the pleasures of socializing. But when he decided it was time to work hard on writing his books, he retreated into a monastic routine to marshal intense creativity. According to my astrological analysis, you Scorpios are currently in the phase of your rhythm. Enjoy it to the max! When might the next phase come? October could be such a time. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): During the 76 years since the end of World War II, Italy has had 69 different governments. That’s a great deal of turnover! Is it a strength or weakness to have so many changes in leadership? On the one hand, such flexibility could be an asset; it might be wise to keep reinventing the power structure as circumstances shift. On the other hand, having so little continuity and stability may undermine confidence and generate stressful uncertainty. I bring this to your attention, Sagittarius, because you’re entering a phase when you could be as changeable as Italy. Is that what you want? Would it serve you or undermine you? Make a conscious choice. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Capricorn actor Nicholas Browne testifies, “My heart is too full; it overflows onto everything I see. I am drowning in my own heart. I’ve plunged into the deepness of emotion, and I don’t see any way back up. Still, I pray no one comes to save me.” I’m guessing that his profound capacity to feel and express emotions serves Browne well in his craft. While I don’t recommend such a deep immersion for you 24/7/365, I suspect you’ll be wise to embark on such an excursion during the next three weeks. Have fun diving! How deep can you go? AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): In accordance with current astrological omens, I’m calling on author to offer you a message. Is it infused with tough love or sweet encouragement? Both! Here’s Katie: “When you realize that suffering and discomfort are the call to inquiry, you may actually begin to look forward to uncomfortable feelings. You may even experience them as friends coming to show you what you have not yet investigated thoroughly enough.” Get ready to dive deeper than you’ve dared to go before, Aquarius. I guarantee you it will ultimately become fun and educational. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): In August 1922, author wrote this triumphant declaration: “All day today I’ve had the most gentle, quivering joy, because I’m beginning to heal. Consciously, happily, I feel that I am being born anew, that I am beginning once again to take possession of the light.” On behalf of the cosmic powers-that-be, I authorize you to use these words as your own in the coming weeks. They capture transformations that are in the works for you. By speaking Kazantzakis’s declarations aloud several times every day, you will ensure that his experience will be yours, too. ARIES (March 21-April 19): “Consecrate” isn’t a word you often encounter in intellectual circles. In my home country of America, many otherwise smart people spurn the possibility that we might want to make things sacred. And a lot of art aspires to do the opposite of consecration: strip the world of holiness and mock the urge to commune with sanctified experiences. But filmmaker (1922–1975) expressed a contradictory view. He wrote, “I am not interested in deconsecrating: that’s a fashion I hate. I want to reconsecrate things as much as possible, I want to re-mythicize them.” In accordance with astrological omens, Aries, I invite you to look for opportunities to do the same. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Anais Nin wrote, “I don’t want worship. I want understanding.” George Orwell said, “Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.” Poet Marina Tsvetaeva declared, “For as long as I can remember, I thought I wanted to be loved. Now I know: I don’t need love, I need understanding.” Here’s what I’ll add, Taurus: If you ask for understanding and seek it out, a wealth of it will be available to you in the coming weeks. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): The English idiom “playing hard to get” means “pretending to be unavailable or uninterested so as to make oneself more attractive or desirable.” Psychologists say this strategy often works, although it’s crucial not to go too far and make your pursuer lose interest. 17th-century philosopher expressed the concept more philosophically. He said, “Leave people hungry. Even with physical thirst, good taste’s trick is to stimulate it, not quench it. What’s good, if sparse, is twice as good. A surfeit of pleasure is dangerous, for it occasions disdain even towards what’s undisputedly excellent. Hard-won happiness is twice as enjoyable.” I suggest you consider deploying these strategies, Gemini. CANCER (June 21-July 22): Painter John Singer Sargent sometimes worked alongside painter Claude Monet at Monet’s home. He sought the older man’s guidance. Before their first session, Sargent realized there was no black among the paint colors Monet gave him to work with. What?! Monet didn’t use black? Sargent was shocked. He couldn’t imagine painting without it. And yet, he did fine without it. In fact, the apparent limitation compelled him to be creative in ways he hadn’t previously imagined. What would be your metaphorical equivalent, Cancerian: a limitation that inspires?

"This funny video shows Wally the Walrus appearing to drive a boat he clambered into during his latest escapade. Wally has has been filmed ‘steering’ a motorboat along the Irish coast as he continues to make a nuisance of himself. The lonely walrus has been on a 2,500 mile solo trip for months and recently spent more than six weeks off Cornwall. Wally is believed to be from Svalbard, north of Norway, and to have travelled by himself between Wales, England, and France. But the wandering walrus has now made a home for himself off the Irish coast. And recent footage shows Wally seemingly cruising along the coast on a luxury motorboat belonging to Clonakilty Distillery in West Cork. Posting the video online, the distillery said: “One of our team had an unexpected Arctic visitor on their boat this evening. “Wally the walrus spotted in Clonakilty today… We reckon he must have stopped by on his travels for a refreshing Minke G&T.” The boat is ordinarily used to forage for rock samphire, a botanical used in gin production. The large sea mammal, thought to be around four years old, has reportedly sunk one small boat and damaged several others on his visit to Cork. It was first seen in Ireland before taking up residence in Tenby, Pembrokeshire in March. Seal Rescue Ireland has now launched an appeal for a pontoon or other floating platform for Wally to use as a “safe, designated haul-out site” for him to rest on undisturbed. The charity said: “We are looking for a pontoon/floating platform as a safe haul-out site for the Walrus, so that he can be effectively monitored, protected from disturbance, and damage to property prevented. “As a Pinniped (like seals and sea lions), Walruses are semi-aquatic, which means they must come up on land (or a floating object) to rest. Such a pontoon would be similar to one built for the walrus during his time on the Isles of Scilly. The BDMLR and St Mary’s Harbour Authority constructed a specific customized pontoon replicating his apparent need for physical contact.

"Once the largest steel mill in the world, the Sparrows Point shipyard in Maryland will provide new jobs in Baltimore as a manufacturer of wind turbine parts. The United Steelworkers union (USW) announced this month that it will partner with US Wind as it transforms the former steel mill into a manufacturing facility supporting the growth of offshore wind energy. US Wind plans to use the site to make the monopile foundations needed for their offshore wind developments, including their maiden MarWin project consisting of 22-turbines. The union has pledged to work with the company to recruit and train local workers, while supporting workers’ rights to unionize and collectively bargain. : “The loss of the Sparrows Point steel mill, which once employed thousands of workers, was a huge blow to the Baltimore community and to U.S. manufacturing as a whole,” USW International President Tom Conway. “Now, we have a chance to create the jobs of the future right here on this historic site and ensure that they are good, union jobs that will again support families across this region.” Catalyzed by a , the plant is expected to support more than 500 permanent jobs, as well as 3,500 construction jobs to prepare the site. Welcoming steel back to the storied Sparrows Point site is truly a full-circle moment that shareholders hope will create a ripple effect of jobs and prosperity to power Maryland’s post-COVID economy. : “Sparrows Point has always been hallowed ground for me and my fellow Steelworkers,” said USW’s Jim Strong. “We’re thrilled to be a part of US Wind’s visionary plans to bring steel back to Baltimore, back to this hallowed ground.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/former-sparrows-point-steel-mill-to-make-wind-turbines/
"“Nutritious ancestral plant of the Mayans, its flowers a treasure, a small but powerful grain; eat the leaf and the grain, which is ideal for roasting and making popcorn.” This brief description, on a website translated from Spanish, belittles the grand potential and grander history of a humble but potential superfood that could replace nutrient-deficient grains across the developing world. The first growers of the grain called amaranth were the always ahead-of-their-time Mayan peoples of Central and South America. It was also cultivated by the Aztecs. When Spanish conquerors  arrived in the 1600s, they threatened anyone seen growing amaranth, because the spiritual connection they had to the plant was thought to undermine Christianity, according to a recent article in Now free from such persecution, the ancestors of Mesoamerican peoples across Latin America are bringing this once-common crop to the attention of the world’s markets. A source of all nine essential amino acids, as well as several key minerals like iron and magnesium, amaranth is a pseudo-cereal, lying somewhere between a seed and grain, like buckwheat or quinoa—and, . Additionally, it’s now being grown and marketed in high-end products for the , and health food stores, in far-flung places like South Asia, China, India, West Africa, and the Caribbean. With nearly 75 species in the Amaranthus genus, some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables, some for grain, and some for ornamental plants that you may have planted in your garden. : Densely packed flower clusters and stems grow in a range of striking pigments, from maroon and crimson to ochre and lime, and can grow from 3 to 8 feet tall. Some of them are summer annual weeds, commonly referred to as pigweeds. The total value, since the 1970s when amaranth first began appearing on the shelves of stores, has ballooned into a global trade that’s now valued at $5.8 billion. And, one Pueblo woman from New Mexico thinks it has the potential to feed the entire world. Much of the revival of traditional amaranth cultivation methods, which involve saving the seeds of the best plants, similar to corn cultivation by Mexico’s have created a seriously-resilient crop. A from the detailing the rise of weeds resistant to the Monsanto herbicide “Roundup,” explained that amaranth, considered a weed by some, displayed such resistance. Organizations like Qachoo Aluum in Guatemala, a Mayan word for Mother Earth, , and host workshops to help indigenous communities regain food security through ancestral methods of cultivation. Regain is a key word here because, as article details, government forces had been persecuting the Mayan population and burning their fields. Farmers kept amaranth seeds in secret jars buried underground, and when the two-decade war ended, the remaining agriculturalists began to spread the seed, and the growing methods, across the countryside. : Qachoo Aluum rose from the ashes of this conflict, thanks to more than 400 families from 24 Guatemalan villages, who have been traveling every year to the United States to share their ancestral knowledge about the crop to predominantly indigenous and Latin-language garden centers. “Amaranth has completely changed the lives of families in our communities, not only economically, but spiritually,” said Maria Aurelia Xitumul, a Mayan descendent and member of the Qachoo Aluum community since 2006. The interchange of seeds—a vital part of healthy ag systems, has revived friendly connections between the Guatemalan Qachoo Aluum and their New Mexican Pueblo relatives. : “We’ve always viewed our seed relatives as and kin,” said Tsosie-Peña, who believes the resilient, nutritious plant can feed the world. A perfect plant for drought-prone regions, amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development, and support sustainable land care.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/amaranth-health-trend-that-could-feed-world/
"Most of us remember a time when we could eat anything we wanted and not gain weight. But a new study suggests your metabolism—the rate at which you burn calories—actually starts its inevitable decline much later than we all assumed. Additionally, we tend to think of our teens and 20s as the age when our calorie-burning potential hits its peak. But the researchers found that, pound for pound, infants had the highest metabolic rates of all. Duke University associate professor Herman Pontzer joined an international team of scientists to analyze the average calories burned by more than 6,600 people ranging in age from one week to 95 as they went about their daily lives in 29 countries worldwide. Focusing on puberty, menopause, and other phases of life, Pontzer, the study’s co-author was surprised. “What’s weird is that the timing of our ‘metabolic life stages’ doesn’t seem to match those typical milestones.” Previously, most large-scale studies measured how much energy the body uses to perform basic vital functions such as breathing, digesting, pumping blood—in other words, the calories you need just to stay alive. But that amounts to only 50% to 70% of the calories we burn each day. It doesn’t take into account the energy we spend doing everything else: washing the dishes, walking the dog, breaking a sweat at the gym, even just thinking or fidgeting. To come up with a number for total daily energy expenditure, the researchers relied on the “doubly labeled water” method. It’s a urine test that involves having a person drink water in which the hydrogen and oxygen in the water molecules have been replaced with naturally occurring “heavy” forms, and then measuring how quickly they’re flushed out. Scientists have used the technique—considered the gold standard for measuring daily energy expenditure during normal daily life, outside of the lab— to measure energy expenditure in humans since the 1980s, but studies have been limited in size and scope due to cost. So multiple labs decided to share their data and gather their measurements in a single database, to see if they could tease out truths that weren’t revealed or were only hinted at in previous work. Pooling and analyzing energy expenditures across the entire lifespan revealed some surprises, including the data showing that babies have the highest metabolic rates of all. During the first 12 months of an infant’s life, their energy needs shoot upward, such that by their first birthday, a one-year-old burns calories 50% faster for their body size than an adult. And that’s not just because, in their first year, infants are busy tripling their birth weight. “Of course they’re growing, but even once you control for that, their energy expenditures are rocketing up higher than you’d expect for their body size and composition,” said Pontzer, author of a book on the science of metabolism, . An infant’s gas-guzzling metabolism may partly explain why children who don’t get enough to eat during this developmental window are less likely to survive and grow up to be healthy adults. “Something is happening inside a baby’s cells to make them more active, and we don’t know what those processes are yet,” Pontzer said. After this initial surge in infancy, the data show that metabolism slows by about 3% each year until we reach our 20s, when it levels off into a new normal. Despite the teen years being a time of growth spurts, the researchers didn’t see any uptick in daily calorie needs in adolescence after they took body size into account. “We really thought puberty would be different and it’s not,” said Pontzer. : Midlife was another surprise. Perhaps you’ve been told that it’s all downhill after 30 when it comes to your weight. But while several factors could explain the thickening waistlines that often emerge during our prime working years, the findings suggest that a changing metabolism isn’t one of them. In fact, the researchers discovered that energy expenditures during these middle decades—our 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s—were the most stable. Even during pregnancy, a woman’s calorie needs were no more or less than expected given her added bulk as the baby grows. The data suggest that our metabolisms don’t really start to decline again until after age 60. The slowdown is gradual, only 0.7% a year. But a person in their 90s needs 26% fewer calories each day than someone in midlife. : Lost muscle mass as we get older may be partly to blame, the researchers say, since muscle burns more calories than fat. But it’s not the whole picture. “We controlled for muscle mass,” Pontzer said. “It’s because their cells are slowing down.” The patterns held even when differing activity levels were taken into account, according to the research, which was published August 12 in and funded by the National Science Foundation and IAEA. For a long time, what drives shifts in energy expenditure has been difficult to parse because aging goes hand in hand with so many other changes, Pontzer said. But the research lends support to the idea that it’s more than age-related changes in lifestyle or body composition. “All of this points to the conclusion that tissue metabolism, the work that the cells are doing, is changing over the course of the lifespan in ways we haven’t fully appreciated before,” Pontzer said. “You really need a big data set like this to get at those questions.” (Source: ) – File photo by Emma Simpson",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/metabolism-does-not-slow-down-in-midlife-adulthood/
"A serendipitous series of events turned an 11-year-old boy into a stalwart hero, after a dying man gave him a tent. Last year, just before the pandemic reached the UK, Max Woosey’s parents were helping to care for a neighbor, Rick Abbott, who had terminal cancer. They came to appreciate how vital it was that the local hospice in North Devon was able to help their neighbor remain in his own home, which was his final wish. Just before he died, Abbott gave Max a gift. “My friend Rick gave me his tent before he died and made me promise to go have an adventure.” Max realized that most of the fundraising for the hospice was cancelled and services were closed due to COVID-19, so on March 29th, 2020, he began sleeping in his new tent pitched in the backyard, hoping to raise £100 for the hospice. With his plush stuffed animals to keep him cozy, he posted updates on his fundraising page, while waiting for the pandemic to be over. As lockdown restrictions dragged on, and warm summer nights turned into chilly autumn frost, Max refused to come in from the cold—and . On October 12, he wrote, “Thank you so much for all the donations. I can’t believe how much I have raised. I have decided to camp out for a year to see if I can get to £20,000.” The boy blew past that goal, hitting milestones of 100 consecutive days, then 200 days, then 300 days. : His dog Digby was more than welcome to spend the night and keep this Cub Scout warm through the nights. During one December storm, his tent blew over but he repitched it so he could cross-off another day on his calendar. His dad kept him company during Storm Bella and its 70mph winds. He even had to get a new tent when the first one sprung a leak. When Christmas season arrived, the family decorated his tent with lights and santa ornaments.

"In the latest audio survey of kiwi bird populations on New Zealand’s North Island, many areas that were silent in 2016 now have airways filled to bursting with kiwi calls. The male’s high shriek contrasts with the females low growl, but regardless of which sound it was—the early morning hours in December, when the last survey was made, were filled with stifled cries of joy from 150 volunteer bird conservationists. The manual population survey, called the Kiwi Call Count, uses the human ear to record population numbers of the nation’s five kiwi species to assess the status of the birds in a given area. The same sites are used every year, and 2021 saw a 50% increase in the number of sites in which calls were heard, while not one site had become silent over the last year. A complex kiwi-saving action plan to combat invasive species was implemented to protect the national bird . Stoats, dogs, feral cats, and other introduced mammals have flourished on the easily caught kiwi chicks, a species that evolved with no native mammalian predators. “To sit out there and hear how many kiwi there are and how close they are—it makes the effort put into trapping worthwhile,” Ayla Wiles, a biodiversity ranger for the Department of Conservation, told This trapping has been hugely successful, and —the northern brown and the rowi, waddled off the Endangered designation on the IUCN’s Red List. Wiles told reporters that some areas are seeing more of a sprint than a waddle. A place called Whangerei Heads has gone from having 80 kiwi to more than 1,000 since the program began. As a nocturnal bird, the call of the kiwi is the most reliable way to track the animals. The calls are easy to discern in the darkness, and even have unique characteristics that allow conservationists to recognize the same birds year after year. “You can be trapping, you know, week after week after week, in the hope that your kiwi are doing well,” said Ngaire Sullivan, an organizer . “And then for four nights a year, for just those eight hours… You sit there and get to hear your outcome.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/kiwi-numbers-grow-50-after-latest-audio-survye/
"If in mid-summer you went onto the top of the Grocery Outlet supermarket in Stockton, California, and placed your hand on the strange, glossy black panels you found there, you’d be shocked to find they were as cold to the touch as a basement fuse box. Installed by a company called SkyCool Systems, they are the first of a new breed of cooling technologies that radiate heat out through the atmosphere, lowering nearby air temperatures by about 10°F. Radiative cooling is what happens when the electromagnetic waves we call heat leave an object. It’s the phenomenon that puts you at risk for heat stroke in the desert during the day, and hypothermia at night; the absorbed heat evacuates the landscape at sundown, and without any moisture to trap it, leaves through Earth’s atmosphere into outer space. A UCLA scientist reasoned that if a certain spectrum of warming rays is radiated out to the atmosphere during the day, it would cool whatever it left, potentially offering an alternative to traditional air conditioning. An estimated 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions are generated through cooling systems, both for homes and transport, but as global temperatures continue to climb, the use of cooling systems for homes and businesses is expected to triple over the coming years. can absorb all the heat-producing light from the sun, and rather than sending it back into the swirling cauldron of gasses that are heating the planet, expels it out into space. Aaswath Raman, a materials scientists at the University of California LA, discovered that radiative cooling technologies like panels and special reflective paints had been investigated before but then abandoned as impossible. The idea was that if something could radiate heat even in broad daylight, it could save thousands in refrigeration costs. Raman decided to submit a funding proposal to the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, a branch of the Department of Energy. Despite the quilt of material and all the water vapor and CO2 that make up the atmosphere, infrared radiation between 8 to 13 micrometers in length passes through it as if it weren’t there, so Raman aimed to creative a film that reflected visible light, and which radiated the infrared light which can leave the atmosphere, ensuring the heat he disperses doesn’t become someone else’s problem. With colleagues from the Stanford engineering department led by Shanhui Fan, he created an ultra-thin film, which he says could be produced in rolls a meter long by two-meters wide, made of silica, glass, and hafnium dioxide, a coating agent used in the optics industry. Placed on a rooftop, became warmer when shaded from the sun’s rays—a counter-intuitive reaction to what one would expect, because the radiation was impeded by the material generating the shade. Furthermore, under the blazing summer sun, the panel was cool to the touch. If placed on the hood of a car, the film would not only reflect any light from the sun, but radiate away some of the heat from the engine; if placed above where water pipes run through a building, it would cool the water therein, reducing the load on air-conditioning systems. After a trip to Mumbai in India revealed the speed at which the home A/C market is growing, Raman needed to ensure the panels and film would be cheap enough to be employed in developing countries near the tropics, where they’re needed most. In Stockton, the Grocery Outlet supermarket spent $40,000 on refrigeration per year between their freezer isles and the deli. SkyCool panels placed on the roof and is now saving about $5,800 in costs per year. that Raman and SkyCool Systems have gone in search of grant money to replace all the air conditioners in a school as part of a project to see if their special film can itself be the principle cooling agent of a building, while National Geographic adds that some scientists have created if only 1.5% of the world were covered in these panels, and that they could be maintained over a long enough period, it would reflect all the additional heat created by the climate crisis.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/professor-develops-technology-that-cools-people-down-without-electricity-or-ac/
"Although it may not number amongst the seven ancient wonders of the world, the 4,600-year-old solar boat belonging to Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu is an amazing marvel of the ancient world nonetheless. Last week, King Khufu’s reassembled solar craft was moved intact to its new permanent location, the Grand Egyptian Museum, where it’s sure to become a feature attraction among the museum’s reported 100,000 artifacts when the venue opens to the public later this year. Under the supervision of a team of engineers and archeologists, after being secured in a specially built, shock-absorbing container, the craft was ferried via a remote-controlled all-terrain vehicle for the five-mile, 10-hour journey from Giza to Cairo. King Khufu ruled Egypt during the Fourth Dynasty (circa 2613 to 2494 BCE). In 1954, Egyptian archaeologist Kamal el-Mallakh uncovered the remains of the cedar-wood barque buried outside Khufu’s royal tomb in the Pyramid of Cheops (a.k.a., the Great Pyramid), the largest of the three pyramids at Giza. The craft itself was no longer intact when el-Mallakh made the discovery, however, having rested for centuries in a tightly sealed chamber, the wood from which it was built remained in surprisingly good condition. Archaeologists toiled more than 20 months to painstakingly excavate the boat’s 1,224 component fragments. Using methods as historically accurate as possible to those by which the ship was originally built, it was almost another 10 years before a crew of researchers and restorers were able to piece the puzzle back together. Solar boats containing burial chambers were patterned after the mythical Barque of Ra, the Egyptian god revered as the embodiment of the Sun as it sailed the heavens from dawn to dusk each day. While historians are unclear whether this particular boat was part of Khufu’s working fleet or was built to facilitate the pharaoh’s ascension from the mortal to the immortal plain, it was common practice to outfit Pharaohs’ tombs with what the Egyptians believed to be the essentials of the afterlife—including transportation. As reported by , The aim of the recent transportation project was “to protect and preserve the biggest and oldest organic artifact made of wood in the history of humanity for future generations,” Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in a statement. And while that might not exactly be immortality, it’s still a pretty fine legacy indeed.

"“It’s hard not to be romantic about baseball,” said Brad Pitt’s character in the film —and this story unfolding last week on an Iowa farm is a great example. For those lucky enough to have watched Kevin Costner’s enduring classic as a young boy or girl signed up for little league, the sight of Costner and the real-life Yankees and White Sox walking through the corn stalks onto a regulation size baseball diamond to play an actual Major League Baseball game is, well, ‘perfect.’ The first-place Chicago White Sox faced the New York Yankees adjacent to the corn field in Dyersville, where the iconic film was shot—and it was the first MLB league game Appearing from a stretch of mature corn beyond the warning track in right field, Costner— who has a great baseball arm and threw his own pitches in movies like and led the two teams onto the field in the video below, to rousing applause before throwing the first pitch at the game. “Build it and they will come,” goes the famous line in the film, and indeed thousands of MLB fans from around the country showed up to watch on this perfect occasion. Randy Peterson, writing for the recapped the thoughts of Yankees manager Aaron Boone after their team lost, 9-8. “That’s probably the greatest setting for a baseball game that I’ve ever been a part of.” One of the fans commented, “I was in attendance and it was by far the best sporting event I ever attended. MLB hit a home run on this!” “(The) coolest part was, in order to get to the game you had to enter through the corn in center field on the original field” “Everything was just so well planned out.” James Earle Jones starred in the movie as author Terrance Mann, and, now 90-years-old, he honored the project by contributing his famous deep voice to read the Fox pre-game teaser. Sports Illustrated detailed how refreshing it was to watch a ballgame without the endless inter-inning pageantry, advertisements on the jumbotron, constant requests to “make some noise,” and blaring music. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said the game will be back next year, likely featuring the Reds and the Cubs, cementing another special date in the MLB calendar, alongside the All-Star Game, Homerun Derby, and Post Season. “It does feel like all the teams are going to want to touch this,” Costner told . “There’s going to be hot competition to play here. There’s going to be records set here as a result of . I hope it does happen.” Maybe a record wasn’t set this time, but a riveting final inning delighted the crowd. By , Chicago was leading 7-4, after several home runs had sailed into the cornfields surrounding the park (pictured below, next to the smaller film site). In a nightmare for the otherwise-stellar pitcher Liam Hendricks, he allowed New York to wipe out that 3-run lead after a single by Tyler Wade led to a home run by Aaron Judge—Judge’s second of the game. With just three outs left in the game, the Sox were only down by one run. Seby Zavala made it to first base, and then Tim Anderson proceeded to hit a walk-off homer over the corn stalks where the teams had entered three hours earlier, sealing the win, 9-8. It’s hard not to be romantic about baseball. It was perfect; it was everything a baseball fan could want. A celebration of a simpler period in the history of America’s Pastime. Is this heaven?

"Sweeping educational reforms, aimed to reduce the sometimes crippling pressure for pupils to succeed at school, have seen end-of-year exams ended for children in China aged 6 and 7. The ban mirrors one passed earlier this year for written homework for first and second graders, and one limiting the homework burden on Junior High students to 1.5 hours per night. This reporter has worked in the Chinese private tutoring industry, and seen first-hand the pressure which the desire for a strong education has created within students, but also in parents, who will regularly work themselves to the bone in order to furnish the exorbitant tutoring costs associated with a first-class education. It was not uncommon for me to meet students who had more than 20 classes per week entirely outside the school system, and which could include music and English or French, but also private instruction based on what they went through that week in school. “Too frequent exams… which cause students to be overburdened and under huge exam pressure,” have been axed by the Ministry of Education’s reforms published on Monday. They added that the exam burden “harms their mental and physical health.” Indeed a of 43 high school students in Yunnan province found that they all saw education as a whole as nothing more than merely the passing of an examination, before the preparation for another. “This particular approach, at its worst,” the authors wrote, “can stifle a student’s imagination, creativity, and sense of self, qualities crucial for a child’s ultimate success in and out of the classroom.” The average public school classroom can be between 40 and 60 students, giving teachers very little time for individual attention. If a child cannot keep pace with the class, there are typically two options the parents can take. One option is to bribe the teacher to ensure their child is thoroughly understanding every lesson, however if some other parents have offered higher bribes, an informal bidding war can sometimes occur. The other option is to go for tutoring, which can easily cost $15,000 a year, as China has one the largest tutoring sector on Earth, worth $100 billion per year. Previously, children took yearly exams so as to prepare for the university entrance test—”the dreaded gaokao” , which can define a young person’s life trajectory. The reforms were put in place to try and close the educational gap in school, which has caused all manner of social distortions. One example is that catchment areas of good schools are highly sought after, driving the prices of real estate sky high. Another is the concentration of good teachers at good schools, as more public and private money finds its way into the coffers of schools that crank out better-testing pupils. The Party addressed this by imposing a forced rotation for teachers every six years. Far beside the one-child, and now two-child policy, the cost of school made having multiple kids economically unfeasible. Now with the slowest population growth in decades, attempts to ease the financial burden of school is seen as welcome relief to parents.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/china-bans-yearly-exams-for-students-aged-6-7/
"In Kenya, a drive through the Central Highlands will sometimes reveal a landscape covered in a beautiful white-petaled flower with a lethal secret. The yellow center of the contains one of the world’s great natural insecticides, that as well as being totally harmless to plants, humans, and animals, supports the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of rural Kenyans who supply much of the world’s pyrethrum, the principle chemical in the flower. Pyrethrum is becoming a major tool in the fight against mosquito-borne illnesses, as the toxin attacks the central nervous system of the insect, causing it to spasm around and drop still over a 30-second period. It’s also an excellent , not only for gardens and crops but livestock, who can from biting ticks and flies if a little pyrethrum is rubbed onto their neck, legs, and shoulders. Simply growing near any plants you wish to keep insect free is enough to protect them from most pests, such is the power of the pyrethrum therein. “Pyrethrin is the most important insecticide in the world,” says Joel Maina Kibett, chief agriculture officer of Nakuru County in Kenya. “It is natural, organic, and it has no environmental effects. And it is user friendly.” As chemical insecticides are responsible for around the world, declines in honeybees, and many other deleterious effects on animals, the need for mass-produced natural chemicals is high. Kenya is uniquely suited for the cultivation of the flower and the pyrethrum it produces, as its Central Highlands region provides perfect growing conditions for the flower which bursts out of the ground following Kenya’s two rainy seasons. During the 1970s and ’80s, Kenya grew nearly all the pyrethrum in the world decades after the arrival of the chrysanthemum species from Japan along with British colonizers. It became such an economic driver that it was placed in the Kenyan coat of arms following independence. After the rise of industrial agriculture and cheaper pyrethrum produced elsewhere, the entire pyrethrum farming industry in Kenya collapsed. The pyrethrum state monopoly only finished paying off debts to growers in 2018, a year after Kenya liberalized the market, encouraging competition, production, and innovation. In Kibett’s Nakuru County, 2017 saw 15,703 farming households receive seedlings from the county government and half a dozen private companies. National Geographic reports that these are already generating income for more than 100,000 rural Kenyans. “In total, we have given out 23.3 million seedlings since we started the revival of the sector,” Kibett in a special feature on pyrethrum. “Most of us became what we are because of that flower. We remember seeing beautiful landscapes covered with white sheets of flowers. We have done it before, and the results were very good. And we have the knowledge. We have the existing infrastructure.” Where before farmers sometimes had to wait months to receive payments for their deliveries, the private sector are settling up within a few days on a popular mobile payment app which in turn allows farmers to quickly pay for school and other things. Much of the pyrethrum goes to making mosquito-killing incense: coils of pyrethrum produced from dried that are popular insect repellents around the world. A University of Nairobi that pyrethrin-based insect spray managed to kill around 96% of a recent desert locust plague, a devastating phenomenon that creates unstoppable swarms of flying insects that can devour 300 million pounds of crops in a single day. Since much of the world’s pyrethrum is grown in the Horn of Africa, where locusts are such a problem, it seems like the perfect solution.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/kenya-chrysanthemum-pyrethrum-flower-industry-offers-rural-income-and-natural-insecticide/
"If you judge a city’s heart by how much they’re willing to go the extra mile even for its non-human citizens, Arlington in Texas recently proved that things really bigger in the Lone Star State. When Zoey, a 15-year-old deaf Lab mix wandered away from her home, practically the whole community turned out to help find her. “I had put on NextDoor app, we’re missing our dog… and people were like, ‘Here’s my number. Call me and I will come help you find [her],’” dog mom Andrea Tankersley told . “The difficult part is she’s deaf,” dog dad Brennan Tankersley added. “So we’re calling out to her, calling out to her, of course knowing it’s not any good but you can’t help it.” Searchers reported hearing dog sounds but were unable to figure out where they were coming from. Two days later, city water crews homing in on her echoing barks located Zoey trapped in a muddy storm drain under a city street. A water department camera was set up to monitor Zoey’s condition in the tunnel as a herculean rescue effort coordinated by Arlington’s fire department, police, paramedics, and city workers was quickly mounted to free the trapped canine. Using jackhammers, pneumatic saws, and heavy equipment, in extreme heat conditions to break up the pavement and dig down to the concrete drain pipe below. Throughout the excavation, neighbors supplied workers with food and beverages to keep them going. Nearly 10 hours later, a section of the top of the culvert was lifted away to reveal the watery channel. Once they had access, rescuers still had to come up with a way to get Zoey safely out of the confined tunnel space. When one firefighter posed the idea of rolling her out on a skateboard, a kindergartener named Hunter volunteered his board for the cause. (The skateboard, autographed by the fire and police personnel who helped out in the rescue is set to be presented back to the little boy with a big thank you from everyone involved.) At 11 hours and counting, rescuers finally pulled Zoey from the concrete pipe to cheers and applause from an elated crowd of onlookers. The pooped pooch was passed, bucket-brigade style, up to the street where waiting emergency workers assessed her and then reunited her with the Tankersleys and their kids. Amazingly, although she was scuffed up and understandably distressed, Zoey suffered no major ill effects from her ordeal, and after getting an all-clear from the vet is happy to be back home. “It has been amazing,” Police officer Kristi Weil who was on the scene told WFAA. “Everyone has been so helpful. There have been cheers of joy and tears when Zoey was rescued… I love seeing the community turn out and cheer a successful end to this—and for a family to have their beloved pet returned to them at the end of the day.” We’re glad this doggone, dog-found deep-in-the-heart-of-Texas tale had a happy ending too.

"Eight in 10 Americans believe their health is a “work in progress,” and many have been taking steps to improve their lifestyle. According to a new survey of 13,000 people in 24 countries—including 2,000 in the U.S.—this feeling isn’t unique to Americans. 82 percent of people globally felt the same (compared to 84% of Americans), and 89% of all respondents are currently taking steps to improve their health. Of those, 81% said the pandemic helped kickstart them into doing so—and these steps are having a clear impact on respondents’ health. Globally, 56% of respondents can now run or exercise longer without feeling winded, while 48% have gone down a size or a belt notch. Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of and the , the survey found the average respondent is currently working to break three unhealthy habits. Results delved into the specific small steps that respondents are taking to do so. Respondents revealed they started their journey to be healthier by exercising more, cooking/eating more nutritious foods, or downloading a fitness app. Purchasing less junk food, beginning to take walks during their lunch break, and taking vitamins or supplements were other “first steps” respondents took—or plan to take to support their health. The survey delved further into vitamins and supplements and found them to be a priority for many respondents across the globe. When asked about how their health goals have changed during the pandemic, half said they’re more focused on eating healthier, including supplementing their diet with vitamins and minerals. And of those who currently take vitamins or supplements, results revealed the average respondent spends about $286 every year. Americans were slightly above that, at an average of $304 per year. “Be it exercising, healthy cooking or including more vitamins and supplements to your routine, for many, the pandemic has provided an opportunity to improve health habits overall,” said Dr. Kent Bradley, chief health and nutrition officer at Herbalife Nutrition. “Consistency is key when one commits to a healthy lifestyle.” But while many respondents plan to incorporate more vitamins and supplements into their diet, only 69% said they feel knowledgeable about the health benefits those can offer. Thirty percent of respondents said they are most likely to get information about vitamins and supplements from internet searches, media, and social media, followed by consulting with their doctor (27%). Regardless of where they currently get information, 77% would like to know more about the nutritional benefits of different vitamins and supplements to support their health. “Being well informed about the proper use, as well as benefits of nutritional supplements, is critical as supplements can enhance every wellness journey,” said Brian Wommack, senior vice president of the Council for Responsible Nutrition.

"In battling against the American homeless epidemic, it pays to think outside the box. The Tiny Home Village in Albuquerque isn’t just a place for someone to sleep out of the weather, it’s an occupational therapy project that helps the homeless reconnect with values and responsibility. Set up to cultivate a strong community, the power of routine, and a sense of pride in oneself and surroundings, the Tiny Home Village (THV) hopes that its residents will be better prepared for when they finally get off the street. The County of Bernalillo, New Mexico, secured a 30-year lease on a property owned by the Albuquerque Indian Center to build a walled and gated community of about 30 tiny houses that had doors which lock and climate control to give residents a strong enough sense of security and permanence that they could begin to really turn their life around. Albuquerque looked at a similar project in Oregon—the , which was established back in 2013, as a model for how to encourage self-governance among the villagers, allowing them to decide among themselves how the village is to be run day by day. The two look very similar. Inside the compound there are 30 houses painted different colors, though all featuring the same layout: a desk, two chairs, bed, closet, and stoop. At the center of the THV there is the “Village House” where residents can cook, do laundry, watch television, socialize, use the internet, and access a library. “We’re trying to give the villagers some tools that would stand them in really good stead once they do move out,” Ilse Biel, the resource manager for the Albuquerque THV, told Biel would add that already, the theory is working, and the community is taking ownership of daily chores as well as holding each other accountable. “They’re house-proud; really getting upset about seeing a counter not wiped, a cigarette butt somewhere.” is a welcome replacement for the previous homeless enclave—Tent City, which sprang up near a railroad in downtown and which became so big that the people there began to chalk addresses of their tents on the street. THV is not meant to be a place of refuge, and the doors aren’t open to just anyone. Perspective residents must sign up for a $30 a month utilities fee, as well test clean of any hard drugs. They must be sober for at least 10 days prior to the date of entry, and must be willing and able to participate in village life, which will require them to do chores like de-weeding in the communal vegetable garden, cleaning bathrooms, and more. : Perhaps for these reasons, THV is not yet full. But the managers are hopeful, believing such a community must be more than a just a roof over someone’s head and instead somewhere a person can make friends, and gain the physical, spiritual, financial, and occupational strength to ensure that by the time they rejoin society they are there to stay.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/tiny-home-village-in-albuquerque-new-mexico-for-homeless-people/
"If you are forgetful or make mistakes when in a hurry, a new study from Michigan State University—the largest of its kind to-date—found that meditation could help you to become less error prone. The research tested how open monitoring meditation—or, meditation that focuses awareness on feelings, thoughts or sensations as they unfold in one’s mind and body—altered brain activity in a way that suggests increased error recognition. “People’s interest in meditation and mindfulness is outpacing what science can prove in terms of effects and benefits,” said Jeff Lin, MSU psychology doctoral candidate and study co-author. “But it’s amazing to me that we were able to see how one session of a guided meditation can produce changes to brain activity in non-meditators.” The findings suggest that different forms of meditation can have different neurocognitive effects and Lin explained that there is little research about how open monitoring meditation impacts error recognition. “Some forms of meditation have you focus on a single object, commonly your breath, but open monitoring meditation is a bit different,” Lin said. “It has you tune inward and pay attention to everything going on in your mind and body. The goal is to sit quietly and pay close attention to where the mind travels without getting too caught up in the scenery.” Lin and his MSU co-authors—William Eckerle, Ling Peng and Jason Moser—recruited more than 200 participants to test how open monitoring meditation affected how people detect and respond to errors. The participants, who had never meditated before, were taken through a 20-minute open monitoring meditation exercise while the researchers measured brain activity through electroencephalography, or EEG. Then, they completed a computerized distraction test. “The EEG can measure brain activity at the millisecond level, so we got precise measures of neural activity right after mistakes compared to correct responses,” Lin said. “A certain neural signal occurs about half a second after an error called the error positivity, which is linked to conscious error recognition. We found that the strength of this signal is increased in the meditators relative to controls.” While the meditators didn’t have immediate improvements to actual task performance, the researchers’ findings offer a promising window into the potential of sustained meditation. “These findings are a strong demonstration of what just 20 minutes of meditation can do to enhance the brain’s ability to detect and pay attention to mistakes,” Moser said. “It makes us feel more confident in what mindfulness meditation might really be capable of for performance and daily functioning right there in the moment.” While meditation and mindfulness have gained mainstream interest in recent years, Lin is among a relatively small group of researchers that take a neuroscientific approach to assessing their psychological and performance effects. Looking ahead, Lin said that the next phase of research—which has been published in —will be to include a broader group of participants, test different forms of meditation and determine whether changes in brain activity can translate to behavioral changes with more long-term practice. “It’s great to see the public’s enthusiasm for mindfulness, but there’s still plenty of work from a scientific perspective to be done to understand the benefits it can have, and equally importantly, how it actually works,” Lin said. “It’s time we start looking at it through a more rigorous lens.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/how-meditation-can-help-you-make-fewer-mistakes-2/
"Reaching the age of 100 in good health and good spirits is an accomplishment in its own right, but training to take home your next weightlifting trophy truly takes the (birthday) cake. At the age of 98 years and 94 days, great-great-grandmother Edith Murway-Traina already had a Guinness World Record (GWR) as the “oldest female competitive powerlifter” under her belt—and she successfully deadlifted 150 pounds to do it. Traina’s storied win will be featured in the . As a former dance instructor and performer, physical fitness was always a way of life for the Bronx-born Florida transplant, but considering she took up weightlifting a scant nine years ago, the progress Traina’s made is truly impressive—especially since discovering her newfound avocation was pretty much a happy accident. Traina was tagging along with pal Carmen Gutworth who’d cajoled her into accompanying her to the gym to try out some new exercises. “She didn’t want to go by herself,” Murway-Traina told the . “She dragged me kicking and screaming all the way, so that’s more or less how I got there. “I saw all these other ladies lifting weights, and it looked interesting. I picked up a couple of weights and had to prove to myself that I could accomplish this.” While Gutworth disputes her friend’s version of the events: “You can’t drag Edith anywhere,” she jokingly told . “Edith kept going because she always keeps going. She will not quit, and anything that’s hard… that makes her more determined. If it’s easy, she might get bored, but if it’s hard, she’s going to do it. Nobody’s going to tell her, ‘Oh, that’s too hard for me.’” Once she got started, Traina turned out to be a natural. Soon enough, she was on the team, competing in senior events, and bringing home accolades and awards. “When you pull a bar up and you lift it, there’s a certain power that you experience that is only yours. It belongs to you,” she told the Post. Traina admits that harking back to her days as an entertainer, a great deal of her motivation has to do with how much she enjoys being in the limelight and the positive feedback she’s received. She says that every time she’d compete, she’d get applause, and every time she’d get applause, she’d get a little bit happier. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Traina’s doctors sent her to the sidelines but she returned to the gym as soon as she got the green light. She’s now back in training with coach Bill Beekley, working hard to make up for lost time and get back in shape for an upcoming November competition at which she hopes to bring home yet another winner’s cup to add to her collection. Traina also appreciates that her current notoriety largely has to do with her advanced age, but as long as she can be a positive role model who blows the “sweet little old lady stereotype” out of the water, she’s good with that. “I think in my nineties, I became more aware of the need for people to be recognized for who they are, or what they are, or how they are and it’s the most beautiful thing in the world,” she told . “I think I survive on that, mostly, myself.” That, some well-deserved applause, and her next trophy, of course.

"Most tours across America tend to involve a long series of flights, or a road trip of 16-hour driving days plotting a course between as many national parks as possible in a camper van. The Great Loop, traversed by only 200 Americans per year, however, is another excellent way to see the country. A 6,000-mile journey circumnavigating the entire eastern United States and Canada, the journey ditches the car or the plane for the boat! It turns out that in 1898, three 18 year olds discovered that it was possible to, without ever going out to sea, travel from the Great Lakes region, out to the Thousand Islands past Montreal, before snaking down a myriad of canals, sounds, and waterways across the Mid-Atlantic, using Florida as a gateway to the Gulf of Mexico, where turning north, one can pass up the rivers of Central North America to return again to the starting line. It was in the time of the Founding Fathers that the Great Loop was envisioned. George Washington had an eye on connecting territories more easily across the vast and newly minted country. Many of the surveys he commissioned of canals and artificial waterways that make the Loop possible. However it wasn’t until Ken Ransom, a sailor who grew up faring the waves in Lake Michigan, that America’s great nautical maze was mapped. Departing in a sailboat built by himself and his two friends, he went the whole way, Like Ransom, sailors on the Great Loop today will tell you the challenges are part of the fun. Whereas most long nautical pleasure journeys typically take place in the ocean, the myriad of habitats one must navigate to finish the Great Loop make it a lot more special, and safer, while also presenting different challenges. Beautiful landscapes roll past you on the shores either side of your journey, such as the old city of Montreal, the Great Dismal Swamp, the Florida Keys, Virginia’s Ablemarle Sound, or the mountain-studded shores of Lake Champlain.

"A series of smuggled paleontological finds recovered in a 2013 police raid in Santos Harbor, Brazil, contain the most complete crested pterosaur skeleton ever found. Seized along with 3,000 other fossils destined for the illegal fossil trade, the skeleton opens a new world of understanding about these incredibly charismatic flying animals. Belonging to the species the animal had an enormous head crest that would put a cassowary to shame, and was preserved in limestone from the Early Cretaceous period, around 140 to 100 million years ago. Having to make it easier to hide, the limestone block containing the skeleton needed to be carefully reassembled, but eight years after being found, Victor Beccari and his colleagues at the University of São Paolo a full description of the dinosaur which may actually have been more like a peacock than an eagle. The head crest was extraordinary, and was preserved along with the skull and the soft hollow bones that normally make pterosaurs a poor candidate for fossilization.

. In a similar way to when the theory irritated an awful lot of schoolchildren in the late ’90s, the scientist from Brazil has a new theory on how the mighty pterosaur spent its days. “Pterosaurs were already mind-blowing before, but this new specimen, with its huge, awkward crest and long neck, is mind-boggling because—sort of like [flashy] peacock tails—they would have made him an attractive mate, but an easy target for predators and a poor flyer,” Beccari told . “Like the peacock, it probably spent its time eating fruit off the ground or using its long neck to grab food from higher bushes.” Scans of the nasal cavity the animal had adaptations for powered flight, suggesting the animal would only have used its wings in certain circumstances—to escape predators for instance. It seems appropriate, however, to compare the pterosaur to a peacock because after all, dinosaurs evolved into birds.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/a-brazil-police-raid-resulted-in-recovering-the-most-complete-pterosaur-skeleton-ever/
"Years of cognitive development research have uncovered a wealth of knowledge about what children need to grow, thrive, and learn—but it’s also important to translate those insights into real-world applications. A new paper led by Penn State graduate Brenna Hassinger-Das, now an assistant professor of psychology at Pace University-NYC, and Jennifer Zosh, professor of human development and family studies at Penn State Brandywine, explores the science-backed core pillars of learning and examples of play spaces that incorporate them. “We know kids in Western countries spend only 20% of their time at school, so where are they for the other 80%?” Hassinger-Das said. “They’re at home, or in the grocery store, or the park. How can we transform those everyday spaces to encourage playful learning and promote conversations between caregivers and children? We wanted to maximize these spaces and turn them into places that are fun but also support the kind of learning you do in school.” According to the researchers, previous studies have found six core characteristics or “pillars” of learning that can maximize any experience a child has, whether it’s playing in the park, going to the grocery store, or using a smartphone app. These pillars suggest that experiences should be active rather than passive, engaging, meaningful, socially interactive, iterative rather than repetitive, and joyful. “We wanted to leverage insights from research to help support children, families and communities,” Zosh said. “For this specific initiative, we wanted to see how we could take those pillars and apply them to communities in playful ways that support children’s learning.” The paper looked at several examples of spaces that incorporated the pillars into their designs. One example was Urban Thinkscape, an installation that turned a bus stop into a playful learning space that fosters play and conversations. One of the features incorporated was an element called Stories, which includes several icons placed on the ground with different pictures that can be used to tell stories. According to the researchers, as children go from icon to icon and create a story, they build narrative skills, which are a key part of literacy. Even though the paper—recently published in the journal focused on public spaces that incorporated these elements, the researchers said anyone can use the pillars to enhance children’s play spaces and experiences, including parents at home. Stay “active” as you play and interact with your child, for example, by incorporating literary and STEM elements into your speech and interactions. Zosh said this could mean counting the apples out loud as you put them in your basket at the grocery store or asking your child what letter each block starts with as you build a tower. She also said asking lots of questions — such as “What would happen if we mixed these blue and yellow paints together?” or “What might happen if we stack the red square block on top of the yellow triangle block?” — can be helpful, as well. “Try to limit distractions as much as possible, including background television and your own smartphone use,” Hassinger-Das said. “These types of distractions are sometimes unavoidable, but they do have the potential to take away from these high-quality times with your child. Focusing and staying engaged during play can help you make the most of these interactions.” Try building on topics the child is already interested in during play. If they like dinosaurs, you could suggest a make-believe scenario where you dig for dinosaur fossils at the playground. Or, you can integrate information about dinosaurs like counting how many bones they have and what they ate. “If you are reading a book set in a different state, get out a globe or a map app and explore where the state is and how the weather there is different from where you live,” Zosh said. “Helping children build connections helps them weave together a rich world of understanding.” The researchers advised letting your child lead in play time while you offer support along the way. For example, let your child decide what to build with blocks while asking questions like, “What would happen if you placed that block in a different direction?” or “How many more blocks do you think it would take to build a tower as tall as you?” Children are naturally scientific thinkers — they like to experiment, see what happens, and try again and again until something works. The researchers advised giving your children opportunities to guess what will happen, conduct “experiments,” make up new words to favorite songs, and make mistakes. Every mistake leads to learning. Finally, making playtime joyful can be done in many ways, including incorporating elements of surprise. “Playing with shadows and asking which one is bigger or how you can make your shadow grow or shrink is one way to foster surprise and joy,” Hassinger-Das said. “Similarly, think about what helps your child connect with whatever brings them joy, from construction with a cardboard box to playing vet with their stuffed animals.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/science-backed-tips-play-time-with-kids/
"“To invent,” Thomas Edison said, “you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.” Colrerd Nkosi had all the junk he needed—and the will to bring electricity to his small village in Malawi—and he not only accomplished his goal, but won an award from the Queen of England. Using a repurposed corn-shelling machine motor and a fast-moving river, Nkosi created an electric turbine that’s now lighting up homes for him and his neighbors for free in the town of Mzimba. Just like Edison, he did a lot of experimenting. In the beginning, he put a bicycle in the river and brainstormed about how the current moved the pedals, and how it might be turned into power. Then, he used an old refrigerator compressor that converted power for 6 homes. His neighbors were clamoring, so he continued to upgrade. According to the self-taught inventor, his latest turbine has the potential to produce enough power to provide electricity to 1,000 homes and says another turbine can be installed downstream to expand the grid. ( ) The hydro power has the added benefit of lessening deforestation by negating the necessity for locals to cut down trees in order to obtain charcoal. In a country where only 11% of the population has access to electricity, having a reliable and renewable source of energy has been a game-changer—especially in the schools. “In the past, we had to study by candlelight and whenever there was no money to buy candles, we could not study,” student Gift Mfune . “Now that we have access to electricity, many more of us will pass our exams.” The driving force behind Nkosi’s DIY power initiative (known as the Kasangazi Hydro-Electrical Power Plant) is not profit. Indeed, the only charge for his service is a €1 per month maintenance fee. Over 2,000 people have benefitted from his sustainable and locally generated electricity, and in 2018, Mr. Nkosi won a Point Of Light Award from Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II for his dedication to innovation. In addition to bringing light to his neighbors literally, Nkosi’s dream is to bring enlightenment to them as well—through education. Nkosi already gives hands-on lessons in the basics of carpentry and engineering to village children, and fervently hopes to expand his own skillset with more advanced studies. “I wish I could find a sponsor to help me fulfill my plan of going back to school to further my knowledge and pass on what I’ve learned to others,” he said during his .

"A rewilding revolution which took root 30 years ago in the English Midlands has branched out over 200 square miles, becoming one of the most successful efforts in Europe. The National Forest now consists of nine million trees spread across three counties, and links the ancient woodlands of Needwood, and Charnwood. Reforestation has exploded across Europe, the continent that’s lost more of its forests over the last 200 years than any other. Between 1990 and 2010, by 11 million hectares, or around 27 million acres, and just since 2015, €8.2 billion has been earmarked by governments for reforestation efforts. The significance of the National Forest comes partly from where it’s taken shape. The English Midlands is one of the West’s famous mining regions, like the Ruhr Valley or the Appalachians. The history of the towns in the counties of Derbyshire (D-Arbee-sher), Leicestershire (Less-ter-sher), and Staffordshire are entwined with an industry that gradually died off, leaving behind disused mining pits and quarries as stains on the landscape. Now such blemishes have been turned into green parks and nature reserves, and have been combined with the surrounding countryside, farmland, and existing woods to give England a wilder heart. It’s also opened the Midlands up to many new forms of income for locals in historic towns like Burton-upon-Trent and “Coalville.” Every year the National Forest hosts the , a three-day celebration of nature, wilderness, and quiet reflection. Many of the villages are connected by the a three-day walking tour that traverses the forest and its mosaic of landscapes from east to west.

On Friday August 6 you can enjoy just that—as between 2-8 p.m participating A&W restaurants across the U.S. will give away free, small floats and collect donations for Disabled American Veterans. A&W’s partners with Disabled American Veterans, and since 2013 the franchise has raised more than $800,000 for veterans groups during these float days. “A&W has a long history of supporting veterans,” said A&W CEO Kevin Bazner —and on Friday, they hope to raise $200,000 for the organization serving more than one million veterans annually. America’s first and oldest restaurant chain, A&W still makes Root Beer fresh in each restaurant from real cane sugar, water, and a proprietary blend of herbs, bark, spices, and berries that are served in a frosty mug alongside burgers, fries, chicken tenders, and other favorites.

"When doing astronomy, you can’t blink, because the difference between a never-before-seen phenomenon, and just a regular day at the telescope can be as small as seeing faint X-rays turn into fainter X-rays for a short moment. That’s what happened when astrophysicist Dan Wilkins noticed, upon fixing his telescopes on the supermassive blackhole at the center of the galaxy I Zwicky, that following a normal series of powerful X-rays being flung out from the center, came unexpected additional flashes of X-rays that were smaller, later, and of different “colors.” What he was observing meant astronomers got to say something they love to say: The fainter, different colored lights came from behind the black hole when the powerful burst of X-rays reflected off gasses orbiting it, and which are drawn around by the magnetic and gravitational forces that blend space and time, allowing us to see them faintly. “Any light that goes into that black hole doesn’t come out, so we shouldn’t be able to see anything that’s behind the black hole,” said Wilkins, a research scientist at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford, . “The reason we can see that is because that black hole is warping space, bending light, and twisting magnetic fields around itself.” The discovery was made by the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton and NASA’s NuSTAR space telescopes, which captured the phenomenon in stages displayed for easy comprehension on the ESA website. At 10 million times the mass of our sun, the supermassive black hole at the center of I Zwicky, 1,800 light-years from our solar system, is surrounded by a swirling cloud of gas and dust that is continuously being pulled into the black hole, like water going down a drain, called a corona. The corona becomes heated to millions of degrees Kelvin as it spins around, creating disjointed magnetic fields that become “twisted into knots,” which eventually snap, This snapping creates a massive explosion of heat and energy, which generates bursts of X-rays called “flares” which can last for two and a half hours sometimes. During this particular discharge of X-rays, Wilkins observed the light reflecting off the gas on the opposite side of the black hole from where the telescopes were viewing it, which due to the bending of space and time around it, changed the properties and colors of the X-rays. The revelation that we can see light in different colors from the opposite ends of the black hole led Wilkins and his team to believe they could use them to create a color-coded 3D map of a black hole and its surroundings. reminds us that Einstein predicted black holes’ ability to bend light back in 1916, which along with the , the , and the discovery that new-born black holes “ring,” means that Einstein, more than 50 years after his death, is still making correct predictions at a faster rate than most living astrophysicists.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/astronomers-see-the-light-from-behind-a-black-hole/
"A mental health care company in Canada has been given federal approval to conduct a safety and “We are thrilled that Health Canada has issued its No Objection Letter allowing this important study to proceed and, in doing so, potentially advance Canada toward a legal, regulated system for MDMA-assisted therapy,” said Payton Nyquvest, CEO of Numinus. “We are gratified that our study will provide safety and outcome data to regulators to support integration of this treatment into mainstream mental health care.” This study has advanced through the pre-implementation stage at ‘ Vancouver clinic and has now received the required federal regulatory approval. Study preparations are now transitioning into the final stages of training staff, importing medication, and obtaining ethical approval to allow the recruitment of participants according to COVID-19 public health protocols. During the study, research, medical, and therapist staff at Numinus will collect data on the safety and effectiveness of MDMA-assisted therapy to inform Health Canada and support making MDMA-assisted therapy available to individuals living with PTSD in Canada. Through the collaboration and study activities, Numinus seeks to create access for patients with no other treatment options and establish the physical, human resource and other infrastructure required to scale up access to MDMA-assisted therapy if federal approvals are ultimately in place. Dr. Devon Christie, Numinus Medical and Therapeutic Services Director, will serve as the study’s Qualified Investigator and as a study therapist. Dr. Christie is a family physician with a focus in multidisciplinary pain management and a certified Relational Somatic Therapist. “Health Canada should be recognized for its ongoing leadership through its support of this study,” said Dr. Christie . “At our Vancouver clinic, we have spent months establishing the physical, technical, clinical, and human resource infrastructure needed to move the study forward and ultimately foster greater access to MDMA-assisted therapy.” In May 2021, MAPS announced results from its Phase 3 randomized clinical trial that confirmed the substantial efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD under the protocol. The trial demonstrated that 88% of participants who received three controlled and supervised MDMA-assisted therapy sessions experienced a clinically significant reduction in symptoms, with 67% no longer qualifying for PTSD diagnosis in comparison to 32% of participants randomized to placebo.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/numinus-health-canada-approval-mdma-ptsd-therapy-research/
"Creativity is hard to define, and even more difficult to measure, but a new four-minute test is creating an easy and elegant way to at least measure one of the most common characteristics of this very human trait. The test is simple, and consists of one question with ten answers: Can you think of two words that have nothing in common? What about five, what about ten? By measuring the semantic difference between the ten submitted words, a deep learning algorithm can “score” one of the most detectable aspects of creativity—the ability to mentally bridge the conceptual gap between things, called “Divergent Thinking.” Called the Divergent Association Task (DAT), it was formulated by a research team from McGill, Harvard, and the University of Melbourne. Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard came up with the idea from a childhood game. In a study of 9,000 people, Olson showed that his childhood game was wise beyond its years, as the scores followed similar patterns observed in two other common creativity tests. The first was the Alternative Uses Task, which asks participants to think of novel uses of an object and judges the distance between the established use and the answers given. The second was the Bridge-the-Associative Gap Test, which provides testers with two words, for example ‘book’ and ‘wood’, and asks them to provide a third which links the two—for example ‘bookshelf’. From people aged 7-70, in 98 countries, it was found in the study, published in that demographics mattered very little, with a slight statistical advantage given to younger people and women, but overall the results suggested that anyone can be creative. T he algorithm meant that since no humans were judging the scores, the ultimate example of bias—creative preference, could be surpassed. “Creativity is fundamental to human life,” Olson told his “The more we understand its complexity, the better we can foster creativity in all its forms.” Most of us would think of creativity as the end products we all enjoy, such as a painting, a symphony, or a poem, but far below and often months before a composer gets to direct the orchestra, it often starts with bending the rules. Music fans will know that the sound of Mississippi Delta Blues in America came about when guitar players started using the diminished fifth note when playing minor scales or minor chords, which was a sound considered for over a century to be so unpleasant it became taboo. It took their minor scales and chords from sounding sad the way a Disney movie sounds sad, to something totally different, but it started with disassociating correlated patterns of thought and behavior. Another easy example for those more fond of the canvas involves Van Gogh, whose act of painting ordinary things in colors that they don’t exist in changed the art scene he was popularized. Again it started with a person who was simply able to disassociate the things his mind had stuck together. “Our task measures only a sliver of one type of creativity,” says Olson. “But these findings enable creativity assessments across larger and more diverse samples with less bias, which will ultimately help us better understand this fundamental human ability.” Curious to see how creative you are?

"There are several “great walls” in the world, but in this very moment, none are greater than the “Great Wall of Louisiana,” the rebuilt-levees which just passed their first test as Hurricane Ida hit Eastern U.S. and parts of the Gulf Coast. The 1.8 mile-long, $1.3 billion storm surge barrier along Lake Borgne is the largest civil-works construction project in the history of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, built eight years after Katrina. Storms and two hurricanes have pressed the levees and other defense systems, but Ida is the first one to rival Katrina in fury. As one of the most powerful storms to hit the state since the 1850s, according to National Geographic, it was the moment that hundreds of contingency planners, and millions of residents were waiting for. Would the levees hold? “There is no catastrophic flooding in New Orleans,” Rene Poche, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers. “The system performed the way it was supposed to. That’s a big deal.” Of course, saying “the levees” is to insinuate that defenses like the Great Wall are the only things that stand between Bourbon Street and obliteration, but the wall is only a glorious centerpiece in a network of systems designed to dampen storm surges and funnel rainwater out of the area. For example, of the several that were build in the interlude between Katrina and Ida, the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway West Closure Complex is the . Built of 1,071 pilings measuring 225 feet-long and 26 feet-high, it would be capable of filling an Olympic swimming pool in an astonishing four seconds. Together, the wall and the pump are the first line of defense for preventing Lake Borgne, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway from inundating New Orleans, New Orleans East, the Ninth Ward, Gentilly, and St. Bernard Parish with flood waters. An additional 192 miles of levees and floodwalls, 3,530 acres of levee turf, and 244 land-based floodgates have been constructed with $14.5 billion of government money that has poured into Louisiana since Katrina. Several other very impressive structures, like the Seabrook Floodgate Complex, featuring two 220-ton gates and a 600 foot-long wall, fortify the areas further afield from New Orleans, but the systems are now being supported by greener defenses. The Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a man-made channel which exposed the freshwater marshlands in the delta there to toxic levels of salinity, has been closed, bringing historical salinity levels back to over a million acres of coastal habitat. “This means that the basin will be able to support a variety of species, ranging from cypress trees to oysters, while work is done to restore the vital storm surge buffer that forested wetlands and marshes provide nearby communities, including the Lower 9th Ward and St. Bernard Parish,” writes the non-profit America doesn’t always have the best track record of learning from the mistakes of the past, but at least in Louisiana the lessons of Katrina were well-taken, and hopefully we’ll see many storms like Ida succeed only in the huffing and puffing stages, without ever blowing the levees down.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-new-orleans-levees-held-for-the-first-katrina-level-storm-since-being-rebuilt/
"On Sept. 11, 2001, 66 men and women who worked for the investment banking firm Sandler O’Neill & Partners on the 104th floor in the World Trade Center lost their lives. In the harrowing days following the terrorist attacks, the company made the decision to set up a foundation to pay college tuition for all the 76 children of their fallen colleagues. I called the Sandler O’Neill Foundation the other day to talk about those children, and learned that 54 young men and women have had their college tuition paid so far, with 22 young men and women still eligible. The 54 who are now attending or have attended college have gone to every sort of school imaginable — from Stanford to Notre Dame to community colleges and technical institutes. Four students have attended Boston College, the alma mater of Welles Crowther, the 24-year-old Sandler O’Neill employee who saved as many as 12 people in the south tower before running back upstairs to save more people and never being seen again. The youngest child eligible was born six weeks after September 11. When that child graduates from college, the Sandler O’Neill Foundation will cease to exist, except in memory; but what a resounding memory it will be. Andy Armstrong was one of the founders of the foundation. Though he did not work for Sandler O’Neill, he was a friend of Sandler’s surviving partner, Jimmy Dunne. He and others of Dunne’s friends and colleagues – as well as banking competitors – helped set up and endow the foundation. “We were up and running by the end of the first week,” Armstrong says. “We wanted the families of the lost to know that we would always remember, that the passing years would never sweep this under the rug. People donated many millions of dollars to set up the foundation. We have no salaries and no expenses except fees to stay extant.” “I know most of the children who went to college. You wouldn’t believe some of the letters they have written in appreciation. I think they particularly appreciate that we remember their mom or dad this way. Many of them hardly knew their moms and dads.” I called Jimmy Dunne at Sandler O’Neill to ask him why he instantly did so very much the right thing, the extraordinary thing, when it would have been so easy and normal and understandable to just do enough. “Because there was a moment in time to stand up,” Dunne says, bluntly. “Because we believed that what we did would echo for a hundred years in the families of our people, their kids and their grandkids. Because how we conducted ourselves in those first few hours and days would define who we really were and what we were about.” “Because I knew that if we were not honorable, then we stood for nothing. I concluding immediately that we would not be intimidated, we would not go out of business, we will come back stronger than ever, and be an example of people who worked and lived with honor. And that meant taking care of our people and their children with respect and reverence. So we did that.” “We figured what we did and how we did it was our way of fighting idiots like bin Laden. You want us to fall apart? Then we will survive and flourish. You want to destroy us? Then we will insist even more on acting with honor. That’s what the foundation was for, is for. We want our defiance and reverence to echo for a century, so that the grandchildren of our people will know we stood for something, and acted honorably when it really counted.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bank-that-lost-66-workers-on-911-has-paid-for-kids-college/

"Renovating an old home will always produce surprises—but sometimes the discovery is a treasure that could fund the entire project. Three stonemasons working on a centuries-old estate purchased by a couple in 2012 in Plozevet, Brittany, found a hidden metal box embedded in a wall. They were shocked to find it stuffed with rare gold coins, minted during the reigns of French Kings Louis XIII and Louis XIV. 63-year-old François Mion, who owns the 13th century mansion with his wife, decided to turn the barn into a living space. When he got the call from his foreman, he “thought it was a joke.” Then, a few days later, above a beam, they discovered a bag containing another stash—which added to the grand total of 239 gold coins. The cache is being put up for auction on September 29, says , which estimates them to be worth well over a quarter million euros, or $300,000. : The couple submitted the trove to the Regional Preventive Archeology Service for authenticating and analyzing. They determined that the last known inhabitants of the mansion dates back to the mid-18th century, owned probably by wealthy land owners, possibly traders involved in the transport of Bordeaux wines to England. : French law states that the haul will be shared 50-50 between the owners of the property and those who discovered the coins—so the trio of stonemasons are likely lifting a glass to toast their luck. a French television report below…",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/3-stonemasons-find-stash-of-rare-gold-coins/
"The “world’s largest” factory built solely for the purpose of drawing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it, has just come online in Iceland. Built in the geothermal park in Hellisheidi, the company hopes this is merely a stepping stone necessary to scale up the model by a factor of 80, and thereby remove millions of tons of CO2 by the end of the decade. As direct a climate solution as there could be, the , just one of a number of climate change solutions offered by the Icelandic firm Carbfix, takes CO2 from the air before separating the carbon from the oxygen, mixing it with water and sending it deep underground into basalt rock formations where it mineralizes. With 16 locations recycling CO2, Climeworks, the Swiss company which provided Orca with the CO2 intake fans, are extremely excited to have participated in a project that will permanently remove carbon, rather than just recycling it. the green technology can be reproduced easily, and to scale, anywhere there is renewable energy and storage available. Orca was built adjacent to a local geothermal power plant, so it runs fully on renewable energy. : The company says it can pull 4,000 tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere every year, the equivalent of taking 870 cars off the road. On its own, it’s a small impact for the $10-15 million it takes to build, but as companies are increasingly pressured to provide carbon offsets for their operations, the technology offers a huge appeal if costs come down and production is boosted. For example, offsetting emissions by planting trees is great, but it takes 50 years for a tree to gather enough CO2 to actually sequester it. If the tree dies before that period, it’s as if the company did nothing. : A Canadian company, , which has received $25 million in funding from the government, is building a technology that directly captures CO2 from the air and stores it as compressed gas, or creates a near-carbon-neutral fuel. They are currently building what they call the world’s largest direct air capture plant in the southwestern US that, when operational, will remove more than 1 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year, about the same as 40 million mature trees. But for Carbfix, knowing the carbon is stored deep underground where it won’t emerge for hundreds of millions of years is the most verifiable way of demonstrating their commitment to addressing the climate crisis. :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/iceland-builds-a-factory-to-bury-co2-in-rock/
"Our partner Rob Brezsny provides his weekly wisdom to enlighten our thinking and motivate our mood. Rob’s , is a syndicated weekly column appearing in over a hundred publications. He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Between 37 and 41 BCE, Virgo-born served as third Emperor of Rome. To do so, he had to disprove the prophecy of a renowned astrologer, Thrasyllus of Mendes. Years earlier, Thrasyllus had predicted that Caligula, despite being well-connected, “had no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Bay of Baiae”—a distance of two miles. Once in power, Caligula arranged to have a series of pontoon boats arrayed across the bay, enabling him to ride his favorite horse Incitatus from one shore to the other across the Bay of Baiae. I foresee the possibility of a comparable turn of events for you, Virgo. Is there a curse you want to undo? A false prophecy you’d like to cancel? Someone’s low expectation you would love to debunk? The coming weeks will be a favorable time. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): College student Amelia Hamrick studied the right panel of Hieronymus Bosch’s 15th-century painting . It depicts a hellish scene. Cities are on fire. Weird beasts devour sinful humans. There are demons and torture chambers. Hamrick did what no one in the history of art had ever done: She transcribed the musical score that the artist had written on a man’s naked hindquarters. Her work inspired a composer to create a recording entitled “500-Year-Old Butt Song from Hell.” In the coming weeks, I invite you to perform feats comparable to Hamrick: 1. Explore the past for useful, overlooked clues. 2. Find or create redemptive transformations out of stressful situations. 3. Have fun telling stories about your past misadventures. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Born on one of the Galapagos Islands, Diego is a giant tortoise who has lived for over 100 years. He’s a member of a species that had dwindled to a population of 15 by 1977. That’s when he and his tortoise colleague, whose name is E5, became part of a breeding program with 12 female tortoises. E5 was reserved in his behavior, but Diego was a showboat who vocalized loudly as he enjoyed public mating rituals. Together —producing over 2,000 offspring in subsequent years. According to my astrological analysis, you could be as metaphorically fertile as Diego and E5 in the coming months—even if you prefer to adopt an approach more akin to E5’s. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): “The meaning of my existence is that life has addressed a question to me,” wrote psychologist . “Or, conversely, I myself am a question that is addressed to the world, and I must communicate my answer, for otherwise, I am dependent upon the world’s answer.” These are superb meditations for you Sagittarians during the coming weeks. Between now and October 1, I invite you to keep a journal where you write about two subjects: 1. What is the main question that life asks you? 2. What is the main question that your life asks the world? CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): North Korea’s Capricorn leader Kim Jong-un has an amazing résumé, if you believe the official state media that boasts he learned to drive at age three, was an accomplished sailor at nine, and became a skilled musician, artist, and scientist. Is it possible you have unexpressed powers like these, Capricorn? If so, the coming weeks will be a favorable time to identify them and start tapping into their potential. It’s time to develop your dormant talents. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Aquarian author testified, “I think of beauty as an absolute necessity. I don’t think it’s a privilege or an indulgence. It’s almost like knowledge, which is to say, it’s what we were born for.” I urge you to adopt her perspective during the next four weeks, Aquarius. In my astrological opinion, a devoted quest for beauty will heal exactly what most needs to be healed in you. It will teach you everything you most need to know. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Poet and translator Anne Carson periodically joins with her husband Robert Currie to teach a workshop called “EgoCircus.” It’s an ironic title, because the subject they teach is the art of collaboration. To develop skills as a collaborator, of course, people must lay aside at least some of their egos’ needs and demands. In accordance with current astrological potentials, I encourage you to stage your own version of EgoCircus in the coming weeks. The time is ripe for you to hone your creative togetherness and synergistic intimacy. ARIES (March 21-April 19): “We need to become more unreasonable but in an intelligent way,” says Aries politician Jerry Brown. Yes! I agree! And that’s especially true for you right now, Aries. To Brown’s advice, I will add this message from Aries fashion designer Vivienne Westwood: “Intelligence is composed mostly of imagination, insight—things that have nothing to do with reason.” Here’s one further suggestion to help you take maximum advantage of cosmic rhythms, courtesy of Aries historian : “The supreme accomplishment is to blur the line between work and play.” TAURUS (April 20-May 20): “I have become whole and complete, like a thundering cloudburst in summer,” wrote Taurus poet . I love that metaphor for fullness: not an immaculate icon of shiny, sterile perfection, but rather a primal, vigorous force of nature in all of its rumbling glory. I hope you like this symbol as much as I do, and I hope you use it to fuel your creative spirit in the coming weeks. PS: Keep in mind that many indigenous people welcome rainstorms as a source of fertility and growth. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): “Pandiculation” is a word that refers to when you stretch and yawn at the same time. According to my understanding of the astrological omens, you will benefit from doing a lot of pandiculations in the coming days. I also recommend gazing lazily out the window and looking at the sky a lot. Keep your shoes off as much as possible, get a massage or three, and let yourself sleep more than you customarily do. Did you know that sighing deeply is good for your lungs’ health? Here’s your homework: Dream up all the things you can do to relax and renew yourself. It’s prime time to indulge in generous acts of self-healing. CANCER (June 21-July 22): The ancient Roman author Pliny’s ten-volume , written in the first century, was a monumental encyclopedia of the natural world, unprecedented in its own time and for centuries afterward. It offered compilations of facts about astronomy, geography, zoology, botany, mineralogy, and many other subjects. There was one big problem with it, however. It contained a great deal of erroneous information. For example, Pliny described in detail many non-existent animals, including dragons, flying horses, and giant serpents that swallowed bulls and snatched birds out of the sky. My reason for telling you this is to inspire you to be extra discerning in the coming weeks. Be especially skeptical of authorities, experts, and other know-it-alls who are very confident despite being inaccurate or erroneous. It’s time for you to increase your trust in your own authority. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): “There are those fortunate hours when the world consents to be made into a poem,” writes Leo poet . That’s great for a poet. But what about for everyone else? My variation on Doty’s comment is this: There are fortunate hours when the world consents to be made into a holy revelation or a lyrical breakthrough or a marvelous feeling that changes our lives forever.

"I have often had a yearning spirit. I’m ambitious, I tell myself. But if I’m honest, my “ambition” is often a vicious sniper, promising happiness while spraying me with self-attack: you should be further along, weigh less, have more self-worth, started a movement, married money. This kind of “ambition”—a regret-fest or siren song of someday success—takes me down. Happiness comes from being in the moment, this moment. Every therapist or guru says the same thing. ‘You’re not doing it right, you have to learn how to go with the flow,’ squawks Zen Girl, my Self Improvement Alter Ego. And believe me, I want to tell her where she can go. I am in this secret race to be somewhere else. Better yet, to be someone else, someone better than me. I’ve called this ambition. But, really, it’s self-abandonment. My healing comes from loving myself where I am—and as I am. Everything else is a frenetic and impoverished way of being in my one and only sacred life. Peace is here, not over there in some fantasy I have. If there wasn’t something here for me, I wouldn’t be here. Magic is here. I may not see it yet, but I know I’ll never see it until I start looking for it where I am. My life reflects an intelligent design, and my True Self always has my highest interests encoded into the program. The media drums it into us: a better life is “over there” just around the corner or one purchase away. But, I am daring to welcome love into my life right now. I am calling my life holy, and arriving wholly in this moment, just as it is. It’s not always pretty—but it is always sacred. I’m not giving up on my dreams. I’m giving up on my criticism. I’m taking in what I already have. This is empowerment. This is where the journey begins: “I do not want to be anywhere else.” I wrote these words for myself, sort of as an incantation, a recipe for freedom. My ego, the part of me that hurtles to the finish line, even if it means missing or dismissing my entire life, recoils when I say these words. : These are words of luxury. These are words of mystery. These are words of quantum healing. I sit down on the silk blue pillow of my own true life. If even for just this moment, I stop searching, demanding, aching, and casting about. To a part of me this feels as awkward as running backward. But really all I am doing is not rejecting my own life. This is what it means to stop and receive. I am like a hungry bird—and the only source of nutrition is my present life. It’s not over there or under that. It doesn’t come later, and it doesn’t get better. I get better. I get better by discovering the uncanny instruction of my own life. I am letting go of fierce striving. It’s beautiful to reach for further expression out of joy or devotion. But I want to let go of any self-hatred that propels me forward. “The cracks are where the light gets in,” says word magician Leonard Cohen. I will behold the cracks in my life. They, too, are part of my treasure. They, too, have soul nutrition. That’s why they’re here. Everything has something to give me. When I see my life with loving eyes, I understand what is here. Everything has always awaited me like a white bowl of handpicked blueberries. Only I wanted to sit at someone else’s table. I wanted another fruit. I wanted another life. That desire cost me more than I know. I’m not going to pay that price anymore. I am going to seize the only existence I have. I am seizing my blueberries, my exhausting day or confusion, frustration, or elation. These are the words that came to me in my journal: This does not mean I won’t walk out of the rain into a dry place. It means I will not belittle the rain. I will not condemn the rain. I will move forward. I will go where I am called and where I belong. : Yes, I will certainly dream of what I wish my life to be, and I will invest in and create those dreams. I will rise. But not with irritation or deprivation in my heart. I don’t want to shun my own day, my own breath, my own efforts or even lack of efforts. As of this moment, I refuse to sully and bully my own existence in the name of “realizing my potential.” I do not want to be anywhere else. This is my mantra. This is my saber. This is my ticket. : For me, this is a practice, the practice of a lifetime. I am learning that acceptance is something I want and it’s not a form of resignation. Acceptance is fierce. When I truly accept myself where I am, it’s a rush of compassion and a jolt of awakening. Acceptance is the willingness to embrace your life, your one true, beautiful, challenging, disappointing, shocking, devastating and intriguing life. It’s the decision to stay present and not slip into the destructive undertow of resistance and rejection. Acceptance is a form of self-blessing, the secret catalyst that galvanizes the whole darn ride right now. , an honors graduate of Harvard Law School, left her law practice to write and help others create their most extraordinary lives.

"When armed conflict is a way of life, a lasting resolution may seem beyond reach. And yet, while small acts of personal courage may not ultimately shape the larger outcome, there are some people on both sides who continue reaching for peace nevertheless. Israeli kindergarten teacher and mother-of-three Idit Harel Segal wanted to do something meaningful for her 50th birthday. Rather than receiving a present, she chose to give one. In memory of her late grandfather, Segal decided to donate a kidney. The life-saving gift Segal offered not only aligns with her Jewish faith—but was her way of extending an olive branch as well, because the kidney recipient was a 3-year-old Palestinian boy from the Gaza Strip. Although there are strict restrictions in place limiting the number of entry permits, the Jerusalem-based, nongovernmental organization Matnat Chaim was able to arrange for the surgical procedure on humanitarian grounds. (To move the little boy to the head of the donor list in Gaza, his father also agreed to donate a kidney to an Israeli patient, a 25-year-old mother of two.) With all the pieces in place, the surgery was scheduled for June 16, 2021, but before it took place, Segal wanted to make sure the little boy would know just how much giving this particular gift meant to her when he grew older, so she sent him a letter. “You don’t know me… You don’t understand my language and I don’t understand yours, but soon we’ll be very close because my kidney will be in your body,” she wrote. “I hope with all my heart that this surgery will succeed and you will live a long and healthy and meaningful life.” In the hospital, Segal met with the little boy and his mother.* She sat next to them on his hospital bed, and as the mother comforted her son, Segal sang to him until he nodded off. “He fell asleep, then I left. I cried,” she recalled in an interview with the (AP). “It was really moving. Deep inside I knew I did something good.” Segal admits her course of action wasn’t received without conflict within her own family. Her husband, eldest son, and father initially opposed the plan. But Segal—considering the gesture as the way to best honor the values of the beloved grandfather she’d lost five years earlier—held firm to a decision she says came on the heels of an 11-day outbreak of renewed hostilities. “I threw away the anger and frustration and see only one thing. I see hope for peace and love,” she told AP. “And if there will be more like us, there won’t be anything to fight over.” Eventually, her family came to appreciate and embrace the choice she’d made. Segal believes that compared to the grander scheme of things, what she’s done is only “a small thing”—but even so, any step closer to peace taken in good faith is a step in the right direction.

"To help prevent sparking California wildfires, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has announced a major new initiative to bury 10,000 miles of power lines underground. In addition to significantly reducing wildfire risk, undergrounding also benefits customers by lessening the need for Public Safety Power Shutoffs—which are called as a last resort during dry, windy conditions to reduce the risk of vegetation contacting live power lines and setting off a wildfire. This effort will also help ease the need for vegetation management efforts, leaving more of California’s trees untouched. “We have taken a stand that catastrophic wildfires shall stop,” said CEO Patti Poppe in a . “We will gladly partner with policymakers and state and local leaders to map a path we can all believe in.” Pacific Gas and Electric Company is the nation’s largest natural gas and electric utility— serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California. In the past, undergrounding has been done on a select, case-by-case basis, and largely for reasons other than wildfire risk reduction. Following the devastating October 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp Fire, PG&E began to evaluate placing overhead power lines underground as a wildfire safety measure, and to better understand the construction and cost requirements associated with undergrounding for system hardening purposes. In 2019, PG&E announced it would rebuild all its power lines underground in the Town of Paradise as it helps the community recover from the Camp Fire. The company is also rebuilding power lines underground within the 2020 North Complex Fire footprint in Butte County. Through these and other demonstration projects and rebuild efforts, PG&E has been able to refine the construction and cost requirements associated with targeted undergrounding, enabling the acceleration and expansion of undergrounding projects. “Ten thousand miles of [buried] line is a trip halfway around the planet, 10,000 miles of line is a trip from Chico to L.A. 11 times and back,” Poppe said. “We will partner with the best and the brightest to find the best solutions to make this audacious goal come to life.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/pge-bury-10000-miles-power-lines-california-wildfire/
"A hotel in Iceland is calling all photographers for a three-week paid vacation to capture images of this year’s northern lights, as if such work needed a reward. Seeking a professional “Lights-catcher,” the luxurious Hotel Rangá is hosting open applications to any capable and established photographers to stay at their location on the south coast of Iceland, and at their sister hotel in the extremely remote central region for three weeks between late September early October. To apply, photographers (that at the time of writing still works and is receiving submissions). Applicants must describe social media and online presence, vaccination status, ability to travel, and other optional questions. “In exchange for providing content of the Northern Lights at the hotel, this seasonal employee will receive free room and board, along with access to the hotel’s stargazing observatory and hot tubs, not to mention the opportunity to explore the photogenic land of fire and ice on their days off,” the website writes. An established portfolio will do any perspective lights-catchers good, as in an email correspondence with the hotel revealed they had already received 2,000 applicants from 40 countries. But that’s no reason to despair, as they won’t be selecting the right candidate until the end of August. Hotel Rangá has retractable roofs, professional telescopes, high wind-proof walls for stargazers, and visiting astronomers to go over the star-facts and aurora with any guests.

"When you look at yourself in the bathroom mirror, do you focus in on your favorite feature and give yourself a compliment? Do you think about how grateful you are to be alive, and fortunate to have a bathroom with hot and cold running water? Or do you focus on something you wish were different, and hear a critical inner voice? If you tend to find fault and criticize yourself, know that you have plenty of company among your fellow humans. In fact, our tendency to focus attention on negative issues instead of positive ones is a shared characteristic we carry from our earliest evolutionary survival needs. This ‘negativity bias,’ as science has labeled it, is our typical default orientation. Moving toward a more loving, appreciative, and grateful way of being—both towards ourselves and towards others—is something we are all capable of doing. But it does require awareness and repetition. If we are ready to be kind to ourselves and willing to send that negative voice away on permanent vacation, how do we begin to build our capacity for self-compassion? Kristin Neff, PhD, the world’s , identifies three elements of self-compassion that offer a roadmap to strengthening our self-compassion skills. Let’s investigate the three elements—mindfulness, self-kindness, and recognition of our common humanity—to create a self-compassion toolkit. Circle back to the first mention of the bathroom mirror chat with yourself. We asked you to notice whether your positive or negative voice was more dominant. Noticing, paying attention, and being aware of how you are already treating yourself is really the first step. Mindfulness, which simply means paying attention to what is happening in the present moment, allows us to be aware of what our inner dialogue is doing. It’s most helpful to approach this awareness gently, and without judgment. In other words, if you want to be gentler to yourself, you can’t get angry with yourself for being angry with yourself. Begin by simply naming what you are feeling and what your inner voice is saying to you. Use your actual name as you describe what you are doing, seeing, and feeling, “Laura is really upset with herself for looking so tired and for the bags under her eyes since she went to bed super late the last few nights.” Then, instead of judging and blaming yourself, be curious about what you did and the motivation. Recognize that our actions generally arise from a place of wanting to feel safe and wanting to do the right thing. Name that positive motive, “I am upset with myself and the way I look because I want to get all my assignments complete on time.” Remind yourself that you are doing the best you can with what you’ve got. And keep your attention on the positive aspects of the situation. : For many people, once they tune in carefully to that inner voice, it can be jolting to notice how we regularly speak to ourselves. Recognizing that you speak to yourself in ways that you would never speak to a friend is the next step to deepening your self-compassion by ramping up our self-kindness. One of the challenges of self-compassion is that compassion itself is a relational skill, i.e,. it’s easier to offer compassion to someone else. It’s hard to acknowledge our primary relationship with ourselves, and to view it through the lens of a loving relationship. Know that we all are worthy of love, we are all enough. With a little practice, showing loving kindness to yourself might first seem awkward, but will begin to come more easily. Soon the positive feeling you receives from self-kindness will provide its own sense of wellbeing and become self-reinforcing. : At The Center for Compassionate Leadership, one of our favorite practices to strengthen your self-kindness is called “Note to a Dear Friend.” It’s a straightforward way to turn the kindness that you can naturally offer others toward yourself. When you are facing a challenge or hardship, write a note to a friend as if they were facing the same problem. Write down what is in your heart that you think would help comfort your friend. Then, take the note and replace your friend’s name in the salutation with your own. The on the Center’s website. A very natural response to our own suffering is to screen it off from friends and family so that they don’t see our troubles. We might feel ashamed, embarrassed, or just not perfect enough. We want others to see our wonderful, happy life. It is very important to remember that no one is immune – we all meet suffering at some point, and some of us unfortunately suffer more than others, Everyone faces challenges and makes mistakes. Not one of us leads a picture perfect life! In this age of social media it is particularly difficult to grasp that we all have troubles. The social feeds of other people are the “highlight reels” of their lives, and our daily life is going to be very challenged to compare to that “highlight reel.” When we recognize that suffering is a common human trait, a couple of valuable things happen. First, our suffering gets a little bit less lonely. I can acknowledge I am not the only person suffering, and that takes a weight off my shoulders, knowing I am not alone. Second, it becomes a little easier to open up to others, and say, “I’m hurting or I need help.” We don’t have to pretend that everything is great when it isn’t. It’s OK to take off the masks and let people know exactly how we are. In fact, being honest about our feelings is the best way to develop more closeness and intimacy, because we all understand these difficult moments happen! : Self-compassion is a skill that gets better and better the more you practice it. Like any new habit development, repetition is key for the brain to establish new neural connections. Like muscles in your physical body, training is important to strengthen and sharpen your skills.It also gets easier. So start with small steps, and keep on moving forward. Be patient and celebrate every success, large or small. Every time you recognize how you treat yourself makes the next recognition smoother and easier. Each word of self-kindness you offer yourself reinforces how valuable it is to do. And every time you see your own suffering in the context of the suffering of the world builds deeper connections to others, which make healing and wellbeing easier. Taking up an intentional practice of self-compassion becomes a fulfilling, self-reinforcing path towards greater wholeness and happiness. : Just imagine looking at yourself in that mirror and feeling the warmth of love toward yourself as you do for a partner, child, best friend, or pet. Try on some self-compassion skills, and see yourself in a whole new light.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/self-compassion-researcher-suggests-4-steps-to-overcome-negativity-bias/
"The Tokyo Summer Olympics is bringing out the best in all of us. We’ve been looking for inspiring stories and have found some great shows of humility, humanity, and smarts. Here’s a roundup of our favorite moments from the games, so far. When the schedule for a swimming relay race was radically altered, it left one American athlete sitting out of the qualifying heats to stay fresh for final. Then, in a display of sportsmanship after winning gold, Caeleb Dressel found his teammate in the stands and tossed him the medal. After the team’s first-place finish, as a show of thanks, Dressel located Brooks Curry in the stands and tossed him his gold medal, diverting the gaze of the world toward the man whose fast swimming got them to the finals. While Curry would later receive a medal of his own, only the finalists got to stand on the podium—and Dressel took the opportunity to show what teamwork is all about. Class. 🥇 Caeleb Dressel gave his gold medal to Brooks Curry, who swam for Dressel in the prelims. Dressel replaced Curry for the final. x Team USA’s Isaiah Jewett had a good shot at the men’s 800m, but a Botswana runner in front of him fell and they both crashed to the track in a tangle. However, the heartwarming scene that followed proved a real winner. Jewett could see that Nijel Amos was also devastated, so he offered his competitor a hand up, and the pair supported one another, determined to complete the race and cross the finish line together. “He apologized, and I was like, ‘Let’s just finish the race,’” he told the . After having their races cut short, Isaiah Jewett and Nijel Amos showed the ultimate sportsmanship. In a real nail-biter, two athletes in the men’s high jump had perfect scores—each had cleared jumps of 2.37 meters (7 feet, 9.25 inches). Gianmarco Tamberi from Italy and Mutaz Barshim from Qatar had similarly tied in 2010, and had formed a unique bond between champions—especially after each faced career-ending ankle injuries, but recovered. Tamberi was even on hand for Barshim’s 2018 wedding in Sweden. Normally, an Olympic winner would be determined by a jump-off, in case of a tie. But, Barshim spontaneously asked officials if the two men, who were now longtime friends, could share the gold—and they were given the green light. “I look at him, he looks at me, and we know it,” Barshim told the . “This is a dream come true. It is the true spirit, the sportsman spirit.” When Mutaz Essa Barshim and Gianmarco Tamberi finished the men's high jump competition tied, they could have gone to a jump-off to decide the winner. Instead, they decided to share the gold, and their reaction is what we love about sports. In a heartwarming moment for their family—and the host nation of Japan—a brother and sister, after a prolonged overtime battle, won gold on the same day. 21-yer-old Abe Uta took the top prize in the women’s judo finals and, hours later, her brother Hifumi threw down for top honors in the men’s division—making them the first brother and sister pair ever to win Olympic gold on the same day. “This was a dream for us,” Uta told , “It makes me believe dream comes true as long as I try to achieve it.” Her brother didn’t feel any pressure, rather: “It made me crave for it…  Today is the best day of my life.” Peak family goals! Japanese siblings, Hifumi Abe & Uta Abe, made history this past weekend after they both brought home the gold on the same day! 🇯🇵 Without a coach or any endorsement support, a 30-year-old with a Ph.D. in mathematics won the gold medal for Austria. After 91 miles of pedaling (147km), Anna Kiesenhofer crossed the finish line ahead of both the defending champion and the world titleholder, by solving the equation for training all on her own. Considered a novice in the sport, Kiesenhofer credits her gold-medal performance to the ‘beautiful mind’ she’s cultivated in her chosen field. “As a mathematician, you’re used to solving problems on your own, so that’s the way I approach cycling,” she told . “Many cyclists…have a trainer, they have a nutritionist, they have the guy that plans the race for them.

"One might think that since we can take detailed images of galaxies millions of light years away, there’s no way something as significant a moon could exist within our solar system without our knowledge, but not only are there moons we don’t know of yet, but they are being found by amateur astronomers. In the equivalent of putting the 80th star on a flag of Jupiter, hobbyist Kai Ly officially submitted evidence of an 80th moon of Jupiter, a hitherto unlocated heavenly body of red rock. Currently awaiting a common name, the moon is believed to be a piece of a very large comet absorbed by Jupiter’s gargantuan gravitational field, rather than a shard of the planet itself. This isn’t the only moon, believe it or not, which Ly has discovered. Indeed, using data from a detailed survey of the Jupiter space in 2003 from the Canada-France-Hawai’i Observatory, Ly and parsed the fifth from the same data as a “summer hobby before… school”. “I’m proud to say that this is the first planetary moon discovered by an amateur astronomer,” wrote Ly in a to the astronomy community. “Other than that, there really isn’t anything remarkable about this Jovian moon—it’s just a typical member of the retrograde Carme group.” Discovered in 1938, the is a group of “Jovian moons” (Moons of Jupiter) that all came from a single large comet or other kind of debris. The largest moon in the group, carrying 99% of its total mass, is named Carme, but is just 14 miles in diameter. The clip below demonstrates the “miniscularity” of the new moon. The Carme group is notable for its dramatic elliptical orbit, but also because they orbit in the opposite direction to the planet itself, known as a retrograde. While the recently-discovered “EJc0061 = S/2003 J 24,” is the last of the known Jovian moons to be found, there could be more, of yet undiscovered ones. The are fascinating objects, which include entities like Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, while Ganymede, the largest of the Jovian moons, is the only moon in our solar system with a magnetic field, which gives it an aurora by the way. The best periods for looking are when the Earth and Jupiter are skewered by the sun, allowing us to view it in full light.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/amateur-astronomer-discovers-the-80th-moon-of-jupiter/
"Oh, who lives in a pineapple under the sea… around the Retriever Seamount 200 miles off the New England coast in the Atlantic Ocean? Well according to one marine biologist, it’s SpongeBob SquarePants and his mate, Patrick Star. The yellow and pink duo from the iconic children’s cartoon were spotted next to each other by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) remote-controlled submersible launched from the Okeanos Explorer, just as they share the same block in their fictional home of Bikini Bottom. A starfish expert quickly saw the image taken by the submersible and shared it on Twitter, commenting on the striking resemblance the two lifeforms shared to their cartoon counterparts. *laugh* I normally avoid these refs..but WOW. REAL LIFE Sponge bob and Patrick! Retreiver seamount 1885 m “I thought it would be funny to make the comparison, which for once was actually kind of comparable to the iconic images/colors of the cartoon characters,” Mah told While discovering the actual location of SpongeBob’s home, the NOAA team were mapping the of the Mid-Atlantic, down to the lightless depths were such creatures prefer to live. About as square a sponge as anyone will ever see (the animals are normally round, oblong, or in no shape whatsoever), Mah identified the sponge as the genus which normally appears white or orange to camouflage with their environment. He also identified the starfish seen idly by his fictional neighbor as which are known to be pink, and which use suction cups on the underside of their limbs to scoot around the ocean floor. Those blessed with memories of the show will remember the few episodes that take place in “Rock Bottom,” a scary town filled with bottom-dwelling fish, representing the Benthic Zone. That’s more like it as far as real sponges and stars are concerned, and where the submersible was going when it spotted the real-life versions. Additionally, while Patrick and SpongeBob were inseparable companions in the show, the real relationship between these organisms is rather more like that of a lion and a wildebeest. Starfish are predators, and eat sponges if they can find them. Along with this delightful discovery, the Okeanos Explorer hopes to uncover many more secrets of the North Atlantic depths through the ASPIRE program of scientific pursuit and discovery.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/underwater-robot-finds-spongebob-and-patrick-in-north-atlantic/
"New research comparing the anatomy and behavior of dogs and wolves suggests dogs’ facial anatomy has changed over thousands of years specifically to allow them to better communicate with humans. In the first detailed analysis comparing the anatomy and behavior of dogs and wolves, researchers found that the facial musculature of both species was similar, except above the eyes. Dogs have a small muscle, which allows them to intensely raise their inner eyebrow, which wolves do not. The authors at University of Portsmouth suggest that the inner eyebrow raising movement triggers a nurturing response in humans because it makes the dogs’ eyes appear larger, more infant like, and also resembles a movement humans produce when they are sad. The research team, led by comparative psychologist Dr Juliane Kaminski at the University of Portsmouth, included a team of behavioural and anatomical experts in the UK and USA. Dr Kaminski said: “The evidence is compelling that dogs developed a muscle to raise the inner eyebrow after they were domesticated from wolves. “We also studied dogs’ and wolves’ behavior, and when exposed to a human for two minutes, dogs raised their inner eyebrows more and at higher intensities than wolves. “The findings suggest that expressive eyebrows in dogs may be a result of humans unconscious preferences that influenced selection during domestication. When dogs make the movement, it seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them. This would give dogs that move their eyebrows more a selection advantage over others and reinforce the ‘puppy dog eyes’ trait for future generations.” Dr Kaminski’s previous research showed dogs moved their eyebrows significantly more when humans were looking at them compared to when they were not looking at them. She said: “The AU101 movement is significant in the human-dog bond because it might elicit a caring response from humans but also might create the illusion of human-like communication.” Lead anatomist Professor Anne Burrows, at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, co-author of the paper, said: “To determine whether this eyebrow movement is a result of evolution, we compared the facial anatomy and behaviour of these two species and found the muscle that allows for the eyebrow raise in dogs was, in wolves, a scant, irregular cluster of fibers. “The raised inner eyebrow movement in dogs is driven by a muscle which doesn’t consistently exist in their closest living relative, the wolf. “This is a striking difference for species separated only 33,000 years ago and we think that the remarkably fast facial muscular changes can be directly linked to dogs’ enhanced social interaction with humans.” The findings show how important faces can be in capturing our attention, and how powerful facial expression can be in social interaction. Co-author and anatomist Adam Hartstone-Rose, at North Carolina State University, said: “These muscles are so thin that you can literally see through them—and yet the movement that they allow seems to have such a powerful effect that it appears to have been under substantial evolutionary pressure. “It is really remarkable that these simple differences in facial expression may have helped define the relationship between early dogs and humans.” The only dog species in the study—published in the journal (PNAS)—that did not have the muscle was the Siberian husky, which is among more ancient dog breeds. An alternative reason for the human-dog bond could be that humans have a preference for other individuals which have whites in the eye and that intense AU 101 movements exposes the white part of the dogs eyes. It is not known why or precisely when humans first brought wolves in from the cold and the evolution from wolf to dog began, but this research helps us understand some of the likely mechanisms underlying dog domestication.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-evolution-of-puppy-dog-eyes-portsmouth/
"Walmart will be investing nearly $1 billion over the next five years in career-driven training and development for its workers. The largest U.S. private employer, the company announced last week that it will pay 100% of college tuition and books for its associates through its Live Better U (LBU) education program. As of August 16, the $1 a day fee will be removed for associates—making all education programs paid for by Walmart. This means approximately 1.5 million part-time and full-time Walmart and Sam’s Club associates in the U.S. can earn college degrees or learn trade skills without the burden of education debt. “We are creating a path of opportunity for our associates to grow their careers at Walmart, so they can continue to build better lives for themselves and their families,” said Lorraine Stomski, senior vice president of learning and leadership at Walmart, . “This investment is another way we can support our associates to pursue their passion and purpose while removing the barriers that too often keep adult working learners from obtaining degrees.” The LBU program was initially designed after consulting with experts, reviewing other employer-provided education programs, and studying the research around what helps drive completion rates among adult working learners. This helped guide the initial $1 a day approach, but the economy and job market have changed, and Walmart is always looking for new ways to encourage more associates to pursue further education. “We’re also excited to add in-demand college degree and certificate options in business administration, supply chain, and cybersecurity. These additional offerings join a robust catalog of programs to set associates up for new career opportunities,” Stomski said. “Our education offerings tie directly to our growth areas at Walmart, and what better way to fill the pipeline of future talent than with our own associates.” In addition, Walmart will add four academic partners, including Johnson & Wales University, the University of Arizona, the University of Denver, and Pathstream. These complement the existing partners: Brandman University, Penn Foster, Purdue University Global, Southern New Hampshire University, Wilmington University, and Voxy EnGen. Our Live Better U program just got better. We’re proud to announce we’ll now pay 100% of college tuition and books for our associates seeking additional education, a planned investment of nearly $1 billion over the next five years. Each of these institutions were chosen for their history of success with adult and working learner programs as well as their focus on degree completion. Currently, cost is a leading barrier for earning a degree—with student loan debt in the U.S. topping $1.7 trillion. Since launching LBU in 2018, more than 52,000 associates have participated in the program to date, and 8,000 have already graduated. Nearly 28,000 associates have been active in a LBU program this summer. “As the company making one of the nation’s largest investments in education for America’s workforce, Walmart is setting a new standard for what it looks like to prepare workers for the jobs of the future,” said Rachel Carlson, CEO & co-founder of Guild Education. “Walmart is creating growth opportunities for their workforce and preparing them for the future of work.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/walmart-announces-plan-to-pay-100-of-college-tuition-for-its-workers/
"In the words of William Shakespeare, “Some are born great. Some achieve greatness. And some have greatness thrust upon them.” The same might be said for Internet fame. Just ask John Butler, an 84-year-old former farmer from Derbyshire, England. Riding a grownup tricycle, sporting a neatly coiffed beard, and often wearing a jaunty Oxford-blue beret with matching gloves, the unlikely senior citizen social media sensation has almost unwittingly become a peaceable guru to a devoted and growing legion of adoring fans. Butler, an early advocate of organic farming, is a longtime practitioner of meditation. As part of his spiritual journey, he began recording inspirational messages in hopes of imparting the lessons he’d learned to others. The tranquil tone, calming presence—and per one listener, “a voice like a warm glass of milk”—with which Butler delivered his home-spun advice online soon struck a soothing chord with the rising tide of viewers struggling to decompress from the day-to-day anxiety brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, his YouTube channel currently boasts 182,000 subscribers whose far-flung global locales definitely put the “world wide” in the world wide web. Butler’s rise to fame began with a 2016 BBC interview showcasing his mindful take on life. After the episode aired, he was singled out by members of the Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) community as someone worthy of note not just for what he said, but the manner in which he said it. (Devotees of ASMR take pleasure in the calming influence and accompanying tingling sensations triggered by whispering or other soft-spoken forms of expression.) From there, almost like a new-age Bob Ross minus a paintbrush, the octogenarian’s popularity spiraled—but no one was more surprised by his newfound notoriety than Butler himself. Having always considered himself something of a “misfit,” prior to his ongoing video project, Butler says he’d never heard of YouTube and had little working knowledge of the Internet. But no matter how his karma unfolded, Butler feels blessed to be able to provide a steadying influence for folks just doing their best to cope with modern-day life. “So many people have this problem with an agitated mind, a restless mind, and because one instinctively seeks for some sort of balance, people look for rest or peace don’t they?” Butler told the . “If something in my voice conveys that restfulness then thank God for that. I don’t know quite how it happens… but I’m just quietly glad to be able to share what I love.” ( one of John’s videos below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/former-farmer-becomes-youtube-star-at-84-years-old-asmr/
"This smart mom is saving parents money by showing them how to make intricate kids’ toys—from cardboard boxes. Engineer and mother-of-two Nazdar Tayib builds everything from kitchen sets to pirate ships—and she shares tutorial videos online for others to enjoy. Nazdar also creates toy school buses, barbecue grills, cars, washing machines, and anything else her five-year-old son and two-year-old daughter desire. “I know some parents can’t buy things for their kids, like a playhouse or play kitchens because they’re expensive, so why not make it from cardboard?,” said Nazdar, who lives in Tennessee. “I think it’s more fun to make it with your hands and your kid will love it. My son asked if I could make a pirate ship for him, so I made a pirate ship. “They said, ‘can you make a food truck for me?’ So I make a food truck.” Nazdar began making her no-budget creations two years ago and last year she started a YouTube channel, , to help other parents save money and get creative. Each toy is cleverly designed to fold up neatly for storage. “You can fold them, take them apart, and save them for later,” Nazdar said. “I put them all in my big closet and just ask my kids which one they want to play with. “Kids get bored very quickly, they play with them for a while and then they get bored. “So cardboard is great because it’s free or inexpensive and really easy to find. “I just buy some tape and washable paint, or sometimes I don’t paint them at all. It really doesn’t cost me a lot.” Each item takes Nazdar approximately four hours to make, and she encourages other parents to give it a try if they can find the time. “If you want to start, your kids are going to love it,” she said. “My kids really enjoy playing with them, and my son even helps me paint sometimes. “It’s a fun experience.” ( the video of Nazdar’s work below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/mom-makes-cardboard-box-toys-for-kids-nazdar-tayib/

And that’s literally how it started,” Katherine Marshall Kartman told . From there, people started spontaneously signing it, and moving it to different streets. Like a colossal colorful tumbleweed Ole has rolled from thoroughfare to thoroughfare, making friends wherever he goes, collecting signatures and smiles. There’s even to show its current location. Katherine Marshall Kartman wrote on Instagram: “The Stoughton Community Beach Ball greeted us first thing this morning by rolling up onto our driveway 😄🙃😜. Thanks to the Davie family for helping it get a good nights sleep…We all signed it and then sent it on its merry way, traveling north down Hilldale. Keep it rolling! #stoughtonbeachball” Ole has run into trouble a few times, like springing a leak and losing serious amounts of vital air. But, city residents like Fire Chief Josh Ripp have stepped in with patches and pumps to repair the damage, filling him back up again and sending it along for the next leg of an ongoing adventure. Stoughton Police officers have signed the ball, too, after finding it one night and jokingly calling it a “neighborhood prowler” on their . Since beach balls have a notoriously short lifespan, it’s likely the original Ole will likely be retired at the end of the season, but the jaunty orb has been such a hometown hit, there’s talk of making the “Ole Crawl” an annual event. And the growing suburban legend is spreading, with copycat inflatables now rolling down the streets of nearby communities that decided they want to play, too.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/stoughton-wisconsin-roly-poly-ole/
"When it comes to communication, the internet offers instant gratification. By their very nature, handwritten letters are more permanent. Letters create a tangible connection to the people, places, and events of the past. Ironically, when the links of that chain break, it seems the easiest way to repair them is with the speedy tools of the world wide web. Liverpool native Lance Corporal William Swift enlisted at the onset of WWI in 1914. He and his brothers in arms of the King’s Own Royal Lancaster Regiment were sent to France in 1916. After taking part in the Battle of the Somme, at age 19, Swift perished at the Battle of Arras. But Swift inadvertently left something behind while stationed at Noeux-les Mines after the Battle of the Somme. During building renovations more than a century later, a school teacher unearthed letters to Swift from his family; they were found beneath the floorboards of the soldier’s former billet. The letters were taken into the care of Mathilde Bernardet, a historian with the Memorial 14-18 museum at Notre Dame De Lorette. As reported by the , Bernardet classified the deeply moving missives as “simple letters, sent by parents who care about their son. The letters are full of support. The mum says she misses her son—she hopes he is doing well, keeping well and that she trusts in him… It’s full of love really.” Knowing the poignant ending to the Lance Corporal’s story, Bernardet and her colleagues became determined to find Swift’s living relations and return the correspondence to his family. However, the hunt for Swift’s relatives proved more difficult than anticipated. Months of research turned up no leads. With traditional means exhausted, the historian took the search to social media. The results from her Facebook plea for pertinent information were, if not instantaneous, pretty darn close. “In less than four hours, the post had been shared a few thousand times and we had [found] a few connections to the family,” Bernardet told BBC. Lance Corporal William Swift may not have made it home to Liverpool all those many years ago, but thanks to the efforts of a determined historian and some timely help from the internet, his letters will—and that long-broken chain connecting past, present, and future is now restored for generations to come.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/lance-corporal-william-swift-letters-wwi-facebook-search/

"Javier Folgar was brainstorming ways to celebrate the first anniversary of his business, and decided to create a blog post highlighting all the wonderful events that happened this past year—and he knew just where to get the photos. His mother Carmen had given him a special gift at Christmas last year. She created a scrapbook for the company that captured all his trials and triumphs—the special milestones that brought TOA Waters to where it is today. “Let me tell you, this scrapbook meant the world to me! Not only was it magnificently laid out, but it was also designed by my mother,” Javier told GNN. “It’s something that she spent hours of her time piecing together.” The business, which makes products that “nourish the body, and smell amazing,” was only a few months old at Christmas. Carmen’s plan was to hold on to the scrapbook adding additional memories throughout the year and return it to Javier at the end of September 2021 when the company hits its one-year anniversary. A few weeks ago, he drove to her home in Wayne, New Jersey, to fetch the book. “I packed up my car and prepared to make the drive back home to Frederick, Maryland,” recalled Javier. “I carefully placed the scrapbook on the top of my vehicle. I didn’t want my luggage to damage the book in any way.” He intended to put the scrapbook back into the car once everything was packed. Well, that didn’t happen—and without even realizing, he drove off with the scrapbook on top of his car. While stopping to fuel up his tank at a gas station, he checked his phone for any new emails. : “I received one new message from a woman I didn’t know. She said she found a scrapbook scattered across Valley Road. She wasn’t sure if it was mine, but she decided to reach out and give it a shot in case she could find the owner. That’s when I realized the terrible mistake that I made.” The kind Samaritan tried her best to salvage the pages and offered to bring them back to his parent’s house. “Within the next few minutes, my mother received a knock on the door. Alyssa Fiorellini was standing in front of her with the torn-up pages.” Most of them were recovered, except for five, so Carmen and her husband proceeded out to search for the missing pages, and found three more. “We were still missing my mother’s favorite page. It was a photo of her with a white bow on it. At that point, we thought it was lost forever.” “About an hour later, my parents received another knock on the door. This time it was Alyssa’s mother. Apparently, she heard the story of how her daughter recovered a scrapbook from their busy road. She looked around and also found a page, and decided to bring it back to my parents.” : It was the page Javier’s mother was searching for. “I am still in awe of the kindness shown by these two ladies. I can’t believe a mother and daughter would go out of their way to return these precious memories to us—people they have never met before.” “On top of that, I was blown away by the love of my parents. Even though I accidentally destroyed my mother’s work, my dad and mom took the time to retrieve the missing pieces.” : “When I think about it, it was very symbolic of how my parents have always looked after me, even as an adult. My mother, without hesitation, even offered to remake that scrapbook for me because she knew how much it meant to me.” “There truly is kindness around every corner,” Javier concluded.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/a-treasure-scattered-in-the-street-and-a-good-samaritan-who-delivered-kindness/
"Millennials are more adventurous with food than Baby Boomers—eating more foreign fare, experimenting with unusual ingredients, and even catching their own dinner—according to a new survey. The study of 2,000 British adults found that during an average week just 36 percent of food eaten by 25-40-year-olds is traditional to their own culture. Seven in 10 of these Millennials say they cook with rare or unknown ingredients, compared to just 7% of those aged 57-75. One-third of younger adults said they’d been fishing and served up their catch that same evening, compared to only about one-quarter of older generations who had the same experience. It also emerged that as many as 6 in 10 Millennials love cooking and use it as a great way to escape. The survey was commissioned by National Geographic to launch the third season of , which aired the first episode on September 15th at 9pm. It features Gordon Ramsay foraging for food, traveling the globe in pursuit of culinary excellence. A spokesperson for National Geographic said, “The research has been interesting to see the varying levels of adventure when it comes to food across the generations.” “And it’s been intriguing to see the numbers of people that would love to push to the next level and travel somewhere more remote for experiences of taste.” : The study also found that despite those aged 25-40 being more daring in the kitchen at home, they’re not quite as adventurous when abroad. Although millennials are more likely to deliberately travel to a country where food is exciting and new, when they get there, they’re also likely to eat in a well-known fast-food restaurant – with 37 percent saying it’s nice to have something comforting and familiar. At home, the average respondent estimated 38 percent of the dishes they eat each week are British, with boomers consuming the most (42 percent). Gen Zs are most likely to share their love of food with those around them, with three quarters saying they’ve been known to introduce new dishes to family members. In fact, across all respondents polled via OnePoll, 36 percent have a recipe or way of cooking that has been passed down the generations to them—with an average of two secret ingredients. : When asked what is considered ‘adventurous’ when it comes to food, eating local cuisine abroad, ordering something unusual off the menu they’ve never tried before, and adding something new to a dish were all mentioned. One-third believed trying a new store-bought sauce counts as being daring. If you’re not quite as daring as others, you can get inspiration from the professionals on cooking shows such as ’s or Stanley Tucci’s . In this upcoming season, Ramsay hits the road and feasts his way through Portugal, Croatia, Mexico, Texas, Maine, Puerto Rico, Iceland and America’s Smoky Mountains, looking for global cuisines and unique culinary customs.

"– Temperatures were pushing 100 degrees in East Sacramento on July 9. Still, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Sacramento District’s contractors and construction workers made steady progress on the Sacramento River East Levee project, until a contractor noticed something out of place. Among the bustle of activity, contract worker Roberto Navarez spotted two gray, baby birds sitting on the levee, right in the path of a massive bulldozer shoving along a mound of dirt. He noticed several long branches from a huge oak tree stretched over the levee, but he couldn’t see a nest anywhere in the tree. Assuming the chicks had fallen or jumped out of their nest, Navarez continued to watch the pair, hoping they would soon be rounded up by their parents. Unfortunately, neither the mother nor father bird appeared. With construction equipment rumbling past and the mid-day heat now topping 104 degrees, Navarez knew the chicks needed to be moved out of harm’s way, and fast. Feeling apprehensive about moving them himself, he reached out to wildlife biologist Pete Morris of Nordic, the SREL Contract 2 project contractor. Arriving on scene, Morris observed the birds and decided the pair of chicks must be taken out of the withering heat if they were to have a chance of survival. He then retrieved a small cardboard box, and the two rogue chicks were gently scooped up and taken back to the Army Corps of Engineering (USACE) trailer. Once inside the air-conditioned building, the larger of the two chicks immediately managed to get out of the box and began hopping around, interacting with rescuers and “chirping its lungs out.” The smaller sibling, however, seemed to be struggling. It remained quiet and listless, hunkered down in the makeshift nest. Unsure of what to do next, someone brought up the name of Lee Roork. Working on the levee as a Quality Assurance Representative for USACE, Roork was known to be an avid birder. He could often be seen on his breaks or at lunchtime checking out birds and nests with his binoculars. Roork had also been known to take injured owls or hawks to various wildlife sanctuaries around Sacramento in the past, so he seemed the right person to contact. : Roork knew the ideal fix was to return the wayward chicks back to the tree they had fallen from in hopes that one of the parent birds would return to collect them. He mashed up some blackberries and seeds, providing some nourishment for obviously ravenous babies, then returned to place the box and birds back in the tree. But as soon as the cardboard “nest” was attached to a branch, the larger of the two chicks leapt from the box. An adult scrub jay immediately swooped down and started interacting with the chick as both hastily scampered into nearby brush. As Roork returned to work, the smaller, weaker bird remained in the nest, but Roork wanted to give the parent birds time to return and take care of their baby. He said he made intermittent checks throughout the rest of the day, but found that neither parent would go near the “nest” containing the abandoned baby Jay. By the end of the business day, it was looking pretty grim for the lone nestling, said Roork. “I was certain the little bird wouldn’t survive another 24 hours unless someone helped it. It was in pretty bad shape, so I decided to try to help it, rather than leave it to die,” said Roork. He then sent a one-sentence text to his wife, Susan Roork (also a USACE employee, who was teleworking from home not far from the SREL site). “Want to raise a baby scrub jay?” the text read. Susan, an animal enthusiast who also has plenty of experience with rescues, sent back a one-word response … “Definitely!” Susan went into research mode, scouring bird rescue sites for pertinent information and discovered that scrub jays eat everything from soft cat food and meal worms to local berries, fruits, and seeds. What they never did discover was whether “Blu Blu” (the name that stuck) was a male or female. “Their coloring and markings look extraordinarily similar,” said Susan.” So, we just went with ‘her’ most of the time.” A bigger question remained, however: would Blu even pull through? For the first 24 hours, Blu barely moved. She sat limply, hunkered down in her newly created home-nest. But by the second day, Susan was able to get some food and water into her. The transformation was incredible. : “She started wholeheartedly interacting with us, eagerly taking water through a little hypodermic dispenser, gobbling down healthy portions of food, acting alert, responsive and curious – she was making her way,” said Susan. From that point on, Blu’s future never seemed in doubt. She continued to grow stronger, increase in appetite and grow faster than Susan and Lee thought possible. “We were absolutely amazed by how quickly she grew,” said Susan. “We would go to bed and when we’d check on her the next day it was like looking at a new bird – feathers appearing where there were none before, her tail feathers would be an inch longer, her feet and little talons growing fast.” : From the very beginning, Susan, Lee and their teenaged daughter, Jillian, approached taking care of Blu with an end goal in mind – releasing her back to the wild. To do so, they tried to nudge Blu into doing things it would have to do in the wild, such as finding its food, cracking nuts, capturing flies, and building her flying prowess. But they also found that Blu had many of these traits ingrained in her DNA, and she quickly began taking food and hiding it in various locations inside the house for eating later. “Our biggest concern was whether Blu would be able to learn all the things she would need to survive out in the real world,” said Susan. “We felt that it was important to make sure she had challenges and tasks to figure out, as she would when we released her, so we regularly came up with problems for her to work out. We were always amazed at how quickly she figured out each one and mastered the skills involved. In the first weeks, little Blue was literally Susan’s pet project. As Lee worked on the levee, and Jillian attended school, Blu was teleworking with Susan, pecking at the keyboard to help her type, hopping about and creating mischief – along with the occasional typo – tugging on her earrings, flitting about, stealing sticky-notes … only to suddenly snuggle into a ball of fluff, falling asleep on her wrist, or snuggling warmly against her neck. : “Blu had become a great companion, and I knew I would miss her dearly when we released her,” said Susan. “But even though we had all become very attached to Blu and loved the experience of raising her, the ultimate plan to release her was not in question.” With two months of the Roork’s care, Blu’s transition was stunning. As of late August, she had made the full transition from a chick on the edge of death to a strong and smart scrub jay ready for the great outdoors. Blu had attained expert aerial acrobat status, regularly zooming throughout the house, finding stashed peanuts, catching flies in mid-air, messily bathing in a blue frisbee, and generally acting like an adult bird. And she was spending more and more time staring out the window … Recognizing Blu’s progress, Susan and Lee decided that Blu’s launch-to-nature date would be over the Labor Day holiday. And even knowing from the start that they would give Blu her freedom to fly, both admitted that they were entirely smitten by the feisty, feathered creature. “For a brief moment, we considered turning our large chicken coup into a bird sanctuary for her … but we knew it wouldn’t be fair,” said Susan. Lee quickly agreed. They planned to take Blu’s dog crate-sized sanctuary into the backyard, sit with her for a while, let her acclimate to being outside, and, when they could finally swallow their doubts (and their hearts), they would open the door and see if Blu was ready for the big blue sky. Then, just as unexpectedly as the little bird had come into their lives, Blu was gone. During a visit from a neighbor, Blu made the decision for all involved, and darted through the slightly opened front door and into nearby trees. She squawked and fussed at Susan for a few moments, but continued to move from tree to tree, getting further and further from the house. Finally, Susan saw Blu join some other scrub jays and begin flying along with them. “Even though the plan was always to release her, we were both heartbroken. But only because we were disappointed we didn’t get to make it an official goodbye,” said Susan. Still, despite the way it ended, both Susan and Lee said it was a wonderful, once-in-a-lifetime experience. “This has been a unique experience to say the least,” said Lee. “I would never have brought this baby bird home unless I truly believed it was not going to make it. I had no idea how demanding these little guys could be and how much care they need. But I do believe we have done what we could to help her survive in the wild.” Offering a bit of closure, Blu returned to some trees alongside the Roork’s home shortly after her departure. Susan said they had a final “conversation,” as Blu jumped from branch to branch, excitedly chittering and shadowing them as they walked down the street.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/rescued-from-bulldozers-baby-bird-steals-hearts-before-its-return-to-nature/
"A South Africa-based nonprofit conservation group that manages 19 protected areas on the continent has secured a donation of $100,000,000. The grant from the Rob and Melani Walton Foundation was pledged to African Parks, which manages parks in eleven African countries One of the largest contributions ever made to conservation in Africa, this commitment will help to expand African Parks’ reach, preserving a significant portion of Africa’s biodiversity for the long-term benefit of local people and the animals. Founded in 2000, African Parks takes on the long-term management of protected areas in partnership with governments to protect wildlife, restore landscapes, and ensure sustainable livelihoods for surrounding communities. Currently managing 19 parks measuring almost 57,000 square-miles (14.7m hectares), they take on the complete responsibility and are accountable for all aspects of protected area management, including law enforcement, community development, sustainable financing, infrastructure, and overall governance. : With more than 3,200 full-time staff, 98% of whom are from local communities, and thousands of part-time staff, African Parks has become the largest employer in many regions in which they work. Poaching has been curtailed and practically eliminated in most of the parks under their management, where more than 80% of key wildlife populations are on the rise. In the last year alone, 110,000 people received healthcare from the hospitals and mobile clinics they support, and over 100,000 children had access to education provided by the schools they support around the parks. Their goal is to directly manage 30 parks measuring over 30 million hectares by 2030. This would bolster African governments’ efforts to help reach the global target of protecting 30% of the planet for nature. Rob and Melani Walton are longtime supporters of sustainability and conservation efforts around the globe and have been invaluable partners to African Parks since its inception. “As global citizens, we have a responsibility to protect our planet and the people and species that create our dynamic, fragile ecosystems. We are honored to continue to work alongside African Parks, governments across the continent, and community leaders in support of their sustainability goals,” said Melani Walton of the , an African Parks Board Member. : The $100M commitment will be allocated over the next five years, with $75M going to the creation of an endowment, which ensures long-term funding. The remaining $25M will go to sustaining parks under African Parks’ management that need it the most. A portion of these funds will be used for five-year matching grants in conjunction with the Legacy Landscapes Fund—to both Iona National Park in Angola and to Odzala-Kokoua National Park in the Republic of Congo, with an additional $10M for each park over the subsequent 10 years. “This could not come at a more important time… providing a source of stable long-term funding that will contribute enduring protection for some of the most biodiverse, threatened landscapes on the planet,” said CEO Peter Fearnhead. : “This extraordinary gift will help to realize our vision of protecting vast ecosystems and their ecological functions for humanity in perpetuity.” Fearnhead said the gift was the largest-ever to its endowment, following a 2017 donation of $65 million from the Wyss Foundation to support several parks. With the new funding, African Parks will be able to continue to increase their impact by bringing more parks under management, continue to reduce poaching, increase wildlife populations, and improve livelihoods for hundreds of thousands of people across Africa.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/african-parks-gets-100-million-donation/
"Oregon State University researchers have some good news for the well-meaning masses who place bird feeders in their yards: The small songbirds who visit the feeders seem unlikely to develop an unhealthy reliance on them. “There’s still much we don’t know about how intentional feeding might induce changes in wild bird populations, but our study suggests that putting out food for small birds in winter will not lead to an increased dependence on human-provided food,” said Jim Rivers, an animal ecologist with the OSU College of Forestry. Around the globe each year, hundreds of millions of people put out food for wildlife, including 50 million in the United States alone, driving a $4 billion industry based on food, feeders, and other accessories. But the popular pastime has long raised concerns about making animals dependent on human-provided food—especially during wintertime and other parts of the annual cycle that require animals to expend a lot of energy. “The extensive and widespread nature of people intentionally feeding wildlife can have unintended consequences for free-ranging animal populations, and those consequences are best documented in birds,” Rivers said. “On the negative side, it can facilitate disease transmission, restructure local communities, and alter migration behavior, for example. There’s even evidence that it can lead to changes to birds’ bill structure. On the other hand, it can also have positive effects, such as enhanced body condition, wintertime survival, and reproductive output.” Bird feeding is especially popular in the northern latitudes, particularly during winter, when cold, stormy weather and minimal daylight reduce the time that birds have for locating natural foods. But not much is known, Rivers said, about whether birds become reliant on the feed their human friends toss out for them. “The only manipulative experiment to test that, using the black-capped chickadee, was 30 years ago,” he said. “It found no reductions in apparent survival after removal of bird feeders that had provided supplemental food in winter for 25 years, leading to the conclusion that bird feeding did not promote feeder dependency.” Rivers and colleagues studied the feeder use habits of 67 black-capped chickadees subjected to one of three flight-feather-clipping treatments: heavy clipping, light clipping or, as the control, no clipping. Experimental removal of primary flight feathers is an established technique for altering wing loading and increasing the energy costs of flight, Rivers said. The birds were tagged with RFID chips, and 21 bird feeders along a 3.2 kilometer riparian zone were filled with sunflower seeds and equipped with chip readers to measure feeder visits by tagged birds. Scientists chose the chickadee because it is a small songbird (it weighs less than half an ounce) that frequents bird feeders during winter throughout its range; has high daily energy requirements; and typically takes one seed at each feeder visit, allowing for a clear measure of feeder visitation rate. “It’s an ideal species for evaluating how energetic challenges lead to behavioral changes in feeder use during winter,” Rivers said. “Our study found that the experimentally handicapped chickadees, those experiencing elevated flight costs, did not increase their rates of visitation to the feeders.” Instead, feather-clipped birds actually decreased their feeder use for a couple of weeks— possibly to reduce exposure to predation—but after that used the feeders at levels similar to the unclipped control birds. The researchers looked at number of feeder visits, number of feeders used and timing of feeder visits and found little difference between clipped and non-clipped chickadees. “Feather-clipped chickadees reducing their use of feeders relative to control birds suggests that foods in the environment—like seeds, berries and small invertebrates—were sufficiently available to compensate for increased flight costs and allowed them to cut back on feeder use,” Rivers said. “It’s clear that the chickadees in our study did not increase their visitation rates nor did they increase their reliance on supplemental feed during a period when they might have benefited from it the most.” Findings from the research, which looked at black-capped chickadees outfitted with radio frequency identification tags, were published in the .",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/study-says-feeding-birds-not-bad/

"The ‘Amazon of Europe’—a victory for nature 12 years in the making, has finally come to pass as a transboundary UNESCO Biosphere Reserve covering five nations. Protecting the valuable and vulnerable riverine and estuarine ecosystems of the Rivers Danube, Mura, and Drava, the reserve spans Croatia, Serbia, Hungary, Austria, and Slovenia. Similar to its famous “World Heritage Sites,” UNESCO Biosphere Reserves represent a high level of international protection and recognition for the finest ecosystems in the world, and ones which are critical to maintaining the biosphere—the global web of life. The Mura-Drava-Danube Transboundary Reserve (MDD) 1,150 square-miles (300k ha) of core wilderness, and 2,700 square-miles of transitionary and buffer zones (700k ha). The buffer zones contain relatively pristine and related microsystems like wetlands, fish ponds, and oxbow lakes, while the transitionary zones maintain modest human habitation such as villages, ecotourism businesses, and agriculture. “This is the most valuable connected river landscape in Central Europe and does not need to shy away from being compared with the Amazon,” WWF project coordinator Arno Mohl, who advocated for the MDD for over a decade. The seed for the project was sown in 2009 when Croatia and Hungary stating their shared desire to see such a reserve come into being, which was followed just two years later by Serbia, Slovenia, and Austria. In 2011, UNESCO began reviewing borders and habitat in each country before designating a biosphere in each one, always with the idea of combining them. Even in a continent as crowded as Europe, the reserve is a sign that nature can maintain bastions around us, and the MDD is the first Biosphere Reserve to cross the borders of so many nations. “The five countries involved prove that nature conservation can overcome country borders for the benefit of everyone. In the context of the current climate crisis and massive species extinction, protecting the last natural areas has become a matter of our survival,” Mohl continued. Representing such an important body of water, it’s unsurprising perhaps that it’s a refuge for imperiled species like the black stork, otter, beavers, little tern, sturgeon, and the highest density of European white eagles, along with 36 species of native Slovenian fish on the IUCN Red List. In Slovenia, the River Mura is the only stretch of water not separated by dams, meaning fish can migrate from its headwaters all the way to the Danube Delta where it flows into the Black Sea.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/worlds-first-5-nation-biosphere-reserve-protects-the-amazon-of-europe/
"In Vancouver, a new supermarket is opening specifically to get unwanted food and produce into the hands of people who need or want it, thereby sparing it from being dumped into the landfill. The Food Stash Foundation’s “ ” is opening its doors on October 1st. Located on 340 West 2nd Avenue, for three hours every Friday, their surplus produce and food is available to anyone, whether they’re food insecure, looking to reduce their environmental impact, or simply need to cut down on grocery costs, on a “pay what you feel” rather than “what you can” basis, ensuring there’s as little moral impediment to getting the food out the door and onto dinner tables around Vancouver. Shoppers are encouraged to bring their own bags, but if it slips one’s mind, they offer reusable totes at a limit of one per person. And getting it out the door is both the major challenge and goal, as Food Stash Foundation’s executive Carla Pellegrini would explain to GNN, 58% of all food produced in Canada . The household food waste in the Great White North is 20 kilograms more per capita than the United States, and rivals poorer nations that have limited access to refrigeration and have to deal with tropical heat and humidity. “There’s food waste at every level [of the supply-chain], whether it’s over-ordering, cancelled orders, the shape of the produce isn’t meeting the customer expectations, or approaching best-before dates,” says Pellegrini, who took over the position of director last July. “I was really, really surprised by how much food waste there is, how much food insecurity there is in Vancouver.” The collects food from wholesalers, grocers, and farms, and delivers it to other organizations that combat food waste and food insecurity. There was a time when all the unwanted food that was left would be put into boxes and delivered to food insecure families for a small price. But hauling in 70,000 pounds of food per month meant they needed more ways to get rid of it, hence the Rescued Food Market. “85% of that 70,000 pounds of food doesn’t even make it back to our warehouse, it goes right back out the same day with our drivers to other organizations,” says Pellegrini. “We even end up with surplus at the end of our weekly operations; after the organizations and the boxes, we still sometimes have surplus, so we’re interested in offloading that.” Furthermore, a piece of B.C. legislation releases donators of the liability of risk posed by donating food that’s past a best-by date, and has encouraged more donations also of packaged food and not only produce.

"Half a decade ago, the curiosity of a 10-year-old boy helped ignite a love affair with birds that have swept up his village and helped bolster support for the protection of migratory raptors passing through the southern Philippines. It all started when Joriden Ligoyligoy saw a group of strangers scanning the sky with binoculars from atop a hill in his village of Rio del Pilar, near the southernmost tip of Sarangani province on the island of Mindanao. With the curiosity of a child’s mind, Ligoyligoy climbed the hill to find out what they were doing. To his delight, the strangers, who introduced themselves as birdwatchers, allowed him to peek through their powerful telescope and binoculars. The boy was awed to see a close-up of what he was told were raptors, or birds of prey, coming from China and Taiwan, among other countries. With one peep through the scope, Ligoyligoy was hooked. “These migrating raptors are a sight to behold,” says Ligoyligoy, now 15 years old. “They take away my stress. I enjoyed watching these mighty birds.” Since that day five years ago, if he’s not doing household chores or running odd errands to help support his poor family, Ligoyligoy volunteers as a watcher in the annual raptor monitoring alongside members of Raptorwatch Network Philippines and officials from the Sarangani provincial government. Ligoyligoy, who is in the ninth grade, can identify the raptors, known locally as , passing through the village like they’re his best buddies, earning him the moniker the Raptor Boy of Sarangani. Before he became the local poster boy for raptor watching, Ligoyligoy says he used to hunt birds using a slingshot in his mountainous village for fun or food. But the chance encounter with the birdwatchers shifted his mentality. Now, in addition to appealing to his fellow youths in his neighborhood to stop hunting birds, he also rallies the community members to refrain from cutting trees in the mountains to protect the roosting sites of the migratory birds. “We need to protect these raptors because they are helpful in eradicating pests in the farms like destructive insects and rats,” Ligoyligoy tells Mongabay. While there have been extensive studies conducted on the endangered endemic ( ), one of the world’s largest raptors, there’s a dearth of study on the birds of prey passing through the Philippines during their seasonal migrations. Since it began investigating the raptors’ migration routes in 2013, Raptorwatch Philippines has established five study areas along the birds’ flyways, from Luzon in the north down to Mindanao in the south. One of those sites is Sarangani Raptor Hill at Rio del Pilar, recognized as a pit stop for migratory birds. The research site was established in 2016 by Raptorwatch Philippines in partnership with the Sarangani provincial government’s Environmental Protection and Conservation Center (ECPC). The Japanese Society for the Preservation of Birds (JSPB) and the Asian Raptor Research and Conservation Network (ARRCN) also helped in the conservation of the raptors’ flyway. In collaboration with the Sarangani provincial government, the conservation groups have established a database of migratory raptors in Glan, the municipality in which the village of Rio del Pilar is located. Monitoring is usually done from September to October, when the birds travel south from their breeding grounds in Russia, China, Japan and Taiwan to reach the warmer climates of the Philippines and Indonesia. (In March and April, the birds make their return migration north.) In the past five years, researchers at Sarangani Raptor Hill have documented hundreds of thousands of raptors flying south. Two mountains near the observatory station, Mount Taltak and Mount Gulo, have been identified as roosting sites for these migratory birds. Lawyer Alex Tiongco, head of Raptorwatch Philippines and colleague Teresa Cervero have documented at least 10 purely migratory species as well as five migratory species that have sedentary populations in the Philippines. During their count last year, the ECPC spotted 111,664 raptors. The count included 109,874 Chinese sparrowhawks ( ); 1,784 gray-faced buzzards ( ); three western ospreys ( ); and a crested honey buzzard ( ). None of these species is considered threatened on the IUCN Red List. The 2020 count was low due to bad weather stemming from the at least seven typhoons that hit the Philippines during the monitoring period, says Roy Mejorada, a veterinarian at the Sarangani ECPC. But prior to that, the numbers showed a rising trend. In 2019, the total raptor count was 161,719; up from 106,685 in 2018, 132,945 in 2017, and 78,817 in 2016. The increase in Glan’s raptor visitors could be attributed to the increase in the community’s awareness in conserving the raptors, Mejorada says. While the five-year monitoring program ended on Oct. 31, Mejorada says they are hoping to get continued or new sponsorships to sustain the study. Tiongco says raptors are natural indicators of the health of the environment. They sit atop the food chain, thus their health depends on the health of the whole ecosystem they live in, the ARRCN said in a briefer. Declines in their populations can indicate a problem in the specific ecosystem that raptor species depend upon or visit, it added. Raptors are also beneficial to human food security and livelihoods. “These raptors are natural predators,” Tiongco tells Mongabay. “If their population will decrease, the population of farm pests along their migratory path will increase as a result of the disruption, affecting agricultural productivity and the livelihood of the people.” During their initial discovery of Sarangani Raptor Hill more than five years ago, curious schoolchildren would join Tiongco and his team up on the hill. The team took the opportunity to educate the youngsters on the importance of the raptors. As the days passed, the children brought their friends and parents and spread the word to other community members, Tiongco recalled during an international webinar on raptor migration organized by Udayana University in Bali, Indonesia, on October 31 2020. Eventually, Tiongco says, the team conducted “education caravans” involving youths and students to raise awareness about the migratory raptors and their vital role in the environment. “Our little monitoring venture became a major town affair,” Tiongco says, noting that provincial governors and municipal mayors and their department heads lauded their initiative and some even joined raptor-watching events organized by the group. As part of the efforts to protect the roosting sites of both the migratory raptors and resident species such as ( ) and serpent eagles, Mejorada noted the ECPC, Raptorwatch Philippines, JSPB and ARRCN had launched a reforestation project in the area involving community members in 2018. The reforestation project was designed to support the health or augment the incomes of community members, Mejorada says. That’s why they planted fruit-bearing trees such as (jackfruit), (soursop), ( ), (cotton fruit), and (sugar apple or sweetsop), among others. The community members also planted hardwood species such as , and that, as part of the agreement, should not be cut down when they mature, Mejorada says. In 2018, the USAID-funded project Protect Wildlife also conducted an education and awareness campaign for community members on the conservation of raptors. In 2018 and 2019, the locality, which is popular among local tourists for its fine white-sand beaches, celebrated the raptor festival at Sarangani Raptor Hill. Last year’s event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but in April 2020, the municipal government of Glan approved an ordinance declaring every September to October as “Langyaw Langgam Festival” (Raptor Festival), signaling its willingness to continue the efforts to conserve the flyway of the migratory birds. According to the ordinance, the birds constitute a major potential ecotourism draw for the municipality, thus making it important to increase awareness and promote environmental conservation among local communities. The new law also prohibits the hunting, killing or possession of a migratory bird, and the taking or destruction of eggs or nests. Violators are subject to fines of 1,000 to 2,500 pesos ($20 to $50), community service of three to five days, or imprisonment of up to six months. To encourage vigilance, the person reporting an alleged violation is eligible to receive 40% of the fine amount, with the rest split equally between the village and municipal governments. The ordinance also appropriates 150,000 pesos ($3,000) annually for activities or programs related to the raptor festival. In Glan, Tiongco says hunting is not much of a problem, but convincing community members of the need to protect the migratory birds’ roosting sites is more of a challenge. “By and large, the community wasn’t aware that these raptors are from other countries until five years ago,” ECPC’s Mejorada says. “They don’t know that they are part of the migratory path of these birds.” Tiongco says he is confident the birds will continue to fly across the Philippines during the migratory season with the support shown by local governments, communities and other stakeholders along the raptors’ flyway. Raptorwatch Philippines and its partners across Asia will continue to educate the public on the importance of conserving the raptors, he says. While international support is important, Tiongco says local communities must always be at the core of raptor conservation efforts because they are familiar with the flight behavior of the birds, and because these communities are the ones that will either be adversely affected or benefit from the destruction or protection of the environment. In the village of Rio del Pilar, conservation awareness of the migratory raptors appears to have taken root among community members, including religious authorities. Vilma Payon, a local pastor with the Philippine General Council of the Evangelical Church of God, says she reminds her flock about the need to protect the environment, including the migratory birds, during Sunday sermons. 61-year-old Payon is also the grandmother of Joriden Ligoyligoy, the “raptor boy”; she says humans and other living beings suffer when the environment is destroyed or degraded. To get the message clearly and easily across to young churchgoers that they need to protect the migratory birds, she says she uses the mother-child relationship as an illustration. “When a child is lost, the mother will often exhaust all means to find the child. So if you take away the baby birds from the nest, the mother will look for them and get hurt if they can’t be found,” Payon says. She says the sermon works: the children ask their peers or even older folk to release birds they’ve captured. “Every living thing is a creation of God,” Payon tells Mongabay. “We need to protect them because they have a purpose in the scheme of things on Earth.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/joriden-ligoyligoy-raptor-boy-philippines/
"Recreational vehicles are a great way to tour the country and see the sights, but thanks to the efforts of one dedicated father-daughter team, they’ve also become a lifeline for people who’ve lost their homes to California’s latest spate of devastating wildfires. The brainchild of Woody Faircloth, the nonprofit pairs folks who are willing to donate their campers to a worthy cause with those in need. To date, Faircloth—often with his 9-year-old daughter Luna along for the ride—has delivered 95 motorhomes to California area wildfire victims who otherwise might wait months for emergency housing. (The organization currently has 100 families on its waiting list.) Faircloth first got the idea for the charity in 2018. Like many that year, the Colorado-based father was tuned to news coverage of California’s deadly Camp Fire that incinerated 153,336 acres and destroyed hundreds of homes during Thanksgiving week. The story of a man who’d lost pretty much everything but managed to escape the inferno in his mobile home resonated with Faircloth. Inspired by how blessed that man felt just to have a place to spend the holiday, he asked Luna what she thought about finding an RV and delivering it to a family so they could have a place to call home for Christmas. “We were watching some of what’s going on out there and talking about what if that was us and what would we do,” Faircloth told at the time. “And I told (my daughter) what the idea was and she was 100 percent on board. She said, ‘God and Santa Claus would be really proud of us for this.’” Faircloth launched a GoFundMe campaign to finance the first RV that he and Luna delivered dropped off in California. As word of their journey spread, people started reaching out to him via social media, offering to donate their motorhomes—and from there, EmergencyRV soon took shape. A father of four who works in the telecom industry, Faircloth says even though juggling the many facets of his life has its challenges, he plans to expand EmergencyRV’s outreach to include more fire and other natural disaster sites and hopes to beef up response times as well. Over the last two months, Faircloth and Luna have made the 40-hour-roundtrip from Denver to California and back on three separate weekends. Many of the mobile home recipients are firefighters and other first responders whose tireless efforts battling the blazes did not prevent their own homes from going up in flames. One such man is George Wolley, who lost his own home to the Dixie Fire on August 4th. “We fought the fire until we couldn’t fight it no more. We couldn’t stop it. We did our best,” Wolley told the . “Before I got that RV, I felt like I was a burden on everybody that helped me… I slept a lot in tents and in my car. It gave me a place to go.” While his organization continues to grow and evolve, the original sentiments behind Faircloth’s humanitarian efforts remain constant. He’s grateful for the many blessings he has—and blessed to be in a position to help others. “Presently collapsed in the back of an old RV beside this little kid with no front teeth who gets me up and moving every day determined to do something better than yesterday,” Faircloth wrote in a when Luna was 6. “We are so lucky to be exhausted. We are so lucky to be able to go home soon. There are so many thanks yous to say that have not yet been said so to all of you—thank you.” And we’re lucky to have a world with people like Woody and Luna Faircloth in it.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/man-delivers-donated-rvs-to-wildfire-victims/
"New scientific research conducted at White Sands National Park in New Mexico has uncovered the oldest known human footprints in North America. The discovery reveals evidence of human occupation in the Tularosa Basin beginning at least 23,000 years ago, thousands of years earlier than previously thought. “These incredible discoveries illustrate that White Sands National Park is not only a world-class destination for recreation but is also a wonderful scientific laboratory that has yielded groundbreaking, fundamental research,” said Superintendent Marie Sauter. The fossilized human footprints were buried in multiple layers of gypsum soil on a large playa in White Sands National Park. Seeds embedded in the footprints were radiocarbon dated and analyzed by the U.S. Geological Survey to establish their age. The research dramatically extends the range for the coexistence of humans and Pleistocene (ice age) megafauna and confirms that humans were present in North America before the major glacial advances at the height of the last ice age closed migration routes from Asia. “This study illustrates the process of science—new evidence can shift long held paradigms,” said USGS Acting Rocky Mountain Regional Director Allison Shipp. White Sands National Park contains the world’s largest-known collection of Pleistocene age (ice age) fossilized footprints in the world and has been recognized as a megatracksite since 2014. Those footprints havebeen given the intriguing nickname “ghost tracks.” Each footprint marks the spot where an ancient ancestor once stood many thousands of years ago. The newly discovered “ghost tracks” tell an interesting tale of what life was like at this time. “The footprints left at White Sands give a picture of what was taking place, teenagers interacting with younger children and adults,” said lead study author, Matthew Bennett from Bournemouth University, in a . “We can think of our ancestors as quite functional, hunting and surviving, but what we see here is also activity of play, and of different ages coming together. A true insight into these early people.” In addition to human footprints, tracks from the Columbian mammoth, saber-toothed cat, dire wolf, and other ice age animals have been discovered at White Sands. Scientists from White Sands National Park, the National Park Service, U.S. Geological Survey, Bournemouth University, University of Arizona, and Cornell University, in connection with the park’s Native American partners, have collaborated and consulted on this research. The findings are detailed in an article published in the journal White Sands National Park protects and preserves the world’s largest gypsum dunefield, at least 23,000 years of archaeology, adaptive flora and fauna, as well as Works Progress Administration-era historic pueblo buildings.

"The Kidney Project’s implantable bioartificial kidney, one that promises to free kidney disease patients from dialysis machines and transplant waiting lists, took another big step toward becoming reality—earning a $650,000 prize from KidneyX for its first-ever demonstration of a functional prototype of its implantable artificial kidney. KidneyX is a public–private partnership between the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the American Society of Nephrology, founded to “accelerate innovation in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney diseases.” The Kidney Project, a nationwide collaboration, combined the two essential parts of its artificial kidney, the hemofilter and the bioreactor, and successfully implanted the smartphone-sized device for preclinical evaluation. For this advance, the team was awarded KidneyX’s Phase 1 Artificial Kidney Prize and was one of six winning teams selected out of an international field. In the last few years, The Kidney Project successfully tested the hemofilter, which removes waste products and toxins from blood, and the bioreactor, which replicates other kidney functions, like the balance of electrolytes in blood, in separate experiments. For the Artificial Kidney Prize, the team married the two units into a scaled-down version of the artificial kidney and evaluated its performance in a preclinical model. The units worked in tandem, powered by blood pressure alone, and without the need for blood thinning or immunosuppressant drugs. “The vision for the artificial kidney is to provide patients with complete mobility and better physiological outcomes than dialysis,” said Roy, who is a faculty member of the UCSF Schools of Pharmacy and Medicine. “It promises a much higher quality of life for millions worldwide with kidney failure.” Chronic kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease, leads to the progressive and dangerous loss of kidney function. Most patients with kidney failure must visit dialysis clinics multiple times every week to have their blood filtered, a process that is time-consuming, uncomfortable, and risky. A minority of patients live with transplanted kidneys, thanks to a pool of donated kidneys that are constantly in high demand. But even these patients must contend with a lifetime on immunosuppressant drugs that can have severe side effects. The Kidney Project’s artificial kidney will not only replicate the high quality of life seen in kidney transplant recipients—the “gold standard” of kidney disease treatment, according to Roy—but also spare them from needing to take immunosuppressants. “Our team engineered the artificial kidney to sustainably support a culture of human kidney cells without provoking an immune response,” said Roy. “Now that we have demonstrated the feasibility of combining the hemofilter and bioreactor, we can focus on upscaling the technology for more rigorous preclinical testing, and ultimately, clinical trials.” The KidneyX Artificial Kidney Prize called on scientists and engineers to submit “continuous kidney replacement therapies that provide transformational treatment options beyond current dialysis methods,” a high bar that UCSF’s artificial kidney is poised to clear in the coming years. “This award is a testament to The Kidney Project’s bold vision and execution of a viable solution for millions of patients with kidney failure,” said UCSF School of Pharmacy Dean B.

"Among what must have been hundreds of thousands of stories of sacrifice, heroism, and courage that played out among the Jewish communities across Europe during World War Two, the story of ‘Mr. Radio Philips’, aka ‘The Angel of Curaçao’, has never been well told. But 45 years after his death, Jan Zwartendijk, an ordinary Dutch company man-turned-real hero, is now the subject of a new biography called which details his life-saving bravery that saved perhaps 10,000 Jews from annihilation during the Holocaust by helping them flee Europe. In 1939, Zwartendijk took over duties as consulate in the then-capital of Lithuania, Kaunas, on behalf of the Dutch government-in-exile after the Netherlands was occupied by Nazi Germany. A loyal company man for the home goods brand Philips, he sold gramophones, lightbulbs, and other goods out of the Kaunas branch before his reliability earned him the unpaid position as consul. Soon after taking over, Jewish refugees from Poland—who fled following the Red Army’s invasion in 1940—began to arrive at his door seeking help. Confronted with a dangerous choice, Zwartendijk did what “everyone would have done… if they had been in this position,” according to his son, recounting his father’s words to the Guardian. He ended up issuing 2,139 passport visas to Jewish families for entry into the Dutch Caribbean colony of Curaçao, knowing that his signature of fountain pen script and green stamp could get them as far as the island—after which he could only hope the local authorities, whose approval was also needed for the Jews to enter the country, would allow them in. Zwartendijk’s gamble would end up saving more people than Oskar Schindler—subject of the Academy-Award winning says journalist Jennifer Rankin . While it was the Dutchman whose visas allowed those fleeing the war to find a new home, he was not the only brave soul working as a consul in the Lithuanian capital at the time. Japan’s ensure, through the long arm of the Trans-Siberian Railway, that the refugees had a reliable way of escaping Europe. Sugihara and Zwartendijk were both denounced by their governments, but would later be honored as heroes—though it took quite a bit longer for Zwartendijk to be recognized. Sugihara was named ‘Righteous Among the Nations’, the highest honor accorded to non-Jews by the state of Israel, two years before he died in 1986. Furthermore, he has a section in Japanese school curriculums, a decent Wikipedia page, memorials, and more. Zwartendijk, on the other hand, was largely forgotten and did not receive the ‘Righteous Among the Nations’ honor until 1997. Yet a week after his death in 1976, writes Jan Brokken, author of research was published which estimated that 95% of all the people leaving Europe on a Zwartendijk visa escaped to freedom. Since then, the Kaunas municipality has raised a memorial for Mr. Radio Philips in front of the corporate office he used to occupy. It’s a worthy recognition of a man the history books will not forget again. On reading the biography of his life, Stephen Spielberg wrote, “If I had known Jan Zwartendijk’s story before, I would have had filmed that.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/dutch-mr-radio-philips-who-saved-thousands-during-the-holocaust/
"When one man just couldn’t find the perfect pasta shape, he did what so many great Americans have done before him: he made his own. The story of this fun adventure raises many important food-isophical questions, such as “What is the best pasta shape?” and “What attributes do the best pasta shapes have?” and “Who decides what represents an official pasta shape: is there even such a thing?” Dan Pashman, James Beard Award winner, food personality, and podcast host, decided that whether it was penne, rigatoni, tagliatelle, or tortellini, there was no pasta form which he thought satisfied his desire for “sauceability,” “forkability” and “tooth-sinkability.” Along the way towards his ultimate goal of the perfect pasta, that Pashman traveled to something called the Pasta Lab in North Dakota State University, where he learned at the knees of pasta elders about the science behind the worldwide staple. Afterwards he went to the factories of Sfoglini, a Brooklyn pasta brand that uses more refined drying and packaging techniques, as well as the finest organic durum wheat to make their shapes. also details that they use bronze plates to roll and cut their pasta on, giving it an imperfect texture that allows sauce to stick more readily. In a , Pashman documented the birth of his scientifically and culturally-informed attempt at the perfect pasta. Called Cascatelli, which translates to something like ‘Little Pasta Waterfalls’, they combine Pashman’s favorite aspects of various different pasta forms. Ruffled edges create a “sauce trough” into which sauce can accumulate, while the use of Sfoglini’s bronze plates give cascatelli that special rustic texture. Forkability, or the ease at which someone can press a fork and lift a pasta without it falling apart, is high, as there are overlapping elements that created more area for deeper penetration. Lastly, tooth-sinkability has been enhanced by right angles on the formations both above and below the noodle, giving it that lovely nature which Italians need in their pasta. Altogether, cascatelli gave Pashman his perfect dream pasta, it gave the Sfoglini company a new hit to sell—but they’re so popular they are already backed up by 6-8 weeks, but .

"A study led by UT Southwestern dermatologists suggests that a common inflammatory skin condition may stem from poorly regulated hormones. The finding could offer an unexpected new target to fight this condition. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a form of eczema. AD affects up to 13% of children and 10% of adults, with an annual treatment cost of $5.3 billion in the U.S. alone. “We often think of eczema as a dry-skin condition and treat mild cases with moisturizers,” said corresponding author Tamia Harris-Tryon at UTSW. “Here, we’re showing that a gene that’s important for making hormones seems to play a role in the skin making its own moisturizers. “If we could alter this gene’s activity, we could potentially provide relief to eczema patients by helping the skin make more oils and lipids to moisturize itself.” Dr. Harris-Tryon explained that previous research has linked AD to overactivity in genes responsible for the production of two inflammatory immune molecules, interleukins 4 and 13 (IL-4 and IL-13). A relatively new drug called dupilumab—a monoclonal antibody that reduces the amount of the inflammatory molecules—has been extremely effective in many patients with moderate to severe AD. However, the molecular mechanisms behind how IL-4 and IL-13 contribute to this form of eczema was unknown. To investigate this question, Dr. Harris-Tryon and her colleagues focused on sebocytes, the cells that make up sebaceous glands. These glands produce an oily, waxy barrier that coats the skin, helping it retain moisture. The researchers dosed human sebocytes growing in petri dishes with IL-4 and IL-13, then used a technique called RNA sequencing to get a readout on gene activity for the entire genome and compared it with gene activity in sebocytes that weren’t treated with these immune molecules. They found that a gene called , which makes an enzyme called 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1, became up to 60 times more active when exposed to the two interleukins. The finding was a surprise, Dr. Harris-Tryon said, because this enzyme is well known for playing a key role in the production of hormones such as testosterone and progesterone, but it had never been linked to atopic dermatitis and skin lipid production. Databases of human gene activity showed that tends to be overactive in patients with eczema; a single study of patients on dupilumab showed that this drug appears to lower ‘s activity. Both pieces of evidence suggest that IL-4 and IL-13 drive up the activity of this gene. To determine how this gene affects sebum output, the researchers manipulated ‘s activity in sebocytes growing in petri dishes. They found that when they made this gene less active, the levels of hormones decreased, and skin sebum production increased. The reverse was also true, with more gene activity leading to higher amounts of hormones and less sebum. The researchers made similar findings in a mouse model of AD, with hormone production decreasing the production of skin lipids. Together, Dr. Harris-Tryon said, these findings—published in , suggest that could be a new target for fighting AD and potentially other forms of eczema. “Changing the output of this gene could eventually offer a way to treat AD that’s completely different from any treatment that currently exists,” she added. That’s an exciting breakthrough indeed.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/new-treatment-for-eczema-could-emerge-after-possible-cause-was-identified-by-surprised-scientists/

"In the Netherlands, a country famous for all manner of methods for surmounting aquatic obstacles, an engineering company recently completed the world’s largest 3D-printed bridge. Built in Nijmegen, the bridge spans 95 feet (29 meters) across a canal, and was completed through a collaboration from the Eindhoven Institute of Technology, a pair of engineering firms, and planning aid from the government. It surpasses by 10 feet the previous record-holding 3D-printed bridge in China, and helps demonstrate the scope of 3D printing advantages for both designers and policy makers. Among these are the facts that 3D printers use far less material than traditional construction techniques, and offer greater creative possibilities for designers. “The city of Nijmegen is very honored to receive this innovative 3D printed bridge,” said Alderman Bert Velthuis of Nijmegen City Council. “We are a city of bridges, and this special, innovative bridge is a wonderful addition. The bridge leads to connection: in the design and construction phase it connected the different partners, and from now on the bridge connects our residents.” The bridge is striking to look at, with sculpted conical feet that gives it a shape a little like that of a caterpillar. The CEO of the 3D-printing firm Weber Benelux the bridge, that was designed on a computer and printed piece by piece before being assembled on site, required 50% less material to create as the printer only deposits concrete where it’s absolutely needed for structural integrity. Furthermore, the mold and design will be there in the Weber Benelux Nijmegen site for years to come, meaning the bridge can be quickly commissioned and printed again with only minor tweaks, a reproducibility rare in large civic projects, and which could save tens of thousands in design, surveying, and consulting costs. “Nijmegen has had a fantastic year as [it was named] European Green Capital,” said Alderman of the municipality of Nijmegen Harriët Tiemens, in on the bridge’s announcement. “A new innovative sustainable 3D-printed bridge is a nice addition to this.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/worlds-longest-3d-printed-bridge-in-nijmegen-netherlands/
"Rivian Automobiles has just launched a pair of all-electric outdoor adventure vehicles following years of subjecting them to the harshest testing and explorers’ feedback. On September 14th, their first models were driven off the assembly line in their Illinois production plant. The R1T and the R1S are super-loaded with features specialized for road-tripping to off-road adventure, and they have a range 80 miles greater than Ford’s electric pickup. “A trail to the middle of nowhere. A great mountain road. A long weekend with the family. We are focused on building products that inspire and enable you to see the world, on-road and way off,” the website reads, and that’s no understatement. The robustness and capability of these vehicles is dramatic, as were the rigors Rivian put their SUV and pickup through on the way to the dealership. The battery system was built and tested in environments as varied as 130ºF to -25ºF to ensure the car starts no matter where you left it. The four-wheel drive system will do 0-60 in 3 seconds, can crawl up rocks at inclines as steep as you care to attempt, and the models can wade through three feet of water. To get some early durability testing, on a 13,000-mile trip from the tip of Argentina up to Los Angeles, which spanned 100 days and every type of terrain and weather imaginable. With a price tag starting at $67,500 the vehicles are not exactly cheap, but for the most capable nature-lover who is interested in enjoying the great outdoors as much as they are in saving it, there’s just no other choice out there. After months of building pre-production vehicles, this morning our first customer vehicle drove off our production line in Normal!  Our team's collective efforts have made this moment possible. Can't wait to get these into the hands of our customers! Automatic driving, LTE-WiFI, a booming stereo system with full tablet connectibility and 120V power outlets turns any trip a little more like an RV-one rather than an on-the-rough camping expedition. The lack of engine block gives the R1T an extraordinary amount of storage space—68 cubic feet in total, which also allows the them to fit a full-size spare tire as standard, and the innovative “Gear Tunnel.” Located between the cab and the backseat, the gear tunnel is a third standard storage option idea for skis, wetsuits, muddy or dirty cloths and equipment, or anything else that doesn’t have a home, as well as being the compartment for some unique add-ons. Rivian will sell you an electric slide-out camp kitchen—complete with crockery that folds in and out of the Gear Tunnel. On top of the all-glass panoramic star-gazing roof is an equipment rack fitted with attachments suitable for most third-party products. It’s an awful lot to fit into a car, but this month the company announced it had received for the R1T, which they say will be available with an extended range of 400 miles on a charge by next year.

"A real-life Soprano went from New Jersey gang member to musical star after videos of him singing to patients at the hospital where he worked went viral. 28-year-old Enrique Rodriquez from Central Jersey, now works as a phlebotomist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and is widely renowned for his musical talent. He began posting videos on his TikTok account, which now boasts over 80,000 followers, of him singing and playing the piano for critically ill patients in the hospital’s Intensive Care Unit. He left behind a history of violence and crime to help people who are suffering after turning to religion. He said of his turnaround: “I found God at an extremely troubling period in my life and he showed himself to me when I needed him most. I know that God wanted me to care for people just as he cared for me, and the hospital was the perfect place to do that.” It was 2009 when Rodriguez first got involved with gangs after his eldest brother went to prison. The loss of his brother to the jail system meant that Rodriquez felt disconnected from his loved ones, and he went out searching for what he called “the wrong kind of family.” He became a ‘blood member’ of a local gang for three years after being misled by the idea of joining a strong brotherhood and making quick and easy money. He explained: “The gang lifestyle is pure manipulation. They make you feel like they care about you, that they’ve got your back that you’re family; but all they do is use you so they don’t have to get their hands dirty.” The turning point for Rodriguez came when he hurt the “wrong person” and a rival gang came after his mother. There were two attempts made on his mother’s life before the aggressors were arrested, and Rodriguez believes it is down to God that his mother is still alive today. He added: “I have done a lot of bad things and mixed with a lot of bad people. “I’m just grateful God looked out for me and my family. He has given me the opportunity to start a new life, and music is a huge part of that.” Rodriguez began working in the hospital in 2012 as a housekeeper in order to get a job there as quickly as possible. A year later, he completed training to become a patient carer in the ICU, and now works as a phlebotomist ferrying COVID-19 and blood samples from different laboratories. He has worked at the hospital for nine years now, and during his career, he discovered that he possessed a raw musical talent. Unable to read sheet music, Rodriguez taught himself to play both the piano and the guitar, and practiced by playing in front of several patients on the ward. Sadly, Barbara Freud, a cancer patient who was one of Rodriguez’s first listeners, passed away whilst he was on holiday, but he will always remember the musical bond they shared. He now makes regular visits to patients’ bedsides and uses TikTok to live stream his performances to tens of thousands of viewers. Rodriquez plans to grow his following by making more videos and spreading love and happiness through his music. He said: “I love what I do and I believe my purpose in this world is to help other people. “When I’m singing to these patients I can feel the connection we have and it’s wonderful. “There was a time where I was singing to a patient in a coma and he woke up for the first time in weeks. “It was a true miracle.” Next week, Rodriguez will travel to Puerto Rico with his church group to give aid to disadvantaged children, and there’s no doubt his guitar will be making the trip too.

"A smooth pebble, fired in a kiln from the ashes of a dearly departed, is the latest way Americans can choose to carry on the memory of a loved one. is a startup looking to give people both a personal and portable way to remember someone they’ve lost, with one person’s ashes capable of producing a collection of stones. As has reported before, Americans as a whole don’t have the best relationship with death. While the cost of traditional casket burial funerals is reaching unsustainable levels, a sea of new companies are rushing in to help people find better, cheaper solutions. Some have leaned towards the green funeral movement, with , or forest conservation at the base of a tree. Others have moved into personalized ash-crafting, such , , or even an artificial diamond. Parting Stone is a mixture of the two, sparing soils from the near-ammonia levels of pH found in human ashes, while also allowing people to quite discretely carry a small memory of the departed with them. “It’s a canvas for the experience, not the experience itself,” explains founder Justin Crowe to The ashes are milled into a really fine powder and mixed with water to create a clay-like base. This is placed into a kiln and fired into the stone which is then polished. Without knowing exactly why, the stones tend to vary in color, which Crowe hypothesizes could be due to physiological differences between the deceased, such as diet composition or medications. Regardless, they can appear white, brown, faintly blueish-grey or green, lavender, or with a variety of speckled patterns. Weighing between 4-8 pounds, a family will typically get anywhere from 40-60 stones at the cost of $675 for a human and $300 for a pet. Crowe explains that he came up with the idea after losing his grandfather in 2014, and wanted a better experience with his remains, which felt void of spirit, even in a decorative urn. Of course, as Crowe points out, ashes usually come in a plastic bag before an urn is chosen. “We don’t accept this experience in any other part of modern life. Why are we accepting it for people we love?” he said. He remembers how people felt around the stones at a business conference, when more than 200 people asked to hold them. Collecting small, beautiful or fascinating stones is something many of us do, especially in natural places like a waterfall or in a desert wash where interesting geological processes occur. Holding a smooth stone that fits nicely in one’s palm, knowing it contains a piece of something you love, speaks to that very primal desire.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/parting-stone-turns-ashes-into-a-collection-of-small-memorial-stones/
"There’s plenty a humorous tale to prove the adage “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure,” but when one Ohio family accidentally threw their grandma’s treasure into the trash, it was no laughing matter. Unbeknownst to her relatives, the canny granny had stashed $25,000 in cold hard cash in her freezer. While tidying up the kitchen, her erstwhile kinfolk accidentally tossed out the tidy sum along with the outdated frozen veggies. It was only after the fact that the elderly woman remembered to warn her family not to misplace the envelope with the money in it, but by then, it was too late. The garbage had already been collected and her nest egg was on its way to the city landfill. Frantic, the family reached out to Republic Solid Waste Services to see if there was any way their grandma’s missing savings could be retrieved. It would all depend, they learned, on whether or not the truck had already arrived at the landfill. Had the truck offloaded at the dumpsite, it would have been a lost cause. “The bulldozers… immediately start smoothing it out, pushing it into the hill, dropping dirt on it and start covering up the process of the landfill,” Republic operations supervisor Gary Capan told Cleveland’s . “…We do that in a nonstop process [so] if it got dropped there, there’s no finding it anymore.” Luckily, Capan was able to track down the driver who had yet to make the drop-off. The truck was diverted to a nearby recycling center where its six-ton cargo of garbage was disgorged on the tarmac, and a crew of 10 stalwart workers immediately began sifting through the mountain of refuse in search of the buried booty. And find it they did—in record time. “[I] couldn’t believe it took 10 minutes and actually, I said, ‘Man, it looks just like that,’ pulled it off, opened it up and there was the package inside with the money. They (the family) were so happy, they were tearing up,” Dan Schoewe, operations manager at the recycling center told News-5. “It’s rare that we can find something for somebody, so this is like the biggest one I’ve seen in 30 years.” While we’re glad this story has a happy ending, a word of warning to the well-meaning de-clutters of the world: elderly people of squirreling money and other valuables away in the oddest places, so if helping clear out a loved one’s residence is on your to-do list, be sure to proceed with caution. Since “greens” from the U.S. Mint generally have no expiration date, it would be a sin to throw them out.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/ohio-republic-services-25k-lost-and-found-trash-can/
"Black cats may have the reputation for being bad luck, but don’t tell that to the owner of one ebony feline who helped save her life. Piran the kitty lives with his cat mom in a rural area of Cornwall, England. When the 83-year-old Bodmin woman went missing, neighbors launched a search party, scouring the nearby countryside, but she was nowhere to be found—until searchers caught sight of an agitated Piran, mewing loudly by a cornfield gate. “The cat is very attached to her, and he was going back and forth in the gateway and meowing, so I decided to go and search the maize field,” searcher Tamar Longmuir told . With the crop standing seven feet tall, the going was difficult. Keeping to the perimeter, Longmuir skirted the field, calling out her neighbor’s name. She’d reached the bottom of the field when she finally heard a faint response. To Longmuir’s dismay, she realized the elderly woman had taken a tumble down a steep, 70-foot ravine, and after passing through some barbed wire, had finally come to rest in a stream. Although Longmuir was able to make her way down to assess the situation, and thankfully, learned her neighbor lady had sustained no major injuries, it’s believed the octogenarian had been stuck there for several hours. This afternoon Officers from Bodmin were tasked to conduct a search for a missing 83 year old female. The female was located by a member of the public who had spotted the female’s cat, meowing in the corner of a large maize field near to her home address. 1/3 Longmuir had to climb back up the ravine to get cell phone service, but she was able to contact emergency crews who soon arrived to extricate the stranded senior from the ravine. After a concerted two-hour effort by almost 25 emergency personnel from the police, fire department, and air and water rescue services, the woman was airlifted to a nearby hospital for treatment. “Whilst the lady concerned is still currently receiving care, she is in good spirits and is being well looked after,” Bodmin Police said in a . “Piran the cat saved the day!” Indeed, had Piran not sounded the alarm, the outcome might have been vastly different. “Without the cat waiting at the gate to that field, it could have been hours later that I or anyone else would have checked in there,” Longmuir told Sky News. Grateful for Piran’s persistent vocal intervention in aid of his human, neighbors are pitching in to take care of her kitty while she recuperates. In America, August 17th marks National Black Cat Appreciation Day, but considering Piran’s recent heroic deeds, we think an international show of appreciation for a tale that begins and ends with the cat’s meow would be just about “ fect.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cats-meows-lead-searcher-to-83-year-old-owner-who-fell-into-ravine/
"While youth is often a time of great promise and achievement, a life well lived can also be filled with any number of next chapters and second—or even third—acts that add depth, nuance, and meaning to our stories. At 65 years old, Somerset native Carole-Ann Warburton experienced a plot twist that led to the fulfillment of a long-cherished dream she’d never even spoken of aloud. After a debilitating illness incapacitated her, Warburton was left with the question of what to do going forward. During her convalescence, her daughter brought around some real estate listings for the sort of homes in which she thought her mum might best spend her golden years. Coincidentally, amongst the notices was an offering for a small barbershop with an above-stairs apartment. For Warburton, although she admits “the place was awful,” it was love at first sight—and the perfect opportunity to do something she’d yearned to do for almost as long as she could remember—work in a bookshop. Less than three months after coming to her decision, Warburton had handed in her retirement notice, sold her house, bought the store, and—using a personal inventory totaling between 8,000 to 9,000 titles—she launched her new venture, . Warburton has been an avid book collector since she was a child. As an adult, she married a man with a similar avocation. The four-bedroom home she and her ex-husband shared with their children (much to their dismay) was “chock-a-block” with books. Warburton admits learning to let go of her beloved tomes was a bit of an adjustment, but one she feels the better for making. “It still feels, when a special book goes out, like a bit of a loss—as if some little part of me has been taken away,” she said in an interview with . “And then I make common sense come back to me and say, ‘Let someone else learn from it.’ It’s a growing up, if you like, an acceptance.” A decade on, The Book Rest recently celebrated its 10th anniversary. Although the pandemic has slowed foot traffic, since Warburton’s driving motive isn’t monetary profit, but rather, something of a deeper, more idiosyncratic personal value, she has no plans to close up shop. Having achieved her own dream, Warburton sees every day in the bookstore as an opportunity to help others realize theirs as well. “All the dreams are in the books,” she told The Guardian. “They are all there waiting to be picked up… Someone can walk in tomorrow and say, ‘I have been looking for that for an awfully long time!” And as gatekeeper to her own small universe of literary wonders, Warburton says she plans to stay around as long as she can to ensure that they do.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/carole-ann-warburton-bookstore-open/
"An international research team has retraced the astonishing lifetime journey of an Arctic woolly mammoth, which covered enough of the Alaska landscape during its 28 years to almost circle the Earth twice. Scientists gathered unprecedented details of its life through analysis of a 17,000-year-old fossil from the University of Alaska Museum of the North. By generating and studying isotopic data in the mammoth’s tusk, they were able to match its movements and diet with isotopic maps of the region. Few details have been known about the lives and movements of woolly mammoths, and the study offers the first evidence that they traveled vast distances. An outline of the mammoth’s life is detailed in the new issue of the journal Science. “It’s not clear-cut if it was a seasonal migrator, but it covered some serious ground,” said University of Alaska Fairbanks researcher Matthew Wooller, senior and co-lead author of the paper. “It visited many parts of Alaska at some point during its lifetime, which is pretty amazing when you think about how big that area is.” Researchers at the Alaska Stable Isotope Facility, where Wooller is director, split the 6-foot tusk lengthwise and generated about 400,000 microscopic data points using a laser and other techniques. The detailed isotope analyses they made are possible because of the way that mammoth tusks grew. Mammoths steadily added new layers on a daily basis throughout their lives. When the tusk was split lengthwise for sampling, these growth bands looked like stacked ice cream cones, offering a chronological record of an entire mammoth’s life. “From the moment they’re born until the day they die, they’ve got a diary and it’s written in their tusks,” said Pat Druckenmiller, a paleontologist and director of the UA Museum of the North, . “Mother Nature doesn’t usually offer up such convenient and lifelong records of an individual’s life.” Scientists knew that the mammoth died on Alaska’s North Slope above the Arctic Circle, where its remains were excavated by a team that included UAF’s Dan Mann and Pam Groves, who are among the co-authors of the study. Researchers pieced together the mammoth’s journey up to that point by analyzing isotopic signatures in its tusk from the elements strontium and oxygen, which were matched with maps predicting isotope variations across Alaska. Researchers created the maps by analyzing the teeth of hundreds of small rodents from across Alaska held in the museum’s collections. The animals travel relatively small distances during their lifetimes and represent local isotope signals. Using that local dataset, they mapped isotope variation across Alaska, providing a baseline to trace the mammoth movements. After taking geographic barriers into account and the average distance it traveled each week, researchers used a novel spatial modeling approach to chart the likely routes the animal took during its life. Ancient DNA preserved in the mammoth’s remains allowed the team to identify it as a male that was related to the last group of its species living in mainland Alaska. Those details provided more insight into the animal’s life and behavior, said Beth Shapiro, who led the DNA component of the study. For example, an abrupt shift in its isotopic signature, ecology and movement at about age 15 probably coincided with the mammoth being kicked out of its herd, mirroring a pattern seen in some modern-day male elephants. “Knowing that he was male provided a better biological context in which we could interpret the isotopic data,” said Shapiro, a professor at the University of California Santa Cruz and investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Isotopes also offered a clue about what led to the animal’s demise. Nitrogen isotopes spiked during the final winter of its life, a signal that can be a hallmark of starvation in mammals. “It’s just amazing what we were able to see and do with this data,” said co-lead author Clement Bataille, a researcher from the University of Ottawa who led the modeling effort in collaboration with Amy Willis at the University of Washington. Discovering more about the lives of extinct species satisfies more than curiosity, said Wooller, a professor in the UAF Institute of Northern Engineering and College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences. Those details could be surprisingly relevant today as many species adapt their movement patterns and ranges with the shifting climate. “The Arctic is seeing a lot of changes now, and we can use the past to see how the future may play out for species today and in the future,” Wooller said. “Trying to solve this detective story is an example of how our planet and ecosystems react in the face of environmental change.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/travels-of-mammoth-17000-years-ago-revealed-tusks-alaska/
"In dramatic digital turn of events, a hacker with a heart of gold who exploited a flaw to steal $600 million worth of cryptocurrency from a trading site has been offered a job as Chief Security Advisor to the very company he robbed.

"Big tropical mining companies could soon be presented with a green alternative to traditional strip mining by letting plants hoover up the trace minerals instead of mining equipment. Phytomining, as it’s called, relies on a select few species of plants that can literally suck the soil dry of minerals like zinc, selenium, nickel, and cobalt. Rather than polluted rivers, plumes of sulfur dioxide, and the throng of heavy machinery, phytominin—as one demo site which started in 2015 bears witness—relies on locals to trim a few feet of a 20-feet tall green shrub. These leavings are collected and burned to create “bio-ore” filled with 20 to 25% nickel by weight. The mining industry is keen to see how this green alternative to one of the most carbon-heavy industries can actually perform. Allowing plants to gather materials for you beats rooting around for it in the ground on a remote island like Borneo. “We can now demonstrate that metal farms can produce between 150 to 250 kilograms of nickel per hectare (170 to 280 pounds per acre), annually,” Antony van der Ent, a senior research fellow at Australia’s University of Queensland, told in a special report on phytomining in Indonesia. “At this stage, phytomining can go full-scale for nickel immediately, while phytomining for cobalt, thallium, and selenium is within reach,” van der Ent said. Nickel mining companies might be drooling over the van der Ent and other “metal farmer” experts have done that found nickel phytomining to be on a similar cost basis to corn farming, but with an after-production gross of around $1,800 per hectare—making it a very profitable activity. While the report details phytomining in Borneo, trials in the U.S.A, Italy, Albania, Canada, France, Spain, and New Zealand. There are around 700 recognized “hyperaccumulators,” which is the term for plant species that can absorb large quantities of these minerals before depositing them in their shoots, branches, and leaves. There are some parallels to food agriculture, for example the amendment of calcium is vital, while nitrogen and organic material supplementation seem to increase the available nickel in plant shoots. By far the most advantageous aspect of phytomining if you run a major mining corporation is actually not where the soil is rich, but where the soil is poor, in nickel. At concentrations of 1% or less, the only option is to strip mine, for example in locations like Brazil, Cuba, Indonesia, the Philippines, and New Caledonia. It involves taking a surface layer of rock and soil off a stretch of ground, and using acid-leaching heavy machinery to extract the scarce nickel particles. All this unhappy work for very little metal results in a layer of toxic topsoil filled with trailing metal particles that has to be collected and sold to landfills at great cost to the miners. With production in the Indonesian site slowed due to COVID, van der Ent is using this time to develop a hydro-metallurgical extraction method so as to avoid burning the plant trimmings for nickel, thus eliminating the CO2 generated. That’s exciting news indeed.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/phytomining-is-like-metal-farming-nickel-zinc-and-cobalt-using-plants/
"When Paolo Fanciulli dropped 39 large marble sculptures down to the bottom of the sea off Tuscany’s Maremma Regional Park, it was not his first strike in the battle against unsustainable fishing, but it was his first step into the art world. This fascinating story, at the heart of which is a fascinating and charismatic figure, recounts the confluence of an ancient relationship between man and nature and a celebration of the Mediterranean Sea as a cradle of civilization. 60-year-old Fanciulli practices sustainable fishing and “ ” or fishing-tourism at his home in the village of Talamone. He still wakes up at dawn before heading out into the clear waters off the coast of Tuscany’s Grosseto province. He and his colleague Francesco fish, as their ancient ancestors did, by casting shallow nets that take mullet and bream while leaving the bottom reaches undisturbed. Fanciulli’s “war” against illegal or unsustainable methods of fishing is long documented, and has appeared in newspapers around the globe. From 2002 to 2006, he gathered the help of the Tuscan government and WWF-Italia to deploy a strategic formation of 126 underwater cement bollards to ruin any of the deep sea trawling nets which he realized were rapidly destroying the fish stocks he grew up harvesting. The nets would tear up the delicate seabed ecosystem, including seagrass meadows, and simply decapitate the marine food-web. But Fanciulli knew the nets were extremely expensive to replace, and the relatively-inexpensive bollards, costing about €560 to make and transport, would last a lot longer than the poachers would. That work took him twenty years to complete, recount the authors of his biography His next project would be similar, but quite different. It would expand the protection of his beloved Mediterranean, while enlisting some of the greatest marble sculptors on Earth to bring the world’s attention to the greater problem of general environmental degradation. “The importance of the project is that we need some sensible consumption of resources,” Fanciulli told GNN However the illegal industry is devastating everything, and with this project we can send a message to the whole world to give back; not only to take.” “But the intent of mine is also to think of the future; a better future, with more sustainable fishing, and a greater respect for the environment.” Paolo Fanciulli is, as he told me when I went out on a tour with him and Francesco, a fisherman, not a super-savvy marketer or social media manager. So with the help of a childhood friend who had become a successful engineer, Fanciulli imagined a series of large marble sculptures, taken from the Carrara Quarry, the fount of so much of the marble which Michelangelo used to create his artworks. Even while Fanciulli asked for merely two, after meeting with the President of Grosseto region and Ippolito Turco, the president of an association that now looks after the sculptures—he received 100. But who would sculpt them? He needed to find generous and far-sighted sculptors who would put their creativity at the service of the sea, and enough funding to transport the 10-20 ton blocks from the north of Tuscany to the south. Arriving at the house of an artist named Massimo Catalani, who lived in Rome and worked at the famous Federici Palace, Paolo, who brought his morning’s catch in a large pot to cook for dinner, was connected with scores of people from the world of art and architecture, one of whom was Emily Young, considered Britain’s best living sculptor. “It was like a film,” Paolo writes. Young was among a dozen international and Italian sculptors who donated their time and effort to that would not be seen in traditional museums, but that would slowly become covered in seaweed, and seen only by divers as they sit sentinel-like, defending the life of the depths. In May 2015, the first 20 stone blocks, each costing thousands simply to transport to the pier of Talamone, were loaded onto a barge and floated out to their final resting place. A second group of 19 were lowered down last summer. Ippolito Turco told “We’ve managed to totally stop the illegal fishing in the area. Now we’re looking at extending the project along the coast to the north. We want to put more sculptures on the seafloor. It has proved to be very effective.” “What you want to happen is that in time, you won’t know they are sculptures,” said Ms. Young. “They will be so covered in seaweed and algae that they will look like a coral reef or the remains of a wreck.” Young added that she likes to hope they will be found by marine archaeologists one day, and hypothesized as being part of an ancient civilization. 61 blocks of greyish marble remain in Turco and Fanciulli’s possession, waiting for world-renowned sculptors to carve them into statues. For those familiar with the 17 or guilds of Siena, one sculptor plans to make one of every animal-symbol on the guilds’ coats of arms, something bound to attract major investment from the uber-patriotic city, while Paolo also wants to work with the Grosseto Cultural Office to install underwater lighting amid the sculptures to light them up for a few hours at night time. “If there are artists that want to come to the House of the Fish, we are available, because the more artists we have the stronger the project,” Fanciulli told GNN “I think if famous artists come here, there’s a bigger impact. If there are artists reading this, our sea has need of your talents.” The is one big fundraiser, where people can contribute in all sorts of ways to the project. Artists looking to carve a block will post their idea as a fundraiser, and anyone who contributes gets gifts in return, such as dinner and a fishing trip with Paolo, paintings, and more.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/paolo-fanciullis-la-casa-dei-pesci-is-an-underwater-sculpture-garden-that-stops-trawling/

"Locally extinct bandicoots have returned to an Australian national park in New South Wales after more than 100 years. The nationally threatened species—known by local Aboriginal people as ‘talpero’—once ranged across inland Australia, including the area now managed as Sturt National Park. The small, native marsupials became extinct in the region after ecosystem changes caused by rabbits and predation by feral cats and foxes. Now, a founding population of talpero have been reintroduced to the area by the team at Wild Deserts. Their reintroduction is another major milestone in the Wild Deserts conservation project, which last year reintroduced bilbies and mulgaras into the national park. “The season has been tremendous out here with the rains we had last year and then again in March,” says UNSW’s Dr Rebecca West, an ecologist based at Wild Deserts. “These rains have helped create a highly productive system that is excellent for the reintroduction of this species.” Up until recently, western barred bandicoots were considered one species with five subspecies, but this has recently split into five species. Only the Shark Bay species, the species translocated to Sturt National Park, survived. UNSW scientists acknowledge this important taxonomic work. This remaining species has been moved to two islands and three fenced locations. The Wild Deserts conservation reintroduction came from one of these, a self-sustaining population at Arid Recovery near Roxby Downs. Supported by governments because of their conservation value, the Wild Deserts conservation reintroduction recognizes the important role that this species complex played in ecological function, important for restoring desert ecosystems. The Wild Deserts team eradicated every last rabbit, cat, and fox from two 2,000 hectare feral-proof fenced exclosures within Sturt National Park, creating one of the largest feral-animal-free areas in Australia. These exclosures in the wild work as ‘training zones’, where reintroduced vulnerable species can learn to live in the wild without dangers from predators like cats and foxes. When their populations start thriving, the animals will be released into a second training area with predators, where they will learn to become predator-smart. The ultimate project aim is to release a smarter generation of bandicoots and other locally extinct mammals back into the wild. NSW Environment Minister Matt Kean says: “The reintroduction of this important species to the Corner Country in Sturt National Park is another huge step in our battle to halt and reverse the tide of mammal extinctions. “Our aim is to re-establish ecosystems as they were before feral cats, foxes and rabbits wreaked havoc on Australian native wildlife.” Talpero are the smallest members of the bandicoot family, roughly the size of a guinea pig. They can be distinguished from other bandicoots by their fawn-coloured coat with pale stripes across their rump. The nocturnal marsupials dig for their food in sandy environments, making foraging pits to find seeds, tubers, insects, and fungi. This process turns the soil and helps it catch water and nutrients, contributing to the overall health of the ecosystem. The Wild Deserts team have introduced 10 talpero as a founding population, but they hope to add more members soon. “If they keep doing as well as they are, then I think we will be able to add some more characters to the mix,” says Dr West. “Hopefully that will re-establish bandicoots back into Sturt National Park into the future.” The founding talpero population are from Arid Recovery, an independent not-for-profit conservation and research project that manages a large feral-free safe haven near Roxby Downs in South Australia. The marsupials were released into Wild Deserts’ southern exclosure, called ‘Mingku’—named after the word meaning happy in the Maljangapa language. The talpero joined two other recently reintroduced species, the bilbies and mulgaras. “This is an important step in restoring this desert ecosystem,” says Professor Richard Kingsford, leader of the Wild Deserts project and director of the UNSW Centre for Ecosystem Science. “We are already starting to see the beginnings of a transformation occurring in the landscape. The soil is starting to turn over, which gives great opportunities for lots of little invertebrates and catches water and nutrients. “We think that’s part of how we can transform these deserts back into what they were.” Dr John Read from Ecological Horizons, a major partner of the Wild Deserts project, says “These energetic little diggers at Wild Deserts are important culturally, historically and ecologically and will be great for restoring the desert.” The Wild Deserts scientists will check in on the animals daily using radio tracking devices to ensure they’re adapting well to their new environment. “We have deliberately designed the Wild Deserts project to allow us opportunities for scientific monitoring to assess our management and the success of the species,” says UNSW’s Dr Reece Pedler, the Wild Deserts project coordinator, . “We hope to establish talpero in other parts of the Wild Deserts site—and ultimately into neighbouring areas of Sturt National Park or beyond. We have already recorded recruitment of young that were translocated in pouch and other young that were born at Wild Deserts.” Wild Deserts is part of a major NSW Government initiative to protect threatened native mammals via the Reintroduction of Locally Extinct Mammals project and the Saving our Species initiative. Next, the team plan to reintroduce other threatened mammals into the Wild Deserts exclosures, including western quolls, stick-nest rats, and golden bandicoots.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bandicoots-return-to-sturt-national-park-after-century/
"A mom’s photo was amusingly photobombed by a bemused stingray—pulling the exact same face as her baby daughter. 41-year-old Wendy Armstrong regularly takes her young daughters, two-year-old Aurora and six-month-old Daisy, for a day out to the Lake District Coast Aquarium in England. During one visit, Wendy noticed a stingray was taking a particular interest in Daisy… and that both were pulling the same forlorn facial expression. Nurse Wendy and her power plant worker husband, Mike Armstrong, said Daisy has been a very serious baby. The mom-of-two from Workington in Cumbria said, “It is definitely up there as one of our favourite pictures that we have of our kids. “I had my phone out, and when I saw they were both pulling the same miserable facial expression I burst out laughing and took a photo. Thankfully Daisy is much happier now!” Thanks for bringing a big smile to so many faces, Daisy.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/daisy-lake-district-aquarium-grumpy-stingray-photo/
"A pair of golfing pals were astonished when they both got a hole in one in succession, breaking 17 million to one odds. 48-year-old David Giles was playing in a duo against two colleagues when he scored a hole in one on the seventh tee. After an excited celebration, the group of businessmen couldn’t believe it when his team mate, 51-year-old Chris Bunce, took the next shot and scored a hole in one using the same club. David said, “I was over the moon with my hole in one and once we had calmed down, who would have ever thought another was about to follow! “We had two witnesses who were playing with us and we were all just left speechless. There was plenty of laughing, swearing, and high fives all round. What a game!” It was the first ever hole in one for David’s manager Chris, from Southend, Essex, who has only been playing golf for a year. The super shot at The Oaks Golf Club in York was David’s second ever hole in one. The pair each scored a hole in one after hitting the ball 146 yards from the tee on the seventh hole. David’s co-worker Garry Marsh, who had been playing with the two men, added: “I’d never seen a hole in one in the flesh, so to speak, so to see two on the same hole on the same round was absolutely fantastic.” “I also enjoyed the pint I was bought afterwards too!”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/hole-in-one-twice-york-david-giles-chris-bunce/
"A New Yorker has launched a hugely successful GoFundMe campaign to fly at-risk Afghans out of the country as quickly as possible. Internet meme artist Quentin Quarantino’s raised $550,000 in just two hours. Now, after only a day, the total has rocketed toward $6 million and is still climbing. After two decades of U.S. military intervention and their recent withdrawl, the Taliban extremist group has returned to power and specifically targeted certain individuals and their families. The GoFundMe campaign hopes to help these human rights lawyers, activists, translators, journalists, and artists—all of whom are “at imminent risk” of being killed. The asylum seekers will be transported in family groups, and the funds raised so far should translate into the evacuation of thousands of refugees. If you do the math, Quarantino says that every $550,000 will buy two airplanes out of Kabul. Per the GoFundMe page, “Every $1,500 raised represents a seat on one of the planes, and a life saved.” : Tommy Marcus, known by his pandemic pen name, Quentin Quarantino, is a University of Michigan grad who donned the alter ego in the early days of COVID-19 as a humorous way to cope with the stresses of life in lockdown. Initially, posting funny memes, the musings morphed into serious social commentary. “The internet can be a force for good,” Quarantino stated on his , which currently has over 767,000 followers. “Raising five million dollars in less than 24 hours for this rescue mission has given us, and so many around the world, hope for humanity. Most importantly, it’s a direct line to attempt safe passage for Afghans in danger.” The stunning total of funds so quickly raised is a testament to the human spirit that Quarantino finds humbling. “The amount of impact this is going to have and the lives it will save is so mesmerizing that no words I can put in this tweet will do it justice,” he posted.

"A five-minute breathing exercise that you can do while watching television can lower your blood pressure as much as medication, according to a new small study. Described as “strength training for your breathing muscles”, it uses a hand-held medical device that provides resistance as a person inhales through a tube. Scientists say it can lower cardiovascular disease risk in aging adults—and could also aid athletes in running faster marathons. High-Resistance Inspiratory Muscle Strength Training (IMST) is meant to be done in reps like high-intensity interval training, with quicker, higher resistance breaths leading to “cardiovascular, cognitive, and sports performance improvements.” The technique could be even more effective at lowering blood pressure than going for a run, especially in postmenopausal women. Professor Doug Seals at the University of Colorado Boulder hailed it as an easy and drug-free option. Developed in the 1980s for respiratory disease to help patients strengthen their diaphragm and other breathing muscles, the regimen was prescribed for 30-minute-per-day at low resistance. But inspired by HIIT, researchers now believe 30 inhalations a day at high resistance, six days per week, could reap many benefits. : The study, the Journal of the American Heart Association, recruited 36 healthy adults aged 50 to 79 with above-normal blood pressure with half doing high resistance IMST for six weeks and the others doing a placebo where the resistance was much lower. Even six weeks after they quit doing IMST, they maintained most of that improvement. The treatment group also saw a 45% improvement in vascular endothelial function, or the ability for arteries to expand upon stimulation, and a significant increase in levels of nitric oxide, a molecule key for dilating arteries and preventing plaque buildup. Nitric oxide levels naturally decline with age. The IMST group saw their systolic blood pressure dip nine points on average, a reduction generally exceeds that achieved by walking 30 minutes a day five days a week. That decline is also equal to the effects of some blood presssure-lowering drugs. “We found that not only is it more time-efficient than traditional exercise programs, but the benefits may also be longer-lasting,” said lead author Dr. Daniel Craighead, at UC Boulder. “If aerobic exercise won’t improve this key measure of cardiovascular health for postmenopausal women, they need another lifestyle intervention that will. This could be it.” : Craighead, who uses IMST for his own aerobic training, added, “It’s easy to do, it doesn’t take long, and we think it has a lot of potential to help a lot of people.” Indeed, to have a form of therapy available that lowers blood pressure without drugs, or doing aerobic exercise, which so many people tend to abhor, would be a great option. The National Institutes of Health recently awarded Seals $4 million to launch a larger follow-up study of about 100 people, comparing a 12-week IMST protocol head-to-head with aerobic exercise. Meanwhile, the a smartphone app to enable people to do the protocol at home using already commercially available devices.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/breathing-with-this-device-for-5-minutes-may-lower-blood-pressure-as-much-as-exercise-or-drugs-study/
"A Michigan woman accidentally lost her wedding rings on the sandy shores of Lake Superior—but soon celebrated the return of the precious jewels after some stunning police work by the local sheriff’s K-9 dog. Elsa Green had taken her rings off at Eagle Beach to apply some sunscreen, setting them carefully in her hat. Later, she was suddenly startled by a large bug crawling on the cap and she tossed it into the air—remembering only seconds later that her precious rings were inside. When a frantic search for the wedding band and matching engagement ring turned up nothing, Green and her friends enlisted the aid of someone using a metal detector who was scanning the sand—but he couldn’t find them, either. “I felt sick about it,” the Washington Post. “I’d been wearing those rings every day for 17 years. But at that moment, I figured they were gone.” Hoping the police might have another metal detector that would allow them to continue the search, Green’s pal drove to the Keweenaw County Sheriff’s Office. While the department didn’t have a metal detector, they did have a ‘Dogo’— a specially trained 5-year-old Dutch shepherd with a nose for ferreting out weapons. Dogo can also find things by honing in on a person’s signature odor. According to Dogo’s, handler Sgt. Brad Pelli, K-9s trained in “article search” can detect pretty much anything that still has a human scent trail on it. But, looking for a lost wedding ring would be a ‘first’. Arriving at the beach, Pelli cleared the area of people, so Dogo would have the best shot at locking onto the olfactory clue he was searching for, without distraction. It didn’t take him long. The intrepid pooch latched onto the scent of Green’s engagement ring, and dutifully sat down on the spot. Pelli sifted some sand through his hand and found its hiding place—and then found the second ring close by. With the rings back on her finger where they belonged, Green and her 9-year-old son gave Dogo a huge hug and heaped praise on Sgt. Pelli for volunteering his services without any payment. An ecstatic Green posted , celebrating the amazing find: “K9 Dogo, you will forever be my hero!” she enthused. “Dogo put his training and skills to use and sure enough he found my rings! I’ll be bringing you ice cream to say thank you!” All Dogo requires for a job well done is some praise and a chance to play with his favorite ball—but after the mini-miracle at the beach, a little treat might be a pawsome reward.

"One of the most beautiful of its species, the garter snake that inhabits the San Francisco peninsula is also the most endangered of its kind. Fortunately for the California serpent, it has human protectors who have given it a safe haven near the runways of the San Francisco International Airport. The San Francisco garter snake ( ), which can grow to three-feet in length, has skin that looks like a black canvas painted with racing stripes of bright orange and neon turquoise. As the Bay Area has grown and developed, the wetland habitat that is needed to sustain the harmless snake has diminished, so the animal was listed as endangered 54 years ago. Brutal droughts have also thinned its population, and that of their prey, as well. While the snake is mostly isolated around the San Francisco peninsula, they are thriving in numbers near the tarmac of the airport known as SFO. A tract of 160 privately-owned acres has been put to work to save the beautiful reptile, including the construction of many small ponds where the snake can keep moist, breed, and hunt for its favorite prey: the red-legged frog—which is also endangered and given sanctuary on the SFO runway lawn. : The officials who own the land and operate the airport now boast that they’ve kept 1,300 snakes happy and fed while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) looks for a better solution. In fact, the recent survey by the FWS declared this to be the largest population of this particular garter snake anywhere—something the SFO brass found to be a “pleasant surprise.” “Everything that happens there is designed to protect these species,” said SFO spokesperson Doug Yakel, . “For us, success would be that there is a stable thriving population, but to find out we had the largest population—it was really a pleasant surprise.” : In the rest of the Bay Area, cats and dogs have become two of the snake’s top predators. But, at the airport the snakes pretty much have the land to themselves—a double-positive as the airport wildlife biologist can make sure that they are insulated from the effects of climate change that would normally damage wild populations. The frogs too, have ponds they can safely raise their tadpoles in. “As our airport continues to evolve, this is the one place that continues to stay the same,” Yakel said. “We want to continue to provide a good stable environment for these two endangered species. Hearing that they are thriving—that is the ultimate validation.” : In the 1985 laid out alongside the endangered listing, the FWS wrote that 10 populations of at least 200 snakes must be stable or growing for 15 consecutive years before the snake can be considered for delisting. By this criteria, at least one habitat, SFO, has come through with spades.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/endangered-san-francisco-garter-snake-at-sfo-airport/
"Our partner Rob Brezsny provides his weekly wisdom to enlighten our thinking and motivate our mood. Rob’s , is a syndicated weekly column appearing in over a hundred publications. He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Author Katherine Mansfield once told her friend Virginia Woolf, “You put me in touch with my own soul.” I’m sorry Mansfield didn’t previously have that precious connection, but I’m elated that Woolf helped her make it. In the coming weeks, I expect you will encounter an abundance of influences like Woolf: people and animals and places and experiences that can bring you into more intimate contact with your soul. I hope you take full advantage. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): At the age of 70, Libran novelist mused, “I know now, what I didn’t then, that affection can’t always be expressed in calm, orderly, articulate ways; and that one cannot prescribe the form it should take for anyone else.” In that spirit, Libra, and in accordance with astrological omens, I authorize you to express affection in lively, unruly, demonstrative ways. Give yourself permission to be playfully imaginative, exuberantly revelatory, and vivaciously animated as you show the people and animals you cherish the nature of your feelings for them. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Do you Scorpios lie to yourselves more than the other signs lie to themselves? Are you especially prone to undermine yourselves through self-deception? I don’t think so. However, you might be among the signs most likely to mislead or beguile other people. (But here’s a caveat: On some occasions, your trickery is in a good cause, because it serves the needs of the many, not just yourself.) In any case, dear Scorpio, I will ask you to minimize all such behavior during the next five weeks. I think your success will depend on you being exceptionally honest and genuine—both to yourself and to others. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): “I like being broken,” says Sagittarius actor Jamie Campbell Bower. “It means I can have chocolate for breakfast.” I guess that when he feels down, he gives himself special permission to enjoy extra treats and privileges. According to my assessment of the astrological omens, you now have the right to give yourself similar permission—even though I don’t expect you’ll be broken or feeling down. Think of it as a reward for the brave work you’ve been doing lately. Enjoy this chocolatey grace period! CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): (1907–1972) was a Jewish theologian born under the sign of Capricorn. He wrote, “Indifference to the sublime wonder of living is the root of sin.” That’s a different definition of sin from what we’re used to! To be a moral person, Heschel believed, you must be in “radical amazement” about the glories of creation. I hope you will cultivate such an attitude in the coming weeks, Capricorn. It would be a mistake for you to numbly take things for granted. I dare you to cultivate as much awe, reverence, and adoration as you can muster. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): A blogger who calls herself Hopeful Melancholy wrote a message to her lover. She said, “My favorite position is the one where you work on your paintings and I work on my book, but we’re in the same room and occasionally smile at each other.” You might want to consider trying experiments comparable to that one in the coming weeks, Aquarius. The time will be fertile for you and your dear allies to work side-by-side; to cheer each other on and lift each other up; to explore new ways of cultivating companionship and caring for each other. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Dick Dudley was a 17th-century swindler. Among his many victims was the Pope. Dudley offered an item for sale that he claimed was a divine relic: a piece of the beard of St. Peter, founder of the Roman Catholic Church. The Pope paid Dudley a small fortune for the treasure, and kissed it copiously. Only later did the full story emerge: The so-called beard was in fact a wig. I hope you don’t get involved in switcheroos like that anytime soon, Pisces. Make sure that the goods or services you’re receiving—and offering, for that matter—are exactly what they’re supposed to be. ARIES (March 21-April 19): Here are examples of activities I recommend you try in the coming days. 1. Build a campfire on the beach with friends and regale each other with stories of your most interesting successes. 2. Buy eccentric treasures at a flea market and ever thereafter refer to them as your holy icons. 3. Climb a hill and sit on the grass as you sing your favorite songs and watch the moon (full tonight) slowly rise over the eastern horizon. 4. Take naps when you’re “not supposed to.” 5. Tell a beloved person a fairy tale in which he or she is the hero. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): The popular American TV sitcom produced 138 episodes in seven seasons. At the height of its success, it crammed an average of 9.57 jokes into every minute. Its comic richness derived in large part from multi-talented Taurus star Tina Fey, who created the show and played one of its main characters. She was also a writer and executive producer. I propose we make her your role model in the coming weeks. According to my projections, you’re entering a charismatic, ebullient, and creative phase of your astrological cycle. It’s time to be generous to the parts of your life that need big happy doses of release and liberation. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): I got an email from a Gemini reader named Jaylah. She wrote, “Hi, not sure if you remember me, but in our past lives, you and I used to write sacred cuneiform texts on clay tablets while sitting across from each other in a cave in Mesopotamia 4,910 years ago. Your name was Nabu. Mine was Tashmetu. I was always a little jealous because you earned more money than I, but it didn’t get in the way of our friendship. Anyway, if you ever want to catch up about the old days, give me a holler.” I loved receiving this inquiry from a soul I may have known in a previous incarnation. And what she did by reaching out to me happens to be the perfect type of activity for you Geminis right now. Secrets of your history may be more available than usual. The past may have new stories to tell. A resource from yesteryear could prove valuable in the future. CANCER (June 21-July 22): Cancerian-born was an interesting writer and a master of language. But even for him, it could be a challenge to convey what he really meant. He said, “I am constantly trying to communicate something incommunicable, to explain something inexplicable, to tell about something I only feel in my bones and which can only be experienced in those bones.” Now here’s the good news, as far as you’re concerned, Cancerian: I suspect that in the coming weeks, you will have more power than usual to do exactly what Kafka aspired to do. You will be able to summon extra ease and grace in expressing your truths. I invite you to be a connoisseur of deep conversations. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): “If we wait until we are ready, we will be waiting for the rest of our lives,” declared novelist . This is good advice for you to heed right now. I really hope you avoid the temptation to wait around for the perfect moment before you begin. In my vision of your best approach, you will dive into the future without trying to have all your plans finalized and all your assets gathered. I expect you will acquire the rest of what you need once the process is underway.

"A teenager who rescued a bumblebee says it’s now a loyal pet, following her everywhere, and even sleeping in a jar by her bed. It all started two weeks ago when Lacey Shillinglaw, 13, spotted the large bumblebee lying in the road while walking her dog. She scooped up the bee and noticed it had a crumpled wing. She tried to put it in a safer spot, on some flowers in a nearby park, but it refused to stay put, buzzing back over to Lacey and crawling all over her, and after an hour she gave up and headed home with the creature perched on her shoulder. Despite repeated attempts to leave the insect outside, the buzzy friend has refused to leave Lacey’s side. Now recovered and named Betty, it follows her to the shops and even stayed with Lacey during games at the bowling alley with 14 friends. She stayed on Lacey throughout both games—for two-and-a-half hours. “I’m so happy and I just love spending my time with her,” said the girl from Coventry, West Midlands. “She’s so fluffy and I love our friendship.” On the way home Betty was perching on the girl’s glasses as she went into her local shop to buy milk—shocking other shoppers. The insect apparently enjoys nibbling on Lacey’s food, but also gets fed sugar water, honey, and strawberry jam. Lacey takes her bee-pal into the garden to feast on flower nectar, but as soon as the teen goes back inside, Betty is right beside her. At night Lacey tucks Betty up in a little pot beside her bed, and while there is no lid, the animal stays put until morning. : During the day Betty nestles on the back of Lacey’s neck, or inside her sleeve, between buzzes around the living room. “It’s completely lovely—and also bonkers,” said her mother, Laura. “Betty climbs in Lacey’s long hair like it’s some kind of jungle. “She’s on her 90% of the time during the day, including her face, her glasses, and even in between her toes. It’s so beautiful—just gorgeous.” Betty apparently even enjoys a stroke between the wings, but steers clear of the rest of the family—mom, dad and two younger siblings. : “We have all the doors open a lot and she’s just never gone —I haven’t the foggiest why,” said Laura. Bumblebees sting and, unlike honeybees, they can repeatedly sting you without dying—but this has never happened because these two have become Bee-FFs. “Betty is totally amazing—I’ll remember this forever,” says Lacey. the video below…",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/teen-rescues-bumblebee-and-now-it-wont-leave-her-side/
"There’s a lot of talk about rewilding in Europe, where so much wild country has been eliminated over the last 1,000 years, but it usually comes from radical farmers, not death metal musician-filmmakers. That’s exactly who Randal Plunkett is: a living, working testament to the power of humanity to create change for a better future. In the face of his lifestyle (as a steak-eating body-building, death metalhead) and under the weight of his heritage (as the 21st Baron of Dunsany Castle in Ireland’s County Meath) Randal decided to take action to restore the dwindling number of truly wild spaces on the Emerald Isle by converting his entire 650-hectare (1,600-acre) estate into Ireland’s most ambitious rewilding project. First installed in Dunsany Castle in 1402, the Plunkett family is one of Ireland’s oldest clans of blue-bloods. A Plunkett was canonized after being executed by the Church of England in the 17th century, and another ancestor, Horace Plunkett, advocated on behalf of rural development and farming innovations during the early 20th century. “I’ve never been a country bumpkin,” Randall told “I saw it as a burden, a life of servitude.” Now though, concerns about the climate crisis and his country’s native ecosystem destruction has led him to turn his estate over to nature, letting grasses grow tall, and animals to run wild—a clean break from his ancestor Horace’s ideas of agriculture. “The reserve is pretty much left untouched, with natural processes left to reshape the landscape,” Randall, officially ‘Lord Dunsany,’ told the , which he recently joined. “There’s no drainage, and areas of grassland are left to be grazed by wild animals, such as deer.” “Otters have returned—the first time the species has been seen on the estate in my lifetime. We have pine martens, stoats, hedgehogs, foxes, badgers and barn owls. Red kite and snipe have returned. We have seen a big increase in insects—with a massive surge in butterflies—and we now see many different bat species. Even endangered Irish species such as corncrakes have come back. Nature really is flourishing,” he added. With several small streams meandering through what is mostly unforested land, there’s room for natural processes to stretch out and create that marvelous chaos most ecosystems need to make substantial, resilient food webs and habitat. Lord Dunsany doesn’t have much interest in opening the estate up to much more than small tour groups, but as a filmmaker, he does allow filming crews on to shoot, most recently for his own independent film , named for that most stunning shade of green that covers so much of Ireland, not least of which, his family estate. Private estates like those owned by historically royal families are often some of Europe’s best places to experiment with rewilding. places like Bunloit and Glenfeshie Estates in Scotland, and Ken Hill and Knepp Estates elsewhere, are often the only ones which have the large tracks of countryside that aren’t already deeply agricultural necessary to give rewilding a shot. As GNN reported last year, —a broke descendant of lords who couldn’t farm his land anymore turned it into an English wildland safari, creating one of England’s most biodiverse areas and wiping out his debts at the same time.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/randall-plunkett-turns-dunsany-castle-county-meath-into-rewilding-project-in-ireland/

"An ocean of kindness has swept over a loving mom and her son after strangers learned about her ingenuity in the face of poverty—and it inspired a whole community. Tiffany Holloway wrote a post on Reddit about how her son wanted a stuffed manta ray for his 5th birthday. She couldn’t afford to buy one so she crafted one—and made it out of his old baby blanket. The with button eyes became the No.1 post on Reddit (the largest online forum in the world) and soon hundreds of readers were sending Jason toy manta rays, squids, and other plush ocean creatures. But the fun didn’t stop there for the Oklahoma tot and his siblings. One Redditor, who wants to remain anonymous, contacted the Blue Zoo and had them hold a $100 gift card for the family, which they used for admission, so that Jonas— whose hero is Steve Irwin—could see and touch some sting rays. Jennifer Prokop (username ) bought Tiffany and her four boys tickets to the Oklahoma City Zoo, as well as four tickets to feed the sting rays. “Jonas got to see and touch and even feed his favorite animal,” Tiffany told GNN. “Jennifer and I have become fast friends. She is an amazing kind person with a big heart.” They stayed alongside the pool for over an hour, even as most guests moved on after a few minutes. “The boys loved it.” “My son’s favorite part of all this is having a bunch of sea friends to cuddle with at night.

"Finding fossilized dinosaur eggs is not unheard of, but finding the fossilized remains of an embryo within the egg is rare indeed. Fortunately for a pair of paleontologists working in one of Earth’s great honeypot regions for dinosaur bones—North China—a local farmer had a few gems lying around to check over and inspect. In a box of what the farmer believed were strange, intriguing rocky orbs, scientists Fenglu Han and Haishui Jiang noticed one that was different enough to merit closer examination. The bony remains of the treasure contained within the eggshell were the only clues the scientists had to its origin, and while the farmer led them to the site where he found it, subsequently discovered specimens had held up very poorly over the years. Egg in possession, Jiang and Han looked to examine it using micro-computed tomography, which would allow them to peer through the shell’s exterior. What they found was a jumble of bones which consultants determined looked strikingly like a turtle embryo. Belonging to an extinct genus of giant land tortoises called that lived among the Cretaceous period—the geological curtain call of the age of dinosaurs—the find “is one of the largest and thickest shelled Mesozoic turtle eggs known,” write the authors in a in The turtle which laid the egg would have been among the largest turtles to ever exist, and from shell tip to shell tail would have been as tall as a grown man. How the turtle might have lived is difficult to imagine. All scientists know was that it was a plant eater, but the details within the eggshell may hint at what its habitat was like when it lived 144 to 66 million years ago. “The thick-shelled, spherical eggs of may have been an adaptation, at least in part, to incubation in harsh arid environments,” write the authors in their paper. “Among [living] turtles, a calcified rigid shell limits the movement of water outside the eggshell to prevent excess water loss of the egg during incubation. Spherical eggs can also reduce water loss and thickened eggshell in some reptiles may be an adaptation to an arid climate.” As scientists discussed, the baby turtle would have to be a little Hercules to push his way out of such a thick shell. While went extinct along with the non-avian dinosaurs, their aquatic relatives sailed right on through, along with other success stories like crocodiles, snakes, and ocean life.

"Major moments from modern history have been reimagined as ‘ancient’ cave art. 2,000 UK adults had their say on what moments from the worlds of sport, technology, politics, and popular culture should be immortalized in Buckinghamshire’s Hellfire Caves. Using the same techniques, style, and colors as our ancestors more than 30,000 years ago, illustrator Emmy Smith worked with archaeologist Professor Paul Pettitt to make the paintings as authentic as possible. Other noteworthy moments featured include Barack Obama becoming the first Black President of America, Live Aid, and Maradona’s ‘Hand of God’. commissioned the cave art and the poll to celebrate the launch of new historical strategy game, HUMANKIND, which enables players to create and lead their own unique civilization. Paul Pettitt, Professor in the Department of Archaeology at Durham University, said: “Ancient humans used cave art for thousands of years to record the most important concerns of their time. “And I’m thrilled SEGA has used the oldest artistic medium to bring some of modern history’s most iconic moments to life. “Rock art was a universal form of expression, with examples found all over the world. “It was an enjoyable challenge working out how to translate the events of the last few decades, both monumental and mundane, into authentic cave art—I’m extremely proud of the results.” The poll found 72 percent of adults believe it’s ‘important’ that key events from modern history are shared with future generations. And 62 percent think cave art is a great way to learn about history from those who lived during that time. Furthermore, 51 percent think cave paintings are more likely to survive for thousands of years than any form of modern technology. More than half (51 percent) also think cave paintings are more likely to survive for thousands of years than any form of modern technology. It also emerged that those polled think Sir David Attenborough (27 percent) would be the best person to lead modern civilization. But Manchester United and England star, Marcus Rashford (eight percent) got twice as many votes as current UK prime minister, Boris Johnson (four percent). While 34 percent think they would do either a good or excellent job if they themselves were in charge. Their priorities would include providing free healthcare to all (46 percent), ensuring equal rights for everyone (36 percent), and implementing a four-day working week (19 percent).

"It’s hard work being a farmer, that is until you pull a half-ton sapphire out of the ground while digging a well… Then it’s pretty incredible being a farmer. A boulder containing a cluster of 2.5 million carats in star sapphires was unearthed by workmen digging a well on the island of Sri Lanka, a country which, like a diamond, belittles its size in terms of richness. Colored pale blue, the find has been given the name the ‘Serendipity Sapphire’, and could be worth $140 million on the international market, pending inspections and certification by world experts. “The person who was digging the well alerted us about some rare stones. Later we stumbled upon this huge specimen,” Mr. Gamage, the owner of the stone, . Gamage, who kept most information confidential for obvious reasons, explained that while cleaning the stone of mud and dirt, some star sapphires of “high quality” became dislodged, suggesting that like , this enormous half-ton stone isn’t a single structure, but likely hundreds of star sapphires connected together with other minerals. In a country blessed with beautiful beaches, rich wildlife, tons of elephants, and as the story goes, the mountain from which the Buddha of this eon ascended to Buddhahood, the gemstone trade on Sri Lanka is one of the most important on Earth. The island nation, no bigger than West Virginia, is the world’s leading exporter of sapphires and other precious stones, which generated half a billion in revenue last year as gem producers. The Serendipity Sapphire was mined in the area of Ratnapura, a traditional gem mining region famous for producing star sapphires, like the last one that was considered the largest ever, , weighing 1404 carets. Ratnapura means “City of Gems” in Sinhalese, and even as competitive markets for sapphires open up in Madagascar, Ratnapura remains a world capital in the gem trade. “It is a special star sapphire specimen, probably the biggest in the world. Given the size and its value, we think it will interest private collectors or museums,” Thilak Weerasinghe, the Chairman of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority of Sri Lanka, told the BBC. Star sapphires contain a gemological feature known as an asterism. Asterisms in gems occur when small flakes or spines of other material becomes trapped in the gemstone as it forms, creating an effect when receiving light from above of a shining six-pointed star. , currently held in the American Museum of Natural History.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/2-5-million-caret-sapphire-discovered-in-sri-lanka-weighing-half-a-ton/
"4Ocean, the guys who you may have seen on Instagram selling bracelets made out of ocean plastic as a way to fund their ocean cleanup, have enlisted the help of new and extra-special beachcomber in their land-based campaign to end ocean plastic pollution. The electric-powered, sand-sifting BeBot can clean up to 3,000 square meters, or 33,000 square feet, of beach per hour, making it 20-30x more effective than collecting trash by hand. The machine is agile and easy to maneuver, a clear differentiator from existing options which tend to be derived from retired agricultural equipment powered by gas, making them less-suited to delicate beach work. It specifically excels at removing small pieces of plastic and other trash that are notoriously difficult to clean by hand, using small 1 cm x 1 cm sifting grids to separate these items from the sand. A pair of triangular tracks gives the BeBot a smaller footprint, while a shallower cleaning depth of 10 cm effectively removes common beach trash while avoiding disruptions to any nearby habitats or animals, providing a more effective and sustainable approach to cleanups. A remote-controlled robot, the beach-cleaner can be operated from up to 950 feet away. BeBot comes out of a marine-technology firm called , that among many other projects such as robotics, specializes in building aluminum marinas. They construct floating solar panel banks, and other cool aqua-tech like the “mooring star,” which is essentially a giant addition sign that allows nature parks to greatly increase their boat mooring potential whilst protecting shorelines. “BeBot has groundbreaking and unprecedented environmental assets,” Claire Touvier, member of the Environmental Solutions team from Poralu Marine. “With a unique track system distributing equal and minimum pressure on the sand, BeBot reduces erosion. This innovative design also helps the preservation of biodiversity as it prevents the compression of turtles’ eggs and any vegetal ecosystem in the sand.” “We are always searching for innovative technology to improve our cleanup capabilities,” said Alex Schultze, co-founder of “With the launch of the BeBot, we are able to work smarter and sustainably while recovering plastic that has already seen the ocean and preventing new plastic from ever getting there in the first place.” In a statement, 4Ocean revealed that they were on track to remove their twenty millionth pound of plastic trash from the ocean, despite lifting pound number sixteen million just one month ago. This is a more than 100% increase from 16 months before when they were “closing in” on their eight millionth pound, a milestone it took them almost three years to reach.

"Polish javelin thrower Maria Andrejczyk took the silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics. While she might have come in second at the games, what she did next was pure gold. Less than two weeks after ascending the winner’s podium, Andrejczyk took an extraordinary leap of generosity, auctioning off her medal to raise funds for Miłoszek Małys, an 8-month-old Polish boy in critical need of heart surgery. The athlete had never met Miłoszek or his family. She learned of his struggles through social media. But 25-year-old Andrejczyk, a cancer survivor herself, knew just how important obtaining timely medical intervention could be. “Miłoszek has a serious heart defect, he needs an operation,” Andrejczyk posted to her . “He also has support from above from Kubuś—a boy who did not make it on time, but wonderful people decided to donate his funds to Miłoszek. And this is how I want to help too. It is for him that I am auctioning off my Olympic silver medal.” All told, it was estimated that costs for medical expenses plus travel from Poland to California’s Stanford University where the operation would be performed would total 1.5 million Polish zlotys (about $385,000). With half the sum already raised through online contributions, Andrejczyk hoped her medal would bring in the rest. The winning bid not only met but exceeded the original fundraising goals. “We have the winner!” Andrejczyk posted. “On Friday I received this wonderful information, and due to the fact that you dears have already done wonders and joint forces have paid more than the equivalent of the initial medal to the Miłoszek account—I decided to end the auction so that our Miłoszek will receive the whole amount as soon as possible and can fly to the USA.” Sorry as she might have been to see her medal go, Andrejczyk was thrilled to know the profits from its sale were earmarked for a worthy cause. “The true value of a medal always remains in the heart,” Andrejczyk said, as quoted by . “A medal is only an object, but it can be of great value to others. This silver can save lives, instead of collecting dust in a closet. That is why I decided to auction it to help sick children.” But it seems the winning bidders, Polish convenience store chain Zabka, had some pretty big-hearted plans of their own. In honor of her winning ways both on the Olympic field and off, the company gifted Andrejczyk back her medal. “We were moved by the beautiful and extremely noble gesture of our Olympian, we decided to support [the benefit],” Zabka posted to Facebook. “We also decided that the silver medal from Tokyo will stay with Ms. Maria, who showed what it means to be [a true champion].” While silver has always been considered a precious metal, in this case, its value in helping save the life of a child was priceless—and that’s a win of Olympic proportions for everyone.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/maria-andrejczyk-auctions-silver-medal-for-infants-heart-surgery/
"A quartet of manufacturing firms has managed to create the world’s first fossil fuel-free steel in Sweden, much of which will go straight into the foundries of Volvo to create the first cars ever made with “green steel.” It’s a massive first step to decarbonizing a carbon-heavy industry, as steel-making worldwide accounts for 8% of all CO2 emissions resulting from the need for coal in the manufacturing process, and the firms involved in the discovery represent 10% of Sweden’s emissions, and 7% of Finland’s. Since the Warring States period in Ancient China, and , metalworkers have understood that to take a useful metal, iron, and turn it into a superior alloy, steel, they needed very high heat and a bit of coal. Today, that coal is being replaced with hydrogen by Swedish venture firm HYBRIT, owned by Swedish steelmaker SSAB, the state-owned utility Vattenfall, and the mining firm LKAB. HYBRIT’s method to create the high temperatures and carbon necessary to replace coal in their steel. Their hope is to get green steel into the bodies of Volvo cars as soon as possible, and into the global circulating market “The first fossil-free steel in the world is not only a breakthrough for SSAB, it represents proof that it’s possible to make the transition and significantly reduce the global carbon footprint of the steel industry. We hope that this will inspire others to also want to speed up the green transition,” says Martin Lindqvist, President and CEO of SSAB. Hardly resting on this remarkable achievement, HYBRIT and its backers are looking to ensure the steel plant and the boilers needed to heat the hydrogen to 1,000°C (1,832°F) for their manufacturing process is run by fossil fuel-free power sources. They are focused on electric gas heating, and their plant in Luleå, Sweden will trial a 250 kilowatt boiler. If it goes well, a megawatt version will be developed. “This is one of many exciting steps among all the development taking place within the fossil-free value chain,” Eva Vitell, GM of Hybrit Development AB. Iron ore for steel manufacturing is the world’s second most-traded commodity behind crude oil, and any developments towards making that process greener represents massive potential emissions cuts.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/swedish-company-hybrit-makes-fossil-fuel-free-green-steel-from-hydrogen/
"The seat of power for one of the most influential women in Medieval English history, Queen Cynethryth, has been discovered in a small Berkshire village. A lost monastery in Cookham where Cynethryth ruled as abbess was located by a team from the University of Reading and local volunteers, and consists of the timber remains of buildings where the monks and nuns lived, as well as artifacts such as jewelry, crockery, and personal items. Cynethryth was the wife of King Offa. The two ruled the old kingdom of Mercia in the four decades before the arrival of the Vikings in 793CE, and were determined to bring Christian values and better court decorum to their land. “Cynethryth is a fascinating figure, a female leader who clearly had genuine status and influence in her lifetime,” Dr. Gabor Thomas, the University of Reading archaeologist leading the excavation. “The items that have been uncovered will allow us to piece together a detailed impression of how the monks and nuns who lived here ate, worked and dressed. This will shed new light on how Anglo-Saxon monasteries were organized and what life was like in them,” he said. While the details of almost anyone living in Britain during this period—even a king or queen, are scant, two discoveries bear testimony to the power wielded by Cynethryth during her life. Coins minted during the reign of Offa and Cynethryth featured her visage, one of very few examples in all of Western Europe, much less England, and when King Offa exchanged letters with his opposite number in France (Charlemagne), to whom he considered himself equal, Charlemagne would address the letters to both Offa and Cynethryth by name. Writing by Susan Abernethy at The Medievalists tells us that people in the know—in this case a poet/teacher/English scholar/ecclesiastical figure named Alcuin who was a contemporary of Offa and Cynethryth—considered her very important indeed. “In a letter Alcuin wrote during Offa’s reign, he hints that Cynethryth was too busy with the king’s business to read correspondence,” . In another letter he designates her as ‘mistress of the royal household’ and calls her pious. Alcuin emphasizes the legitimacy of her marriage with Offa and the legitimacy of her children and their suitability to inherit the throne of Mercia.” The discovery of her monastery was made along the River Thames on the grounds of the modern Holy Trinity Church, a rumored location of the monastery where, following the passing of her husband, she ruled as “royal abbess” from the year 796 until her death. The monastery’s position along the Thames is not only the modern border of Berkshire, but during the 790s was also the disputed border between Mercia and another Medieval kingdom called Wessex, highlighting the political and strategic importance of the site. Livia Gershon, writing for “excavations showed that the building was constructed on a gravel island that raised it above areas that faced frequent flooding. The site was divided into zones, including a housing area and another with a cluster of hearths that were probably used for metalworking.” As a religious and royal figure, the team from Reading expect that her remains are to be found at the site, an incredibly exciting potential discovery, as the physical remains of a person can be used to create 3D imaging of what the powerful queen might have looked like.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cynethyrth-medieval-queens-lost-monastery-found-by-the-thames-river/
"Supportive social interactions in adulthood are important for your ability to stave off cognitive decline, a new study finds. Researchers observed that simply having someone available most or all of the time whom you can count on to listen to you when you need to talk is associated with greater cognitive resilience—a measure of your brain’s ability to function better than would be expected for the amount of physical aging—or disease-related changes in the brain, which many neurologists believe can be boosted by engaging in mentally stimulating activities, physical exercise, and positive social interactions. “We think of cognitive resilience as a buffer to the effects of brain aging and disease,” says lead researcher Joel Salinas, MD, the Lulu P. and David J. Levidow Assistant Professor of Neurology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and member of the Department of Neurology’s Center for Cognitive Neurology. “This study adds to growing evidence that people can take steps, either for themselves or the people they care about most, to increase the odds they’ll slow down cognitive aging or prevent the development of symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease—something that is all the more important given that we still don’t have a cure for the disease.” An estimated 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease, a progressive condition that affects mostly those over 65 and interferes with memory, language, decision-making, and the ability to live independently. Salinas says that while the disease usually affects an older population, the results of this study indicate that people younger than 65 would benefit from taking stock of their social support. For every unit of decline in brain volume, individuals in their 40s and 50s with low listener availability had a cognitive age that was four years older than those with high listener availability. “These four years can be incredibly precious. Too often we think about how to protect our brain health when we’re much older, after we’ve already lost a lot of time decades before to build and sustain brain-healthy habits,” says Salinas. “But today, right now, you can ask yourself if you truly have someone available to listen to you in a supportive way, and ask your loved ones the same. Taking that simple action sets the process in motion for you to ultimately have better odds of long-term brain health and the best quality of life you can have.” Salinas also recommends that physicians consider adding this question to the standard social history portion of a patient interview: asking patients whether they have access to someone they can count on to listen to them when they need to talk. “Loneliness is one of the many symptoms of depression, and has other health implications for patients,” says Salinas. “These kinds of questions about a person’s social relationships and feelings of loneliness can tell you a lot about a patient’s broader social circumstances, their future health, and how they’re really doing outside of the clinic.” Researchers used one of the longest running and most closely monitored community-based cohorts in the U.S., the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), as the source of their study’s 2,171 participants, with an average age of 63. FHS participants self-reported information on the availability of supportive social interactions including listening, good advice, love and affection, sufficient contact with people they’re close with, and emotional support. Study participants’ cognitive resilience was measured as the relative effect of total cerebral brain volume on global cognition, using MRI scans and neuropsychological assessments taken as part of the FHS. Lower brain volumes tend to associate with lower cognitive function, and in this study, researchers examined the modifying effect of individual forms of social support on the relationship between cerebral volume and cognitive performance. The cognitive function of individuals with greater availability of one specific form of social support was higher relative to their total cerebral volume. This key form of social support was listener availability and it was highly associated with greater cognitive resilience. Researchers note that further study of individual social interactions may improve understanding of the biological mechanisms that link psychosocial factors to brain health. “While there is still a lot that we don’t understand about the specific biological pathways between psychosocial factors like listener availability and brain health, this study gives clues about concrete, biological reasons why we should all seek good listeners and become better listeners ourselves,” says Salinas of the study, which was published on August 16 in",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nyu-study-cognitive-relience-alzheimers-connection-listening/
"Indiana could be the first state in the Union to have a wireless charging road that tops up your electric vehicle as you drive along it. As the 21st century rolls on, we’ve all had those one or two moments where we see some new technology and the pace of innovation really comes home to roost in our heads, normally with some recollection of or . Maybe for some it would have been the self-driving feature of the Tesla, or smart home systems, but for motorists in Indiana, that moment may come by way of a shiny new wireless road. While range and battery charging times , it’s still the most limiting factor when it comes to the purchase of an EV. The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) has decided to tackle that by burying electrified wire coils that create a magnetic field along the road surface, mimicking the way wireless charging stations for tablets and phones are designed. In order to use the roads, cars would be fitted with a receiver coil to pick up the charge as they go along, and becoming magnetized, draw electricity from the coils themselves. Expected to take three phases, the work will begin in late summer, according to a statement from the contracted German firm in charge of designing and installing the technology, Magment. “This project is a real step forward towards the future of dynamic wireless charging,” Mauricio Esguerra, CEO of Magment, “that will undoubtedly set the standard for affordable, sustainable, and efficient transportation electrification.” Copper prices are pretty high these days; early in spring they were at an all-time record, so Magment are ditching copper wire coils for recycled ferrite, will allow them to “achieve transmission efficiency of up to 95% and be built at standard road-building installation costs,” according to Singularity Hub. If the cost savings are real, then it could start production quite soon following two planned lab tests. It’s the first such electrified charging road in the U.S., and is a projection by researchers working on charging roads at the University of Cornell that it would be 5-10 years before such technology would be available.

"As the world’s premier home furnishings retailer, IKEA has for decades been forgetting to offer consumers the most important home furnishing of them all: electricity. Being that the largest furniture retailer on Earth has a new pledge to cut emissions by 50% by 2030 and get to carbon neutrality by 2050, IKEA has decided to fill in that gap with clean energy, allowing customers to buy wind and solar electricity and infrastructure from IKEA. Part of these emissions calculations represent a remarkable display of responsibility, as the group looks at sales of electrical appliances, and factor in the electricity used to power them before adding that figure to their climate targets. “At IKEA, we want to become fully circular and climate positive by 2030, built on renewable energy and resources. We believe the future of energy is renewable and we want to make electricity from sustainable sources more accessible and affordable for all,” stated Jan Gardberg, New Retail Business Manager, Ingka Group. Since 2016 the Ingka Group, which manages 367 of the 423 worldwide stores, ($2.76 billion) in renewable energy, including two solar parks in the U.S., a wind farm in Romania, and 534 wind turbines in 14 countries. They’ve also installed nearly a million solar panels on their stores, and market IKEA-brand solar panels to 11 world markets. As well as powering their furniture fueled empire, this renewable energy can now be bought by customers. Through the STRÖMMA offer, customers who live in Sweden from solar and wind, and use an app to track their own electricity usage. Customers who have already bought solar panels from IKEA can also track their own production in the app and sell back the electricity they don’t use themselves. So far their home country is the only one in which IKEA customers can buy electricity, but considering the brand now owns 100 more wind turbines than stores, it won’t be long before they enter the utilities markets elsewhere. IKEA have just joined up with H&M, Walmart, and Kingfisher Group to start the , aimed at taking the lead in the retail industry towards reducing global warming to below levels outlined by the IPCC. Like IKEA’s personal targets, the Race to Zero pledge involves halving emissions by 2030 and becoming neutral by 2050, a massive challenge for any company in retail where the industry thrives off of large-scale, cheap production and sales. “At IKEA, we have committed to becoming climate positive by 2030 and as part of that, we are also committed to the 1.5°C goal in the Paris Agreement. This movement seeks to engage the retail sector and by working together and acting with speed, focusing on what makes real impact, we can truly make a difference.

"After over a year of empty classrooms, dusty bookshelves, and quiet playgrounds, many students across the U.S. are finally returning to school. For teachers, that means working to gather vital school supplies to cover classroom work and fun. Unfortunately, teachers are often forced to juggle tight budgets to cover all the essentials. Thankfully, has become a fantastic platform for filling any gaps—and T-Mobile is stepping in to help with a $1,000,000 donation. DonorsChoose lets educators ask the public for the classroom materials they need to ensure students’ success. For example, in Minnesota, Mrs. Wamsley is asking for an SD card and camera bag for her yearbook class. In New Jersey, Mrs. Trasferini is wishing for a Book Nook for her second-grade class. And Mrs. Robertson would like support in buying an easel pad and headphones for her first graders. With T-Mobile’s $1 million donation, DonorsChoose will be able to fulfill these and other requests and help jumpstart the transition back to an in-person learning environment. DonorsChoose makes the process easy, purchasing and shipping items directly to the school and sending a thank you note to the donor. “This coming school year might be the most important of our generation, and teachers will need all the encouragement we can give them as so many return to classrooms,” says DonorsChoose Founder and CEO, Charles Best. “T-Mobile’s gift to teachers will help students start the year strong and support them during a time of readjustment.” But getting essential school supplies is just half the battle. The stay-at-home orders implemented in many states forced families to work and learn from home for months, relying on high-speed internet and wireless connectivity. Over the last year, lack of home internet has substantially widened the digital divide for many students. T-Mobile has been stepping up to help mitigate this technological burden. This year, T-Mobile is continuing their work with —their $10.7 billion initiative to provide 10 million underserved households with free internet and mobile hotspots over the next 10 years. “Back-to-school is special this year,” acknowledges Jon Freier, EVP of T-Mobile’s Consumer Group. “It represents getting back to so much more that we’ve missed, after a really trying year for families, teachers, and students. That’s why T-Mobile is going big here to help everyone stay connected with America’s largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network.” For families, teachers, and students gearing up for a new school year and looking for a new phone, T- Mobile is now when you switch and activate on the Magenta MAX rate plan—no trade required.

Harvard graduate Allyson Reneau has 11 kids of her own, but there was still plenty of room in her heart for the , a.k.a. “the Afghan Dreamers.” Reneau and the tight-knit group bonded back in 2019 when they met at a Washington D.C.-based Humans to Mars summit. (Having nine biological daughters probably helped.) In the weeks building up to the recent Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, Reneau became increasingly concerned for the girls’ welfare. Unable to shake the fear the Dreamers were in imminent danger, Reneau became frustrated by the lack of cooperation at home in the U.S. to secure their safety. Rather than wait, she decided to head to the sanctuary country of Qatar, hoping to use the connections she had there to help expedite a rescue. In conjunction with the Dreamers’ parent organization , and the Qatar Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Reneau was able to pull some strings and get the exit process rolling. Soon enough, 10 robotics team members between the ages of 16 and 18 were boarded on a commercial flight. (Some members of the team and the girls’ families have yet to leave Kabul. Efforts to secure their relocation are ongoing.) After receiving word from the girls to say they’d made it out of Kabul, Reneau was overcome with emotion. “I got a text from one of the girls that just said: ‘We did it.’ All the emotion from two weeks of work and running into a wall constantly, and burying your feelings, and bearing your feelings for the girls, it just hit me all at once,” Reneau told . DCF board member Elizabeth Schaeffer Brown says that while it took the combined efforts of several entities to ensure the girls’ release, she credits their own grit and self-determination as a key factor in the successful outcome. “Ultimately the girls ‘rescued’ themselves,” Brown told . “If it were not for their hard work and courage to pursue an education, which brought them in contact with the world, they would still be trapped. We need to continue to support them and others like them.” Since arriving in Qatar, the girls have been inundated with numerous scholarships from several prestigious U.S. universities, and Reneau is confident they will make the most of those opportunities. “For the first time in their life, I really believe they have the freedom to choose and to be the architects of their own destiny and their own future,” Reneau told Insider. “It’s the freeing feeling to me to know that they will be able to go somewhere and get educated wherever they want.” And isn’t that what every loving mom wants for her kids?",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/afghan-all-girls-robotics-team-get-us-scholarships/
"A self-proclaimed hermit who became unintentionally famous after losing his home to a fire is about to get new digs thanks to generous donations to a GoFundMe campaign—and one whopping big check from a philanthropist. 81-year-old ‘River Dave’, whose real name is David Lidstone, had been living off-the-grid in the same secluded New Hampshire location for almost three decades. He didn’t own the property where he’d built his modest A-frame cabin on the banks of the Merrimack River, but says he had permission from the site’s previous owner to stay there. Citing environmental and zoning violations, the current owner, however, took steps to have him removed. On the same day that Lidstone appeared in court charged with civil contempt for refusing to vacate, his cabin burnt to the ground. While the cause was most likely accidental rather than arson, the result remained the same. River Dave—along with his cats and his chickens—was out of a home. Estranged from his wife and family, for most of his 27-year tenure on the 73-acre plot of timberland, Lidstone kept to himself. He did, however, occasionally befriend a passing kayaker or boater, and those ties proved strong enough to form an unexpected lifeline. Prior to the legal contretemps, longtime friend Jodie Gedeon hoped the situation between the landowner and Lidstone would come to a peaceful resolution. The owner’s lawyers thought otherwise, but after the fire, the point became moot. With Lidstone now homeless, Gedeon and friend Sharon Copello quickly organized a to help River Dave get back on his feet. As word of his plight spread, donations and offers of places to stay began to roll in. While the response was staggering and the initial $15,000 funding goal was quickly met, no one could have predicted what came next. On August 11, New Hampshire resident and billionaire CEO of Palantir Technologies Alexander Karp reached out to Lidstone and wrote him a personal check to the tune of $180,000 for living and future expenses. “I hope each of you are sitting down and have a tissue or two next to you as what I am going to share is part of the happy ending to come and I can’t imagine a dry eye anywhere after you read this,” Gedeon posted to her Facebook page of the generous donation. Lidstone needed a few hankies himself. “How can I express myself and my gratitude towards something like that? I start to tear up whenever I think about it,” Lidstone told the . “For an old logger who always had to work, for anyone to give you that type of money, it’s incredibly difficult for me to get my head around.” The monies raised for River Dave are being put into a trust for him. For reasons of privacy, he’ll be staying at an undisclosed location over the winter, and sometime next year, at a building site as yet to be named, construction for his new home will begin. “I feel about as good as I ever have in my life,” a grateful Lidstone told AP, although admitted the recent outpouring of kindness and support has been something of a revelation to him. “Maybe the things I’ve been trying to avoid are the things that I really need in life… I grew up never being hugged or kissed, or [having] any close contact… “I had somebody ask me once, about my wife: ‘Did you really love her?’ And the question kind of shocked me for a second. [I’d] never loved anybody in my life. And I shocked myself because I hadn’t realized that. And that’s why I was a hermit. Now I can see love being expressed that I never had before.” Meanwhile, as the GoFundMe campaign winds down at the end of August, Gedeon hopes to keep paying the love forward. “We feel we can help Dave build a good life now and will forever be thankful,” she posted. “We also know how many other charities and people are in need of help. At the end of the month, we’re asking that the spotlight be passed on to others to bring awareness and opportunities to spread the love and continue to be the change! “The world is a better place with each of you in it and we simply can’t thank you enough.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/hermit-gets-180k-for-cabin-river-dave/

"A pesticide that appears to damage the health of children and farm workers has been banned from future use in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after facing a slew of lawsuits. Sprayed on apples, strawberries, citrus fruit, corn, alfalfa, grapes, cotton, almonds, walnuts, and broccoli since 1965, the organophosphate pesticide called chlorpyrifos to intellectual impairment, loss of working memory, and reduced IQ in children, as well as damage to of infants’ brains. It also impacts the health . In a major agriculture state, banned chlorpyrifos, but the EPA ruled that there was not enough evidence to do the same federally—until legal challenges resulted in a court judge ruling the onus was on the EPA to present indisputable proof that the pesticide did not cause harm in children. As it could not do so, as of August 20th the agency banned producers from using chlorpyrifos. The environmental-focused organization Earthjustice says it will continue its quest to ban all organophosphate pesticides from farms, even if they are used in non-food applications. One reason is because the spraying of the toxin is airborne and can drift to non-intended targets. For now, “Chlorpyrifos will finally be out of our fruits and vegetables,” Patti Goldman, an attorney for Earthjustice. “Children will no longer be eating food tainted with a pesticide that causes intellectual learning disabilities,” In 2017, more than half of the 10.4 million pounds of organophosphate pesticides sprayed on American soils were chlorpyrifos, meaning the ban will lead to the eventually decontamination of half of the total chemical burden—a huge victory for millions.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/epa-bans-toxic-pesticide-chlorpyrifos/
"Smart algorithms are used to make calculations for data-driven science in a dizzying number of ways, but one man has used them to build a once-in-a-lifetime American experience. Dr. Randy Olson has created an algorithm that planned the optimal and ultimate U.S. National Parks road trip, featuring the most expedient route to visit the original 47 National Parks in the continental United States. The modern National Parks System was inspired in part by the increasing popularity of the automobile, and the U.S. interstate highway system was built to run through as many of the U.S. Parks as possible. As one can see in the Ken Burns documentary by the 1960s, taking your Ford or Chevy on a trip across the West was the quintessential American vacation, and the crown jewel of the tourism industry. The trip in total comes out to 14,498 miles (23,333 km), not counting rest stops, and will take about two months driving at what as a “breakneck pace,” though anyone looking for an enjoyable road trip will want to take in the scenery at each park, and realistically need more like 3-4 months to do such an adventure justice. Olson, who is the Chief Data Scientist at FOXO Bioscience, described the trip as a “circle,” by which he meant you could jump on the route at any point and go either way to visit the next 46 Parks. It is not by any means a circle around the perimeter of the US. For instance, when starting your travels by going westward from Minnesota’s northern lakes, the route plunges southward from North Dakota all the way down to the border between New Mexico and Colorado. It snakes westward into the Great Basin in Nevada, and climbs right back up again to Glacier NP on the border with Canada. This massive detour is on account of one of the five or six mega states in the National Park System, Utah, and its central location. But beyond that the trip is well planned as one can start at any point and face the same amount of driving as if they’d started anywhere else. Olson’s blog post about his route was a popular topic with his readers, and they enthusiastically flooded the comment section with suggestions, calculations on gasoline costs, advantages of RVs vs traditional sedans for better gas mileage, and other details. One commenter mentioned that cutting out the Florida parks, and Acadia National Park in Maine, would save a ton of time. Another popular discussion was regarding other types of land units managed by the National Parks Service—such as National Scenic Riverways, National Monuments, National Lakeshores. These define the spirit of the NPS, which is not only to protect those lands that the nation values most, but those that individual communities value too. Other suggestions for optimizing your trip include through New York to Maine, which would run through the mountains instead of the interstate, or managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management—which can save travelers many dollars in accommodations. Olson points out that you would need to have a flying car or airplane to efficiently visit the 12 parks located in America’s island territories, or in Alaska where there are eight parks, but his road trip does include the Channel Islands and Dry Tortugas, which require the use of boats for car and personal transport.

"A diffuser which “smells like fear” could help keep pests off garden plants, according to a new study. The special odor is made up of compounds produced by ladybugs, a natural predator of plant-eating insects which ravage gardens and crops. Pests which catch a whiff of the stuff will change their behavior, thinking predators are nearby. Plant-eating insects represent a major threat for gardeners and farmers’ crops around the world, especially as they can carry diseases and are becoming increasingly resistant to traditional pesticides. Now, researchers at Pennsylvania State University have come up with a sweet-smelling solution. Study author Dr Sara Hermann said, “It is not uncommon to use our senses to avoid risky situations. If a building was on fire, we as humans could use our senses of sight or smell to detect the threat. “There is evidence for such behavioral responses to risk across taxa that suggest prey organisms can detect predation threats, but the mechanisms for detection aren’t very well understood, especially with insects.” Aphids are highly destructive, and their ability to transmit plant diseases make them a persistent problem for growers. They also happen to be a favorite food of ladybugs, which gardeners and farmers welcome as a kind of natural pest-control. That is because aphids and other plant-eating insects will steer clear of fields if they can smell predators nearby, the researchers found. Smells given off by ladybugs signal aphids to stop reproducing as much and grow larger wings, both behaviors seen to avoid threats. The research team identified and extracted the ladybugs’ “volatile odour” using gas chromatography, a technique which separates the different components of a smell. Aphids were then exposed to each component individually to see which one got the biggest reaction. The strength of their response was based on the signal picked up by an electroantennogram machine, which is specifically designed to test insects’ reactions to odors. Of the many compounds emitted by ladybugs, the strongest response was to a class of chemical compounds known as methoxypyrazines. Specifically these included isopropyl methoxypyrazine, isobutyl methoxypyrazine, and sec-butyl methoxypyrazine. A special odor blend, which can be placed in an essential oil diffuser to spread the scent over time across a garden or field, was then created. are now hoping to test their diffusers outdoors to see whether they produce the same results. They are also looking to measure the diffusers’ dispersal area and see whether they could be applied to other pests, predators, and crops. Study co-author Dr Jessica Kansman added: “Insects rely on olfactory cues to find food, mates, and places to live, so this is a great opportunity to investigate how to use these smells to manipulate their behaviour.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/diffuser-that-smells-like-fear-and-could-keep-pests-off-garden-plants/
"The widest, and perhaps oldest single coral in the Great Barrier Reef has been discovered—and it’s in excellent health. Those are the findings of a new paper published in which reported the discovery of Muga dhambi, or “big coral” in the language of the Manbarra people, the traditional custodians of the Palm Islands, off of which the research team found the coral. Discovered near Goolboodi (Orpheus Island) in March 2021, the hemispherical Muga dhambi measured 5.3 meters tall (17 feet) and 10.4 meters wide (34 feet), making it the widest and sixth-tallest coral in the 2,900 reefs that make up the barrier system. “We were running a citizen science workshop… and were interested in exploring the North Coast of Goolbodhi which is a very remote area often restricted by weather,” Kaillash Cook, part of the workshop team and co-author of the new paper, told in an email. “It was here Dr. Adam Smith found this breathtaking coral and instantly assigned people to take measurements, surveys, and coordinates for the coral.” Belonging to the genus Muga dhambi is from one of 16 common coral species that form some of the largest and most important building blocks of nearshore corals, report Adam Smith and the rest of the team behind the research. Nevertheless, after consultation with tribal elders, it was determined that the coral was completely unknown by the Manbarra people, who were asked to give it a name, being that it resided in their sea-country. Other enormous have been found in the American Samoa, in the reef around the Green Island off the coast of Taiwan, and Sesoko Island, Okinawa. Based on yearly growth models, Muga dhambi was estimated at between 421 and 438 years old, an astonishing age to live to amid an ecosystem that’s described as a canary in a coal mine for climate change. “For shallow water corals, 438 year-old corals are very hard to come by,” cook admitted. “Australian Institute of Marine Sciences has investigated 328 colonies of massive corals on the Great Barrier Reef and the oldest they have found is 436 years old.” “While the age is currently an estimate based on measurements of other corals we can safely say that Muga dhambi is one of the oldest structures on the Great Barrier Reef,” said Cook. “After a torrid few years, the of the Great Barrier Reef has found that while COVID ran rampant above, the reef’s own pandemic, coral bleaching, was hardly noticeable, and hard coral cover increased across all three regions of the reef over the last year. A review of the environmental events that have occurred in the past 450 years indicates that Muga dhambi may have survived up to 80 major cyclones and centuries of exposure to invasive species, perhaps 100 coral bleaching events, low tides and human activity. The researchers report that Muga dhambi is in very good health with 70% consisting of live coral, the rest being covered with the green boring sponge, , turf algae, and green algae. “We found that about 30% of the colony was dead which is a completely natural and healthy occurrence as it supported the growth of turf algae, turtle weed, and sponge which all play important roles in the ecosystem,” said Cook. “This diversity of benthos meant that lots of fish were attracted to hide in the coral structure, feed off the turf algae and turn Muga dhambi into a thriving microecosystem.” “This field note provides important geospatial, environmental, and cultural information of a rare coral that can be monitored, appreciated, potentially restored and hopefully inspire future generations to care more for our reefs and culture,” write the authors",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/438-year-old-coral-discovered-in-the-great-barrier-reef/
"This year’s American James Dyson Award winner, Gabe Tavas, takes on deforestation with his invention, Pyrus. His mission is simple: Make wood without cutting down trees. By embracing a balance between nature and design, Gabe found a way to use bacterial cellulose—the main component of wood—to form an alternative material which imitates exotic woods found in the Amazon Rainforest. Gabe claims his ambition for creating global change came from what he calls the “immigrant influence.” His mother, now an immigration attorney, moved to the United States from Cuba as a small child and his father from the Philippines at age 17. “I began considering entrepreneurship as a teenager and felt an urgency around solving global issues in sustainability,” Gabe says. Born and raised in Chicago, Gabe yearned for more time spent in nature and found his escape at the Saint Paul Woods in Morton Grove, IL. “Growing up in the city, you don’t have many expressions of nature which can be stressful. Forests provide an escape. It’s my favorite place to meditate, and the thought of losing that because we were too short-sided pains me from a visceral level.” Every piece of wood has two essential ingredients: Cellulose, which provides its basic shape and framework, and Lignin, which acts as a glue for all the other components. Some kombucha companies use microorganisms that produce coherent sheets of cellulose on top of the liquid. To make Pyrus, these sheets of cellulose are blended to an even consistency and then embedded into a gel. As the gel dries, it hardens and is placed under a mechanical press to form a flat sheet of wood-like material. This material can then be sanded, cut, and coated with resins just like its tree-based counterparts. While there are several companies creating wood alternative materials, many are using sawdust. Utilizing sawdust still involves the cutting down of trees and damaging the natural ecosystem, but it also poses serious health risks to those overexposed to it. Sawdust is an irritant that can affect your eyes, nose, and throat, and in long-term exposures can even . With Pyrus, not a single tree is cut down and no dangerous oils are being used. Pyrus uses kombucha waste, which is both environmentally friendly and sustainably created, to create a cellulose making wood in a sustainable fashion. The end goal of Pyrus is to replace expensive and fancy wood products which are currently huge drivers of deforestation. Over the past year, Gabe has produced 74 Pyrus wood samples in a variety of colors and textures. Pyrus has been tested on several pieces of equipment commonly found in woodworking shops and makerspaces, all with the guidance and consistently positive feedback of professional woodworkers. Maintaining the versatility of wood, Pyrus can be made into jewelery, guitar picks, and coasters. Winning the national leg of the James Dyson Award will inject $2,600 into Gabe’s project. He plans to use the prize money to expand his production facilities and develop 3D printing processes. Ultimately, Gabe wants Pyrus to be made into various environmentally friendly products that meet consumer needs and are commercially viable. Three-time James Dyson Award judge and Technology Influencer Sam Sheffer had this to say about the award and this year’s winner: “I’ve judged the JDA for several years and am always captivated by the inventions these young engineers put forward. The 2021 entries were some of the most competitive I’ve seen. Pyrus stood out because it’s solving a problem we can all relate to with waste from a product that the majority of us consume every day. I’m excited to see all the innovative ways Pyrus will evolve under Gabe’s imaginative and talented leadership.” Pyrus will progress to the international stage of the James Dyson Award. The International shortlist will be announced on October 13 and the International winners on November 17.

"The Chesapeake Bay has, despite massive setbacks, continued to return to something resembling a healthy estuarine ecosystem, in no small part because of the dedicated scientists who study it. As the most extensively studied estuary on Earth, the Chesapeake’s 11,000 miles of coastline play host to a familiar story of competition between short-term economic interests, and long-term ecological ones. There may have been a time when the two most important species, oysters and seagrass, would have ceased to exist if pollution continued as it had done, but regulation reduced the dead-zones and brought fish, oysters, and seagrass . Now teams of scientists are working to speed the recovery of these keystone species, often by hand, reasoning that as ecosystem engineers, oysters and seagrass can begin to do the scientists’ work for them if they can only propagate to the required numbers. As the principal polluting agents were nutrient runoff from farms in the surrounding states, and pollutants flowing in from the cities, regulating storm drains and incentivizing farmers to reduce runoff resulted in a 316% increase in seagrass beds between 1984 and 2015. Oysters, too, are recovering through the diligent work of people like Romuald Lipcius, professor of fisheries science at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. He’s worked in the Bay for over 16 years—helping oysters recover, live longer, and perform more of their all-important filter feeding. Using fossil oyster shells, safe artificial substrate, or concrete Lipcius and his colleagues are creating safe and optimal habitat for them to grow, and are seeing three-dimensional oyster beds as a result. In Baines Creek, a tributary of the Elizabeth River in Virginia, oysters are reaching the age of five—once thought impossible due to the diseases that pollution made so commonplace in the Bay. “All these oysters peeking above the water is a beautiful sight,” Rowan Lockwood at William & Mary College “It is a glimpse of what the Bay was like 6,000 years ago.” In the Rappahannock River, also in Virginia, a retired Naval officer had used oyster castles to cultivate millions of oysters that regularly reached the age of seven. Between five and seven is when the fecundity of oysters is highest, and they release the most larva. Out in the Bay, his continued interest in restoring the oyster unveiled some “relict reefs” that had survived from pre-colonial times. “The relict reefs and artificial reefs are telling us without a doubt that oyster restoration can succeed,” says Lipcius. “I have always believed that we know how to restore the oysters; we are just choosing not to,” adds Lockwood. Oysters aren’t the only species that are getting a helping hand. In 2018, after the prolific rise of seagrass acreage in the Bay, record rainfall swept enormous quantities of sediment down off the surrounding farms. The nitrogen and phosphorus was lapped up by algae blooms which blocked the sun from reaching the seagrass, and as a result 38% of the eelgrass species was lost. “Seagrass is one of the key foundation habitats in the Chesapeake Bay, and in shallow coastal marine systems worldwide,” says Chris Patrick, also at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences. “It anchors the sediment, it clears the water, it allows small particles to drift down and become entrained.” Patrick and his team are looking to speed up the process of seagrass recovery by manually planting seagrass seeds, and harvesting the seed bearing shoots of two different species, eelgrass and widgeon grass, in May. Filtering the sediment out of the seeds, they take the finest quality seeds and plant them in autumn. Compared to last year, it’s Patrick’s estimate that his planting operations will result in four times as much grass next year. Patrick and Lipcius work hard for small gains, but fortunately for them the species they’re working to save are better at cleaning and protecting the Bay than even the most die-hard marine biologists, and for each blade of eelgrass or each happy oyster they add to the Chesapeake, they add one more dedicated worker to the project of restoring the Bay to its glorious and bountiful heritage.

"A young Irishman has come up with his own “cool science-y method” to solve the microplastic pollution conundrum, winning Google’s international science fair in the process. By mixing magnetized iron oxide and vegetable oil, he created a kind of liquid magnet that collects microplastics which can then be removed via magnetism, leaving only glistening water behind. There’s nothing like growing up in a pristine environment to galvanize a person to its defense, and a feature on young Fionn Ferreira from the south of Ireland details how since the age of 12, he has been looking to find a solution for the hard-to-clean microplastics he knew accompanied the growing amount of plastic garbage that tended to wash up on the beaches he frequented during childhood. “I was at our beach and I saw a rock and it had oil spill residue on it, and stuck to this oil spill residue were plastic particles,” says Fionn in a for the Plastic Soup Foundation. “I asked myself why is this happening, and I found out that plastic particles are what we call non-polar, and oil is non-polar too. In chemistry likes attract likes, which means non-polar things attract non-polar things.” He heard of something called ferrofluid, which was a kind of magnetic water by combining vegetable oil with magnetized iron oxide powder. In the same video presentation, he shows that oil attracted the microplastics, and the immersion of a magnet sucked up the lot. “I started out as a lonely inventor,” Ferreira told the . “After the Google Science Fair, I could all of a sudden speak to scientists—they gave me credit for what I had done. My idea was no longer a toy invented by a child.” Indeed after 5,000 tests it was shown that his method could clean 87%-93% of microplastics from the water, despite the fact that the microplastics came from a variety of sources like car tires, plastic bottles, and laundry water. He demonstrated his method at the 2019 Google Science Fair and won a $50,000 scholarship, which he used to go and study chemistry at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Fionn is now trying to fit his method into a device that can span the opening of a home waterpipe, or the pipes at a wastewater plant, allowing the ferrofluid to continuously clean water that moves through it, as well as a different machine that can be mounted on boats. “He observed and tackled a problem he saw locally which has vast global significance,” Larissa Kelly, Ferreira’s former science teacher at Schull Community College told the BBC. “His invention, based on very simple components, is groundbreaking. It has powerful potential to provide solutions that will contribute to the worldwide effort to remove microplastics from the environment.” ( the video for this story below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/fionn-ferreira-won-google-science-fair-2019-with-microplastic-cleaning-fluid/
"Singing lullabies can not only improve the health of premature babies during intensive care but can lift their anxious family too, according to new research. Gentle music therapy slows down the heart rate of prematurely delivered infants—and also helps them to feed and sleep better, say scientists. New research into live music helping new mothers and family members has shown rhythmic strings or humming helps with therapeutic or care procedures. While playing sad songs may seem to be the antithesis of what scared parents may need at a time when their baby is in the intensive care unit, medical staff have said the impact of these songs were positive. It is thought playing songs about death, heartbreak, or other difficult times helps parents process their feelings and a sign of life from outside the hospital, too. Taru Koivisto, a doctoral student at UniArts Helsinki, said she worked with other professional musicians in hospitals and saw the playing of live instruments helped both mother and baby with healing—physically and mentally. She said, “A moment of music can create an intimate atmosphere where the parents can forget about treatments, tubes, and machines and put their entire focus on their baby and truly see them. “For the parents, music was a sign of life from outside of the hospital and helped them understand that life will carry on even in hard times,” Koivisto says. When a family’s premature infant goes into intensive care, their life may be changed permanently. Ms Koivisto added, “Music moments were described as a break that allowed the whole family to metaphorically travel to another space or place. “A shared musical journey together may have helped the family members create a new narrative for their life. “In one of the example situations, a mother of a baby asked her own mother, the grandmother of the baby, whether the song she chose was too emotional for her. “The grandmother said ‘no’. When they sang the song together, the grandmother started crying, but the mother of the child was content in her own way.” Other live therapeutic studies have shown gentle music therapy like singing lullabies can influence cardiac and respiratory function in newborns. Previous research found babies who receive this kind of therapy leave the hospital sooner. The findings were published in the journal",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/singing-lullabies-not-only-improves-the-health-of-premature-babies/
"Even a T-bone steak could not have persuaded this determined dog to move a muscle. The family pet named River was adopted from a shelter, so her breed is a mystery. It is believed, however, that she is part Australian Shepherd—and may be part border collie—so it’s not surprising that she is craftier than the average pup. When it gets late and bedtime is approaching, River gets her instruction to go out for her nightly toilet duties. Normally, she doesn’t mind and trots obediently out the door to visit the grass and trees on the property, and returns a few minutes later to settle in for the night. But she doesn’t like the rain at all, and on this night she devised a scheme to avoid going out into the weather. When she’s told to go outside, she rolled over on her back and pretended to be dead, or sleeping, or in a coma—but lying completely still. River wouldn’t budge for anything. : Her owner even tried flattery, but in the end, he just shoved her across the shiny floor towards the door, to her dismay. the video for a guaranteed chuckle, as River feigns paralysis to avoid going out in the rain…",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/dog-fakes-coma-to-avoid-going-outside/
"More than half of moms use snack time to show off what a “cool” mom they are, a new poll finds. The recent survey asked 2,000 American moms with children ages 3–18 to identify the traits of a “cool” mom—and then asked their kids to set the record straight. Nearly three in five kids agreed that a “cool” mom helps them out with homework and projects for school. And, according to kids, there are some things a “cool” mom should never do. Using their home nickname in front of their friends (42%), shouting their name at a sports game or other event (40%), and dancing in public (40%), will put some parents in time-out. Conducted by OnePoll in partnership with , the survey suggests that although getting kids to eat healthy food can be a challenge, moms have a few tricks up their sleeves, such as cutting up fruits and vegetables into fun shapes (48%) and making their food more colorful (47%). 47% of moms worry about whether their kids think they’re cool, and making food fun is one of their top creative ploys to win kids over. Half of moms have made a cheese board for their children, and more than half admitted that their youngsters eat more sophisticated snacks and lunches than they do. Moms also shared the secrets behind their greatest ever snack hacks, including blending frozen fruit so kids think it’s ice cream, building a stackable tower with sticks of watermelon and even making sandwich kabobs. Snacks and lunches can be a bragging point for kids, too—especially those that include chips (50%), baked goods (44%) or a fruit bowls (44%). : “Our study shows that many moms are good at navigating that balance between giving kids the foods they enjoy and making sure they’re getting a balanced diet,” said a spokesperson for SUNSET. “They’re introducing their youngsters to fruits and veggies in creative ways and incorporating them not just at lunchtime, but throughout the day as well.” And it can be a great opportunity for parents and kids to bond. Take a look at some of these cool-mom tips… • Kiwi caterpillars • Blending frozen fruit so they think it’s ice cream • Freezing bone broth in small cubes for winter soups or drinks • Making grab bags that they can’t see inside of and letting them choose their own bags, so every snack is a surprise • Sandwich kabobs • Making squash look and taste almost like mac n’ cheese to trick her into eating a veggie she doesn’t like • Jello with fruit mixed in and then poured into cool molds in different kinds of shapes like cars, houses, bears, etc. • Making pumpkin pancakes with beets and other pureed vegetables, but with fun colors • Building a Jenga stack with watermelon • Playing ‘restaurant’ during lunch – using menus so they can choose • Saying something is a ‘grown-up version’ so they want it, or something ‘new’ they get excited to try :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/snack-time-hacks-make-you-a-cool-mom/
"Clinical trials of a new precision, or functional medicine approach to targeting and reversing cognitive decline from Alzheimer’s has produced “unprecedented” and “far-reaching” results. Called the MEND (metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration) Protocol, it’s based on the oft-ignored, though universally understood preference, going all the way back to Hippocrates, for treating the cause—not the symptom—of a disease. Developed by , an internationally renowned expert in neurodegenerative disease, it works to fix and fortify the underlying biochemical profile that gives rise to Alzheimer’s, rather than simply targeting, as pharmaceutical companies have tried to do, the tau protein called beta-amyloid that brings about the hallmarks of the disease. Neuroscientists have firmly established as the only natural defense mechanism we have to protect our brain from the toxic beta-amyloid proteins that cause Alzheimer’s, but Bredesen has now shown in a series of human clinical trials that there is a panoply of conditions that must be met in order for a human to develop Alzheimer’s, and that if these conditions are corrected, even in the elderly, dementia can be reversed. In the Dr. Bredesen explained that 10 patients with mild or subjective-cognitive impairment—what Bredesen describes as essentially the first two of a four-stage disease—underwent 5-24 weeks of the MEND Protocol. “The therapeutic approach used was programmatic and personalized,” writes Bredesen. “Patients who had had to discontinue work were able to return to work, and those struggling at work were able to improve their performance. The patients, their spouses, and their co-workers all reported clear improvements.” The time for science jargon must end, Bredesen stressed in a recent interview on , because for patients struggling with Alzheimer’s, and for their families, it is a tragedy that can’t be adequately summarized in the language of a peer-reviewed paper. Anecdotal evidence may be enough to warrant action. One of the ten patients, aged 69, was advised that, given his status as an Alzheimer’s disease patient and his clear decline, he should begin to “get his affairs in order.” His business was in the process of being shut down due to his inability to continue work. He began on the MEND therapeutic program, and after six months, he and his wife and co-workers all noted the improvement. He was able to recognize faces at work unlike before, was able to remember his daily schedule, and was able to function at work without difficulty. He was also noted to be quicker with his responses. His lifelong ability to add columns of numbers rapidly in his head, which he had lost during his progressive cognitive decline, returned. His wife pointed out that, although he had clearly shown improvement, the more striking effect was that he had been accelerating in his decline over the prior year or two, and this had been completely halted. MEND case studies were complied detailing people recovering from the neurodegeneration—not slowing, or stopping their cognitive decline, but of altogether reversing it. The 2018 case study is filled with small notations that highlight the significance to the patient and their family. “Driver’s license returned…follows recipes again…speaking, dressing, dancing, biking, emailing, kayaking all returned…conversing again, dressing himself, calling grandchildren by name, working again.” One nurse asked, “What happened?!” From this method came the “Bredesen Protocol,” which recently produced the first clinical trial in history that involved a pre-examination for all the underlying factors that contribute to Alzheimer’s, before setting patients on a personalized, precision medicine approach. Released on a pre-print server for studies awaiting peer-review, that what we call Alzheimer’s is a network dysfunction resulting from decades of assaults upon our physiology by the environment. Toxins like heavy metals, black mold, and air particulates, metabolites and biological detritus like the beta-amyloid targeted by dementia drugs, a lack of neuro-fortification arising from a sedentary lifestyle of the body and mind—all of these contribute to the conditions that give rise to neurodegeneration. Logically it would follow that correcting this dysfunction would be the first step to targeting Alzheimer’s. And, that is exactly what happened in all 25 of the patients in the study, when they were assisted in addressing all 36 underlying biological dimensions in the Protocol. While this is merely a news report, and is not to be construed as medical advice, those interested in the Bredesen Protocol .

"“’Till death do us part,” obviously doesn’t translate into ancient Mandarin, if this archaeological discovery in China is any indication. The skeletal remains of a couple locked in a tender embrace bears witness to the fact that in the Northern Wei Period of 4th century China, the expectation of love was that it went, quite literally, beyond the grave. The lovers lay on their side, arms wrapped around each other’s waist, with the woman’s cheek nestled in the crook of the man’s shoulder. Barring any phenomenal circumstances, archaeologists believe that the two were placed into their gravesite in this manner, reflecting “the desire for eternal love of the couple, and the respect to their love by people who buried them”. As the reports, the scene might conjure the end of the tragic tale of . With obvious signs of trauma across the male’s body, including an unhealed wound on his right arm, and a wound-less female skeleton, the archaeologists suggest the possibility that she ended her own life in a kind of sacrifice in order to be with her lover in the afterlife. The discovery was made as part of an excavation that unearthed a cemetery in the city of Dadong, and the orientation of the grave suggests it was used by commoners. : Another striking detail was the presence of a silver ring on the female’s finger—but the researchers don’t believe it had anything to do with marriage. They think it was simply the cultures’ tendencies to think of “bringing things” with them, into the afterlife. The lack of gems or engravings meant “it probably didn’t cost very much.” This Northern Wei period in an abrasive relationship, like sandpaper, with the many nomadic tribes on their borders. The nomads, in this case the Tuobo People, conquered Shanxi, in the Taiyuan Province. Subsequent rulers cultivated Buddhism as a strong central faith, bringing a more concrete concept of the afterlife to the people. : “This funerary practice might have been influenced by the customs from the Western Regions and beyond through the Silk Roads,” write the authors in their corresponding on the discovery. “This discovery is a unique display of the human emotion of love in a burial, offering a rare glimpse of concepts of love, life, death and the afterlife in northern China during a time of intense cultural and ethnic exchange,” said co-author Qu Zhang.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/skeletons-in-china-found-locked-in-loving-embrace-in-the-same-grave/
"This artist creates intricate sculptures of animals made completely out of trash including plastic spoons, old ping pong balls, and even unused catheters. 35-year-old Stephanie Hongo embraced trash art four years ago because at the time she could not afford art supplies. Now Stephanie, who lives in Connecticut, has created over 100 detailed artworks of animals, sometimes screwing together hundreds of pieces of trash for one piece. Stephanie appeals to friends and family for spare trash and also sources specific pieces from Facebook groups to complete her incredible sculptures of lobsters, octopus, and other animals. She has used a Barbie leg to create a unicorn’s horn, unused catheters as the antennas of a lobster, and plastic forks for the feathers of an owl. Stephanie, who creates her art under the name Sugarfox, explained that she turned to trash to make her artworks as she was strapped for cash after quitting her job as an artist-in-residence at grocery store chain Trader Joe’s in May 2017. She was inspired by Portuguese artist Bordalo II, who makes large scale installations out of trash. She made a rule that she will never purchase plastics for her sculptures. “I won’t ever purchase plastic, I don’t like the idea of buying anything outside the paint and the hardware that I need,” She said. “I do ask for plastic tubing or old basketballs on community pages on Facebook. Despite using recycled materials, Stephanie resists the label of ‘eco artist’ as she uses spray paint to complete her pieces. “I do find it necessary to tell people that I’m not an eco artist. The recycling aspect of my art is something I’m very proud of but it’s not the driving force behind it. The animal kingdom is Stephanie’s favorite subject and she likes how nailing trash together gives the works a sci-fi, steampunk look. She spends between ten hours and two weeks on each piece and has developed a knack for finding the perfect piece of trash to build her artworks. “Some pieces need hundreds of pieces of trash. “Ping pong balls are very commonly used in my art as well as a lot of extension cords, old telephones, old remote controls, and lots of plastic toys.” Stephanie, who shows off her artworks on her Instagram , said that her artworks start at $300 with her eight-foot long octopus going for $5,000. She hopes to one day sculpt a winged dragon measuring ten feet.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/animal-sculptures-trash-art-stephanie-hongo/
"Our partner Rob Brezsny provides his weekly wisdom to enlighten our thinking and motivate our mood. Rob’s , is a syndicated weekly column appearing in over a hundred publications. He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): “I sing like the nightingale whose melody is crowded in the too narrow passage of her throat,” wrote author Virginia Woolf. That was an insulting curse for her to fling at herself. I disapprove of such behavior—especially for you in the coming weeks. If you hope to be in alignment with cosmic rhythms, don’t you dare say nasty things about yourself, even in the privacy of your own thoughts. In fact, please focus on the exact opposite: flinging praise and appreciation and compliments at yourself. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): The Tumblr blogger wlw says the following are the top tender actions. 1. Fastening clothes or jewelry for your companion. 2. Letting them rest their head on your shoulder. 3. Idly playing with their hands. 4. Brushing a leaf out of their hair. 5. Locking pinkies. 6. Rubbing their back when you embrace. 7. Both of you wearing an item that belongs to the other. Dear Libra, I hope you will employ these tender actions with greater frequency than usual in the coming weeks, Libra. Why? In my astrological opinion, it’s a ripe time to boost your Affection Quotient with the allies you care for the most. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Naturalist wrote in his journal, “I feel slightly complimented when nature condescends to make use of me without my knowledge—as when I help scatter her seeds in my walk—or carry burs and cockles on my clothes from field to field. I feel as though I had done something for the commonweal.” I mention this, Scorpio, because the coming weeks will be an excellent time for you to carry out good deeds and helpful transformations in nature’s behalf. Your ability to collaborate benevolently with plants and animals and elemental forces will be at a peak. So will your knack for creating interesting connections between yourself and all wild things. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): You may have never heard of Sagittarian artist Baya Mahieddine (1931–1998). At age 16, she experienced a splash of acclaim with a show in Paris. Famous artists Pablo Picasso, Henry Matisse, and George Braques came. They drew inspiration from Mahieddine’s innovative use of color, elements from her Algerian heritage, and her dream-like images. Picasso even invited her to work with him, exulting in the fresh perspectives she ignited. Though her art never received the full credit it warranted,  astrological omens are authorizing you to go out and get the recognition and appreciation you deserve but have not yet fully received. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): “Who knows what is unfolding on the other side of each hour?” asked Capricorn poet Juan Ramón Jiménez (translated by Capricorn poet Robert Bly). “How many times the sunrise was there, behind a mountain. How many times the brilliant cloud piling up far off was already a golden body full of thunder!” Your assignment, Capricorn, is to imagine what is unfolding just beyond your perception and understanding. But here’s the twist: You must steer your mind away from inclinations to indulge in fear. You must imagine that the events in the works are beautiful, interesting, or redemptive. If you’re not willing to do that, skip the exercise altogether. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): “Better than any argument is to rise at dawn and pick dew-wet red berries in a cup,” wrote author Wendell Berry. I mostly agree with that sentiment, although I will also put in a good word for certain kinds of arguments. There are moments when it’s crucial for your psychological and spiritual health that you initiate a conversation about delicate issues that might lead to a dispute. However, I don’t think this is one of those times, Aquarius. In my astrological opinion, picking dew-wet red berries is far more sensible than any argument. For further inspiration, read this testimony from actor : “I definitely would rather take a nap than get angry.” PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): For painter , love wasn’t primarily a sentimental feeling. Nor was it an unfocused generalized wish for health and happiness in those he cared for. Rather, he wrote, “You must love with a high, serious, intimate sympathy, with a will, with intelligence.” His love was alert, acute, active, and energized. It was animated with a determination to be resourceful and ingenious in nurturing the beloved. For van Gogh, love was always in action, forever moving toward ever-fresh engagement. In service to intimacy, he said, “you must always seek to know more thoroughly, better, and more.” I hope you’ll make these meditations a top priority during the next seven weeks. ARIES (March 21-April 19): Aries mythologist advised us to love our fate. He said we should tell ourselves, “Whatever my fate is, this is what I need.” Even if an event seems inconvenient or disruptive, we treat it as an opportunity, as an interesting challenge. “If you bring love to that moment, not discouragement,” Campbell said, “you will find the strength.” He concludes that any detour or disarray you can learn from “is an improvement in your character, your stature, and your life. What a privilege!” Few signs of the zodiac are inclined to enthusiastically adopt such an approach, but you Aries folks are most likely to do so. Now is an especially favorable time to use it. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): The brilliant Taurus dancer and choreographer spoke of “a vitality, a life force, a quickening that is translated through you into action,” adding that “there is only one of you in all time.” She added, “It is not your business to determine how good it is, nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open.” But even if you do this very well, Graham said, you will nevertheless always feel “a divine dissatisfaction, a blessed unrest” that will fuel you. This is the perfect message for you Tauruses to embrace in the coming weeks. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): There’s growing scientific evidence that we make ourselves stupid by complaining too much—or even by listening to other people complain a lot. Excessive negative thoughts drain energy from our hippocampus, a part of our brain that’s essential to problem-solving. This doesn’t mean, of course, that we should avoid dealing with difficult issues. But it does suggest we should be discerning about how many disturbing and depressing ideas we entertain. According to my reading of the omens, all this will be especially useful advice for you in the coming weeks. CANCER (June 21-July 22): Your brain contains one hundred billion nerve cells. Each cell has the potential to be linked with tens of thousands of others. And they are always busy. Typically, your grey matter makes a million new connections every second. But I suspect your number of connections will increase even beyond that in the coming weeks. Your most complex organ will be working with greater intensity than usual. Will that be a bad thing or a good thing? It depends on whether you formulate an intention to channel your intelligence into wise analysis about important matters—and not waste it in careless fussing about trivial details. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): “You should have a sticky soul,” counsels author Elizabeth Berg. “The act of continually taking things in should be as much a part of you as your hair color.” I especially endorse that attitude for you during the next four weeks, Leo. Your task is to make yourself extra magnetic for all the perceptions, experiences, ideas, connections, and resources you need most. By September 23, I suspect you will have gained an infusion of extra ballast and gravitas.

"While in America off-grid solar electricity is still fairly uncommon, around the world it gives power to 420 million people. Furthermore, it’s created an entirely unlooked-for market worth more than $1 billion annually. It’s unlooked-for because—as the first and even second generations of solar panels are nearing the end of their lifecycle—renewable energy pioneers and advocates are hurrying to try and come up with ways to prevent them from inundating landfills with millions of tons of electronic waste. The International Renewable Energy Agency that, by 2050, there will be only slightly more new panels installed per year than there will be panels being decommissioned—and they are predicted to grow to 6% of global electronic waste streams. The solution to the problem of growing solar waste, is perhaps seeing that a degraded solar panel just needs a slight fix to make it nearly as good as new. Since 2017, revenues from the off-grid solar industry continue to rapidly grow, increasing by 30% annually, , who add that 180 million off-grid solar panels were sold to people in countries including Nigeria, Pakistan, and Lebanon. In nations such as these, reliable power for those outside the major cities is hardly the norm. Poor infrastructure and limited investment currently restricts electricity access to about one-ninth of the world’s population. While perhaps not good enough to maintain government or industry-imposed standards for power generation at a Google campus, decommissioned solar panels are often just fine for meeting the needs of powering a house, or a water pump, or something equally small. A little opinion piece in remarking on these recent reports noted that second-hand market shipments of retired solar panels in the several thousands are quite the normal. In the Southern Hemisphere, merely an $11 billion investment at current market conditions would be needed to expand the second-hand solar trade to every unpowered inhabitant. “The off-grid solar industry is instrumental for achieving universal electricity access,” said Riccardo Puliti of the report, the Regional Director of Infrastructure, Africa, at the World Bank. “We are scaling up our support to client countries by helping them leverage this potential through innovative and financially sustainable solutions.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-second-hand-market-for-solar-panels-could-be-a-market-solution-for-power-access/
"Gen Z and millennial Americans are “cashing in” on lost time due to the pandemic and applying new financial lessons from these life-changing years, according to a new survey. The new poll asked 2,000 Gen Z and millennial Americans (born in the years 1981-2003) and asked about their new spending and saving habits during the ongoing impact of the pandemic. The results found that nearly seven in 10 (69%) are getting back to spending money on things they missed because of COVID-19. And, 75% are focusing their spending on activities that allow them to catch up with friends and family. When lifted restrictions and re-openings began in early summer, Gen-Z and millennials took advantage, with 51% of respondents splurging on a trip away, while 49% have been spending money on drinks and dinners at bars and restaurants. Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of , a digital banking platform of KeyBank, the survey also found that 58% created new savings goals because their spending habits have changed. Six in 10 respondents agreed they’re more financially confident than they were before the pandemic and they credit their need to be more financially responsible to COVID-19. It’s translated to a shift in how Gen Z and millennial Americans manage their personal finances, as just over 30% admit they’re budgeting for the first time, while a further 39% are using new methods, like apps or dedicated spreadsheets to keep track of their budget. The survey found that 61% of respondents managed to save at least $1,000 from the start of the pandemic through the start of summer 2021 and one in 10 saved over $5,000. With those new savings, Gen-Z and millennials say they’ll put that towards paying off their student loans (38%), spend it on a vacation (37%), pay their rent (32%) and make payments on their credit cards (29%). “It’s encouraging to see that young Americans are feeling more financially confident throughout what continues to be a very difficult and challenging time, and that so many are focused on maintaining their hard-earned savings,” said Alyssa Schaefer, Chief Experience Officer at Laurel Road. The survey found that 77% of those with private loans now feel prepared to start paying again, compared to 62% who have federal student loans. Respondents’ confidence in their ability to save remains high, with two-thirds (66%) noting they believe they can achieve their savings goals moving forward. In fact, this is top of mind for many, as over one in five (22%) of those surveyed noted that if they had an extra $1,000 to spend for the rest of 2021 they would put it in their savings account. 1.

"Dark energy, the mysterious force that causes the universe to accelerate, may have been responsible for unexpected results from the XENON1T experiment, deep below Italy’s Apennine Mountains. A new study, led by researchers at the University of Cambridge and reported in the journal , suggests that some unexplained results from the XENON1T experiment in Italy may have been caused by dark energy, and not the dark matter the experiment was designed to detect. They constructed a physical model to help explain the results, which may have originated from dark energy particles produced in a region of the Sun with strong magnetic fields, although future experiments will be required to confirm this explanation. The researchers say their study could be an important step toward the direct detection of dark energy. Everything our eyes can see in the skies and in our everyday world – from tiny moons to massive galaxies, from ants to blue whales—makes up less than five percent of the universe. The rest is dark. About 27% is dark matter—the invisible force holding galaxies and the cosmic web together – while 68% is dark energy, which causes the universe to expand at an accelerated rate. “Despite both components being invisible, we know a lot more about dark matter, since its existence was suggested as early as the 1920s, while dark energy wasn’t discovered until 1998,” said Dr Sunny Vagnozzi from Cambridge’s Kavli Institute for Cosmology, the paper’s first author. “Large-scale experiments like XENON1T have been designed to directly detect dark matter, by searching for signs of dark matter ‘hitting’ ordinary matter, but dark energy is even more elusive.” To detect dark energy, scientists generally look for gravitational interactions: the way gravity pulls objects around. And on the largest scales, the gravitational effect of dark energy is repulsive, pulling things away from each other and making the universe’s expansion accelerate. About a year ago, the XENON1T experiment reported an unexpected signal, or excess, over the expected background. “These sorts of excesses are often flukes, but once in a while they can also lead to fundamental discoveries,” said co-author Dr Luca Visinelli, from Frascati National Laboratories in Italy. “We explored a model in which this signal could be attributable to dark energy, rather than the dark matter the experiment was originally devised to detect.” At the time, the most popular explanation for the excess were axions—hypothetical, extremely light particles—produced in the Sun. However, this explanation does not stand up to observations, since the amount of axions that would be required to explain the XENON1T signal would drastically alter the evolution of stars much heavier than the Sun, in conflict with what we observe. We are far from fully understanding what dark energy is, but most physical models for dark energy would lead to the existence of a so-called fifth force. There are four fundamental forces in the universe, and anything that can’t be explained by one of these forces is sometimes referred to as the result of an unknown fifth force. However, we know that Einstein’s theory of gravity works extremely well in the local universe. Therefore, any fifth force associated to dark energy is unwanted and must be hidden, or screened, when it comes to small scales, and can only operate on the largest scales where Einstein’s theory of gravity fails to explain the acceleration of the Universe. To hide the fifth force, many models for dark energy are equipped with so-called screening mechanisms, which dynamically hide the fifth force. Vagnozzi and his co-authors constructed a physical model, which used a type of screening mechanism known as chameleon screening, to show that dark energy particles produced in the Sun’s strong magnetic fields could explain the XENON1T excess. “Our chameleon screening shuts down the production of dark energy particles in very dense objects, avoiding the problems faced by solar axions,” said Vagnozzi. “It also allows us to decouple what happens in the local very dense Universe from what happens on the largest scales, where the density is extremely low.” The researchers used their model to show what would happen in the detector if the dark energy was produced in a region of the Sun called the tachocline, where the magnetic fields are particularly strong. “It was really surprising that this excess could in principle have been caused by dark energy rather than dark matter,” said . “When things click together like that, it’s really special.” Their calculations suggest that experiments like XENON1T, which are designed to detect dark matter, could also be used to detect dark energy. However, the original excess still needs to be convincingly confirmed. “We first need to know that this wasn’t simply a fluke,” said Visinelli. “If XENON1T actually saw something, you’d expect to see a similar excess again in future experiments, but this time with a much stronger signal.” If the excess was the result of dark energy, upcoming upgrades to the XENON1T experiment, as well as experiments pursuing similar goals such as LUX-Zeplin and PandaX-xT, mean that it could be possible to directly detect dark energy within the next decade.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/dark-energy-cambridge-scientists-research/

Indeed, the IRF has invested $20 million worldwide into rhino conservation projects over the last 10 years, and in many countries their work is paying off. The largest success has no doubt come by way of the greater one-horned rhino. Native to India and Nepal, during the early 1900s there were a mere 100 individuals left. Today there are 3,700 and ever increasing in number. Over the last eight years, poaching incidents have fallen from 41 in 2013, to just 1 at present day. In the Indian state of Assam, rhinos can be found in four protected areas, and this year the population in the magnificent Manas National Park on the border with Nepal had reached 47 individuals having only been established with 4 just a few years ago. : Nepal also saw an increase of 107 greater one-horned rhinos in their country. Javan rhinos in Indonesia welcomed four new calves into the world, increasing the critically-endangered species to 75, greatly offsetting the rate of natural death. This is almost double the number of Javan rhinos from 2011. In Africa, the black rhino has seen an encouraging population increase of 16-17% over the past decade, while South Africa’s “Rhino court” established to hear exclusively poaching cases was reopened in April of this year, giving rangers the opportunity to testify against suspects without expensive travel to a major city, and without poaching cases falling into a court backlog. : In Zimbabwe, black rhino were reintroduced after a 30-year absence and are growing steadily, while in Kenya, anti-poaching efforts have dropped the number of rhinos killed to 0 this year, down from a high of 59 in 2013. “We must act today, to ensure these marvelous creatures can thrive for future generations,” Nina Fascione, executive director of IRF. “Let’s continue to build on our successes of greater one-horned, black, and Javan rhinos and reverse the declines for Sumatran and white rhinos, working together so rhinos can continue to thrive on Earth.” :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/african-and-indonesian-rhinos-grow-in-number-despite-pandemic-challenges/
"After the peninsula on Howth’s Head caught fire last year, pouring clouds of black smoke over the financial district of Ireland’s fair capital, city planners knew they needed to take a sterner stance on out-of-control weeds. So they hired a crack team of landscapers led by a dedicated forewoman to manage the weeds after quickly began to grow back over the firebreaks that had been dug. The Old Irish Goat is, amazingly, not the name of a pub, but a critically endangered species that was Ireland’s naturally-adapted breed, which had not been present in these hills in over a century. It is their ceaseless munching of local species that make them ideal for the job of de-weeding, and for the next three years in their new home their appetites will become the ultimate fire brigade. Because the goat had been bred out of existence in captivity, and only roams remote hillsides in small numbers, an organization called the has been dedicated to keeping their DNA free from domestic goat genetics and happily supplied a small herd of 25 to take over as Howth’s Head new ‘firefighters’. The Old Irish Goat with short legs, large horns, a thick coat, and small ears worn in the pricked position. They’re perfectly adapted to life on the Irish hills. “Our goats come from the mountains and eat whatever’s there, scrub, heather, gorse. They’re the most suitable for this task,” the Old Irish Goat Society’s chair, Pádraic Browne, told The . “We’re giving our beautiful little creatures a job to do, which they’re doing. They’re not just a tourist attraction, they can earn their keep.” Currently the firefighters consist of 14 nannies and 11 kids, to be added to with adult males until it grows to about 100 goats—a necessary reinforcement as the strength of Irish wildfires on Howth and elsewhere have been growing over recent years. As strange as it may seem in a country as seemingly wet and cloudy as Ireland to have multiple firefighter units for a single city, the unique solution gives the chance for a largely forgotten piece of wild natural heritage to raise awareness of the fascinating breed on its own behalf. a video about these beautiful goats…",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-old-irish-goat-controls-wildfires-on-howths-head-ireland/

"Noted researchers are coming together on September 10 to spread one message: “Self-compassion is critical.” The will feature a deep dive into self-compassion with Kristin Neff, PhD, the pioneering self-compassion researcher who conducted the first empirical studies on self-compassion over 20 years ago. Her latest book is The free event has been organized by the , which wants to focus us inward. “It is not just the external systems that require compassionate care, it is each and every one of us who can benefit from the inner work of self-compassion to rest, restore, and return to wholeness.” The gathering will be co-hosted by the Center’s founder Laura Berland,  and Monica Worline, PhD, co-author of and researcher with the Stanford University Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education. Berland points out that self-compassion is often an overlooked concept. “Self-compassion is the foundation for our internal growth, a greater capacity for compassion with others, and creating the compassionate world where everyone thrives.” “Especially during these chaotic times, the call to compassionate action is more urgent than ever,” she added : Worline and Neff, an Associate Professor of Educational Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, will share their latest research and insights on self-compassion.

"Jeff Bezos has placed an additional $1 billion into the Bezos Earth Fund to be spent on creating, expanding, managing, and monitoring protected and conserved areas of wilderness. The money will take the form of grants to organizations working to preserve lands and secure Indigenous people’s rights in the Congo, tropical Andes Mountains, and across Oceania. The latest pledge is on top of the ten-thousand millions he’s already devoted towards combating climate change more directly, with nearly one-thousand of those millions having already been distributed as grants. “When people hanker for the good old days and glamorize the past, they’re almost always wrong. By most metrics, life is better than it was in the past,” Bezos said in a statement. “But there is a notable exception—the natural world is not better today than it was 500 years ago, when we enjoyed unspoiled forests, clean rivers, and the pristine air of the pre-industrial age.” The first round of grant money went mostly to large, well-organized global conservation names like the WWF. However the Amazon founder isn’t just throwing money around. Unsurprisingly, the man who transformed global e-commerce has a larger plan. Research that if governments simply recognized all existing Indigenous land claims, it would be the single largest conservation victory since the invention of the national park. The regions is looking to preserve are, to use the parlance of a famous television conservationist, “chock-a-block” with Indigenous groups. “Conservation is one of the most effective anti-poverty strategies we have,” United Nations Deputy Secretary-General I warmly welcome this generous commitment, which will help deliver the Sustainable Development Goals.” : “We can and must reverse this anomaly,” Bezos added. “By coming together with the right focus and ingenuity, we can have both the benefits of our modern lives and a thriving natural world.

"Expert firefighting, contingency planning, and gallons upon gallons of water mean that the stands of giant sequoia trees in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains appear to be safe for future generations. The September 9th “Windy Fire,” started by a lighting strike, burned 25,000 acres in Peyrone Sequoia Grove and the Red Hill Grove before it converged on Sequoia National Park. There, firefighters wrapped many of the famous trees such as “General Sherman” the largest tree on Earth by volume, in fire-resistant foil capable of withstanding 1,200°F. “The fortunate thing is the Park Service has done a lot of prescribed burning in [the park] since the 1960s, and so it’s making their job a lot easier,” Jon Wallace, a chief firefighter said . “There’s also a myriad of walking trails in there, which have given firefighters places to work off of,” he added. “The structures in the Giant Forest, the museum, all the infrastructure around the General Sherman tree, that’s all got sprinklers on it, and firefighters are running those sprinklers pretty much nonstop to make sure everything stays wet. But right now, all the protection efforts in the Giant Forest are going really well,” he said. A trip to Sequoia National Park teaches one that the giant conifers actually withstand fires very well, and many of those whose count of years stretch into the thousands would have endured many fires. Their bark, like a giant spongy blanket, can be 32-inches thick, and protects them from the flames. The trees actually need levels of heat which only a fire can generate to release the seeds stored in their cones. In practice then, sequoias are literally born in flames. However with year after year of California drought conditions mixed with predictions that weather events like fires will become more severe with climate change, it pays to be safe, and , more than 600 firefighters were battling the blaze at one point, most of them working within the Trail of 100 Giants grove.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/firefighters-wrap-fire-resistant-foil-around-sequoias-as-wildfire-is-brought-under-control/
"An endangered turtle that washed up in Ireland with hypothermia has been returned to its native Canary Islands on a flight—and even had its own boarding pass. The three-year-old Loggerhead sea turtle, known as Julius Caesar or ‘JC’, was discovered on the beach in County Donegal, but has boarded a flight to much warmer waters. Airline Aer Lingus teamed up with Exploris Aquarium, where the the reptile has been living for the last three years, to fly him to Gran Canaria for his release. Aer Lingus pilot, Captain Peter Lumsden, said: “It is our pleasure to welcome aboard a very special passenger today and to ensure the safe transportation of JC the Turtle to Gran Canaria. “Since they first got in contact, Aer Lingus has worked closely with the team from Exploris Aquarium and our Maintenance & Engineering and Ground Operations teams to ensure that all JC’s needs are met as we complete this important mission. Keeping the turtle’s temperature above 19 degrees is critical to his wellbeing and he requires regular monitoring and shell lubrication so placing him in the aircraft hold was not an option. His specially designed crate was securely strapped across a number of seats in the cabin. In January 2019, weighing a few hundred grams, nine-month-old JC is thought to have gotten caught up in the wrong current and swept along the Gulf Stream. Loggerhead turtles are endangered and are happiest in warmer climates, so the chilly waters of the North Atlantic put JC’s life in danger. Fortunately, he was discovered by a local family and taken to Exploris Aquarium in Portaferry, County Down, to recuperate in a tropical tank with tasty snacks of fish mixture and squid. The pandemic prevented him from his repatriation for three years, however on September 15 the now-25kg reptile was packed into a waterproof crate and boarded flight EI 782 from Dublin to Gran Canaria. He was accompanied by his minder Portia Sampson, who ensured he was safely passed over to the Centro de Recuperación de Fauna Silvestrede Tarifa on arrival. Less than 24 hours later, JC became fully acclimatized to his new home and was released back into the sea. Aer Lingus previously transported another rogue loggerhead turtle, Leona, to Las Palmas, Gran Canaria in December 2014 after she was discovered in County Clare. Loggerhead turtles are a vulnerable and endangered species and their numbers are in decline in the wild. According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) they are “the living representatives of a group of reptiles that has existed on Earth and traveled our seas for the last 100 million years.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/endangered-turtle-joins-flight-from-ireland-to-native-canary-islands/
"When you see a homeless person on the street, do you ignore them? Hand them some spare change? Direct them to the nearest social service center? One Canadian woman went even further than that. At the time, she may not have realized the profound impact her simple act of kindness might have, but her compassion has had life-changing repercussions. Kim Cormier was working outside her Kingston, Ontario home when David McDonald’s scooter blew a tire. Even though he was a stranger, she agreed to keep an eye on his stuff so it wouldn’t get stolen while he went to fetch a new inner-tube. When McDonald got back from his errand, not only were his things still there, Cormier invited him in for supper. Over the meal, McDonald, Cormier, and her partner Andrew Embury fell into an easy—if unexpected—camaraderie that was the start of what’s become a beautiful friendship. For McDonald, the road to homelessness began in 2010 when he suffered a series of personal and financial reverses. The gas station he owned went under. Soon after, his truck and his home followed. Then he and his long-term partner broke up. By 2016, McDonald was homeless and living in a Toronto park. “I couldn’t imagine being homeless. I cried,” McDonald told . “And so it was hard for me to accept help… charity.” While McDonald does receive a financial stipend from the government, he declined homeless services because he says “other people are worse off” than him and needed them more. From that Toronto park, McDonald bounced around, staying with relatives when he could, finally ending up in a one-bedroom shared apartment. But faced with daily dangers of theft and threats of violence, he found himself back on the streets—dividing his days between a tent and a derelict transportation trailer. In the ensuing months, McDonald and Cormier stayed in touch. She and her partner began helping McDonald out with donations of clothing, shoes, and a solar-powered backpack that enabled him to keep his cell phone charged. Eventually, the couple told McDonald he was welcome to set up quarters in their backyard. Thanks to a sister, McDonald got a new tent equipped with a mattress, couch, and a refrigerator. An outdoor fireplace has been serving as McDonald’s impromptu kitchen and he’s been given restroom and laundry privileges inside the house. But since the tent was only suited for three seasons, Cormier came up with a plan to provide McDonald with a more permanent shelter to keep him warm in the winter as well. With a goal of $18,000, Cormier launched an online fundraiser to buy McDonald his own tiny house. “We are trying to raise as much money as possible to help take the financial burden off ourselves and David’s monthly contribution from collecting aluminum cans and his ODSP monthly housing allowance,” she explained on the campaign’s . “Once we have paid off the full price of the micro home the ownership will be transferred into David’s name and he will finally own his own home again. Our long-term goal is for David to own his micro-home and move it to a forever spot that he can live and regain a sense of independence again.” The response—including a single donation for $2,500 from a caring Samaritan—was so overwhelming that the total amount was soon raised. McDonald’s micro-house is set to be delivered before the cold weather sets in. While the brand-new tiny home can be transported anywhere, Cormier says that since she considers McDonald “part of the family,” he can stay as long as he likes. For McDonald, the measure of Cormier’s generosity isn’t about material things, it’s about the value of being treated with human dignity and respect. “You have to swallow your pride when you’re homeless,” he told CBC. “She’s done more than I can ever say thank you for.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/strangers-act-of-kindness-kim-cormier-david-mcdonald/
"This is the ‘best man speech ever’—given by the brother-of-the-groom who struggles socially but had everyone in tears and stitches. 23-year-old Sam Waldron announced to a room of people how his big brother Jonah Waldron 27, is his “hero” and “never looked down on me.” Sam talks about how he has autism ,which can make him scared to interact with people, but his brother reminds him “that being different is a real strength, not a weakness”. He says Jonah’s new wife, 25-year-old Madison Waldron, has “all the makings of a great sister”, and jokes she’s married the “second most handsome Waldron.” Sam says, “I was really nervous before the speech. Before I stood up, I wasn’t sure if everyone would like my speech, but I got more comfortable as I started reading. “I felt like I was speaking out to whoever has autism and that I was speaking for the autism community.” As for groom Jonah, on watching his little brother do such a brilliant job, he couldn’t hold back his tears of happiness. Brothers Sam and Jonah grew up together and, being only four years apart in age, went to the same school. Sam was diagnosed with autism when he was seven years old, and didn’t find intense social settings easy. Jonah said, “He would come to see me during the school day, he would come for help with a subject or as a break. “Myself and my parents were the ones he felt the most comfortable talking to about any struggles that he had socially. “I also became his Respite Care worker, helping him practice social situations in public settings.” Caring big brother Jonah was even inspired to train as a Special Education Teacher to help other children with special needs. Jonah and teacher Madison met at Wartburg College, and when Jonah introduced his new girlfriend to younger brother Sam, the two were immediate best friends. Jonah said, “Once he met Maddy, he felt completely comfortable right away.” The couple got engaged on July 23 while on a trip to Colorado. Of course, Jonah asked Sam to be his best man as soon as they got home. “I’ve always known that I wanted Sam as my best man,” said Jonah. “He was very happy, but also you could see that he was nervous too.” For Sam, “I felt like my dream came true… I got to be around my best brother.” Sam spent two whole days perfecting his speech before the big day arrived on July 3 this year. “I would just sit there and just read it aloud,” he said. “I read it to my Aunt Colleen, Andrew Hoyt and my Dad many times.” Sam stood up in front of the 170 wedding guests to deliver his speech. Jonah said, “My favorite part was when he was explaining to Maddy that she gave him peace, because that is exactly how I would explain the way she is with Sam. After he finished, Sam was given a standing ovation and the newly-weds rushed over to tell him how much of a great job he did. The entire speech was recorded and uploaded to Jonah’s TikTok account, and went viral, with over 6.2 million views and 760,000 likes. Thank you, Sam, for inspiring so many with your emotional speech.

"A small act of kindness can go a long way, say researchers, towards bolstering student health and wellness. Dr. John-Tyler Binfet and Dr. Sally Stewart at the University of British Columbia recently published a study that explores how the inclusion of a kindness assignment in an undergraduate course impacted student perceptions of themselves, their peers, and their campus. While there have been several studies that have assessed the effects of kindness on wellbeing, there has been limited research into how university-aged students understand and enact kindness, says Dr. Binfet. Thousands of university students returned to class across Canada in September, and Dr. Binfet notes that while living in the times of COVID-19 every act of kindness goes a long way. “We know being kind yields a number of wellbeing benefits, such as stress reduction, happiness and peer acceptance, and we know mental health impacts learning,” says Dr. Binfet. “The post-secondary environment is often the last training ground to prepare students for life so we want to understand how we can prepare students for optimal mental health as adults.” For the study, volunteer students provided self-reports to determine the extent they see themselves as kind in online and face-to-face interactions, and how connected they felt to their peers and the campus. The students were then asked to plan and complete five kind acts for one week. The participants completed 353 kind acts with the main themes of helping others, giving, demonstrating appreciation and communicating. Students that completed at least three of the five planned acts of kindness self-reported significantly higher scores of in-person kindness and peer connectedness. “This research can help students realize that there is evidence behind how and why people are kind, and that kindness does impact health and wellbeing,” says Dr. Stewart. “It also has an incredible impact for teaching in higher education as it provides insight into where students are at with their practice and understanding of kindness in order to build the groundwork for inclusion of this topic within educational practices and course content areas.” While there are on-campus wellbeing resources available to students at most post-secondary schools, this research demonstrates that by including wellbeing initiatives into coursework, it’s easier for more students to engage in those activities and receive benefits without added effort. The study also demonstrated that a curriculum-based kindness intervention would be well received by students. “We found that the students loved the assignment,” says Dr. Stewart of the study, published in . “For some, it helped them realize that kindness is a skill that they can learn to do better and that there are many ways to be kind. For others, it helped them realize that they already do kind things. It reinforced their desire and intention of doing more kind acts.” For years, Dr. Binfet’s research has focused on elevating the discussion of kindness, and he has previously completed studies on how children and adolescents perceive and enact kindness. “With this research, we now see alignment in how university students and school-age participants define kindness—to them it means actions that can improve the lives of others. Often, it’s simple things such as being polite and helping others,” says Dr. Binfet.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/small-acts-of-kindness-make-happier-students-ubc/
"A study from the University of California, Davis is the first to document personality in golden-mantled ground squirrels, which are common across the western U.S. and parts of Canada. The study found the squirrels show personality for four main traits: boldness, aggressiveness, activity level, and sociability. The findings suggest that understanding how an animal’s personality influences use of space is important for wildlife conservation. To see them chitter and skitter, stop and then scurry, the fact that ground squirrels have personalities may not seem surprising. But the scientific field of animal personality is relatively young, as is the recognition that there are ecological consequences of animal personality. For instance, bolder, more aggressive squirrels may find more food or defend a larger territory, but their risky behavior may also make them vulnerable to predation or accidents. “This adds to the small but growing number of studies showing that individuals matter,” said lead author Jaclyn Aliperti, who conducted the study while earning her Ph.D. in ecology at UC Davis. “Accounting for personality in wildlife management may be especially important when predicting wildlife responses to new conditions, such as changes or destruction of habitat due to human activity.” Scientists have been studying golden-mantled ground squirrels at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Gothic, Colorado for decades. It was established as a long-term study site more than 30 years ago by Aliperti’s advisor, Dirk Van Vuren. Aliperti drew from this powerful data set for her study, while also initiating a series of experiments there over the course of three summers to observe and quantify the squirrels’ personalities. She notes that while there are no Meyers-Briggs tests for animals, there are standardized approaches to quantifying animal personalities. She observed and recorded squirrel responses to four tests: Overall, the study, published in the journal , found that bolder squirrels had larger core areas where they concentrated their activity. Bold, active squirrels moved faster. Also, squirrels that were bolder, more aggressive and more active had greater access to perches, such as rocks. Perch access is important because it can provide a better vantage point for seeing and evading predators. Interestingly, perch access was also associated with sociability. Golden-mantled ground squirrels are considered an asocial species. They are relatively small, giving them little opportunity to form the tighter social bonds common in larger ground squirrels, which typically spend more time in family units while reaching maturity. However, the study said that “within this asocial species, individuals that tend to be relatively more social seem to have an advantage.” In such cases, being more social could save an individual’s life. Such personality differences can influence a squirrel’s ability to survive and reproduce, which could scale up to the population or community level. UC Davis is home to many squirrels, which have become an honorary mascot of sorts on campus. “The squirrels of UC Davis are something else,” said Aliperti. She means it literally. They are tree squirrels and very different from the ground squirrels Aliperti studied. Yet she says her work has changed how she views the squirrels of Davis. “I view them more as individuals,” Aliperti said. “I view them as, ‘Who are you? Where are you going? What are up to?’ versus on a species level.” Noticing such individuality brings a more personal angle to viewing wildlife. “Animal personality is a hard science, but if it makes you relate to animals more, maybe people will be more interested in conserving them,” said Aliperti.

"The Chinese have a long, ancient history of recording “guest stars”—suddenly bright stars that appear in the sky for a while but then dim and disappear. Today we know these are rare, incredibly energetic supernova explosions from either massive stars or special, interacting binary systems that seed the Galaxy with heavy elements like iron and leaving behind neutron stars, pulsars, black holes and a gaseous remnant like the Crab nebula. Now, a 900-year-old mystery on the true origins of the Chinese guest star of AD 1181 has finally been solved by an international team of astronomers. The Laboratory for Space Research (LSR) and Department of Physics of The University of Hong Kong (HKU) joined hands with collaborators from the UK, Spain, Hungary and France, pursued an investigation to unravel this mystery via newly uncovered clues of their own discovery. Remarkably, the guest star of AD 1181, reported at the time to be as bright as the planet Saturn, was the only historical supernova (SN) of the last thousand years that has been without identification with a real object. Published recently in the prestigious , this team reports the identification of SN of AD 1181 with their previous co-discovery in 2017 of “Parker’s star”, the hottest known Wolf-Rayet star (itself a truly unique object) with a temperature of more than 200,000 degrees Celsius. This star also has a surrounding nebula Pa30, discovered by their amateur colleague Dana PATCHICK in 2013. Corresponding author Professor Quentin PARKER, also the Director of LSR said, “Our data showed the expanding gas cloud from this star has extreme velocities of around 1,100km/s from an explosion about 1,000 years ago. This matches the AD 1181 event. “Not only that but Pa30/Parker’s stars position in the sky fits the historical Chinese and Japanese reports on the guest star to within 3.5 degrees—well within the errors.” Pa30 and Parker’s star have previously been proposed as the result of a merger of two White Dwarfs—dense, dead stars, leading to a rare Type Iax supernova. The reported historical brightness and modern distance determined for their system suggests the event was dimmer than typical supernovae. This also agrees with the rare Type Iax designation, only the second of its kind known in the entire Galaxy. Dr Andreas RITTER, the paper’s first author and HKU Postdoctoral Fellow within the LSR said, “Taken together, the age, location, reported “Guest star” brightness and recorded visibility for 6 months, shows that Parker’s star and its surrounding gas shroud Pa30 are indeed the counterparts of supernova SN of AD 1181.” The SN of AD 1181 event is also the only Type Iax supernova where detailed studies of the remnant star and surrounding nebula are possible. Combined with the extreme and remarkable nature of Parker’s star itself and their linking of it to the AD 1181 supernova, this source becomes of considerable scientific and historical interest. Finally, Parker’s star is the only Wolf Rayet star known that is neither from a massive progenitor star nor the central star of a planetary nebula. Instead, it is the result of two white dwarf stars merging together and accompanied by a Type Iax supernova explosion that now has a firm historical basis.

"The remains of a giant prehistoric penguin were discovered fossilized on a beach on New Zealand, delighting a group of young students, and filling in gaps in the fossil record at the same time. The penguin would have stood 1.4 meters tall, while underwater it could stretch out to 1.6 meters, making it far larger than any diving bird alive today. While originally looking for small crustacean fossils in Waikato, New Zealand in 2006, the Hamilton junior naturalist club were returning to their kayaks when they crossed a beach at extreme-low tide and found something that clearly wasn’t a crustacean. Fortunately for them they were accompanied by a seasoned paleontologist, Embedded in sandstone, the specimen needed extraction with petrol-powered cement saws and jackhammers, after which it was donated to a local Maori museum. A the new penguin species, borrowing the Māori word for long-legged, explains that penguins have arguably the most complete fossil record of any avian genus, and was able to unite a group of existing giant penguins from New Zealand. Diving for fish at a time when the North Island’s Waikato was largely underwater, the giant penguin lived between 34 and 27 million years ago. Among the inquiries generated by a complete giant penguin fossil lineage of three different giant penguin species is the question of why were there so many giant birds in New Zealand? The Haast’s eagle, though driven extinct by humans, was the largest eagle to ever live, weighing up to 33 pounds with a ten-foot wingspan. There were nine species of the large flightless Moa bird, which could stand 12 feet tall and weigh 500 pounds or more. The —weighing twice as much as the heaviest living cockatoo, and which could stand up to reach the height of an adult male’s waist, also lived in New Zealand. “Giant penguins like are much larger than any diving seabird today, and we know that body size can be an important factor when thinking about ecology,” said Mike Safey, president of the Hamilton junior naturalist club, to . “How and why did penguins become giant, and why aren’t there any giants left? Well-preserved fossils like this can help us address these questions.” Safey was actually one of those kids who discovered the fossil 15 years ago, and said that seeing it make major contributions to academia today was “surreal.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/giant-pengiun-fossil-found-in-new-zealand-by-kids-unites-ancient-genus/
"The state government of Alabama is drafting amendments to its 1901 State Constitution that would remove, among other things, discriminatory language. The changes would mark the end of the last remaining legal remnants of what are generally referred to as Jim Crow laws, which created a state-sponsored education system separated by race, and in which the Constitution allowed state authorities to forcibly place children in the educational institution of the state’s choosing. Having failed to pass referendums on the motion in 2004 and 2014, a 2020 third-time’s-the-charm vote got the job done; it established the , who will proceed to remove the Jim Crow passages, as well as others like poll taxes, duplicate language, and more. “It sends a message out about who we are,” said Rep. Merika Coleman, a Democrat from Pleasant Grove, who chairs the committee and sponsored the amendment. “It is important for us to let folks know we are a 21st century Alabama, that we’re not the same Alabama of 1901 that didn’t want Black and white folks to get married, that didn’t think that Black and white children should go to school together,” she said, . “The Legislature, upon the recommendation of the Director of the Legislative Services Agency through a proposed draft, may arrange this constitution, as amended, in proper articles, parts, and sections removing all racist language, delete duplicative and repealed provisions, consolidate provisions regarding economic development, arrange all local amendments by county of application during the 2022 Regular Session of the Legislature, and make no other changes,” a memo regarding to the recompilation . The most egregious piece of writing within the constitution is probably familiar to some, and states: “Separate schools shall be provided for white and colored children, and no child of either race shall be permitted to attend a school of the other race,” but another passage that declares the state shall be able to confiscate children and place them in whichever institution they want, regardless of their parents’ will, is also set to be removed.

"As an example of the majesty of life, the art of camouflage, and the extremes of evolution—one need look no further than the leafy seadragon of South Australia. Fondly called “Leafies” by the Aussies of Melbourne and Adelaide, it is a member of the genus that includes pipefishes, seadragons, and seahorses, and takes its name from the myriad of leaf-like protrusions along its body which serve only to camouflage it among seaweed stalks and kelp. Feeding on plankton and small crustaceans, they can grow to almost one foot in length. For propulsion they have dorsal and tail fins which are actually transparent compared to the leaf-like body parts that do nothing—they gently move the animal back and forth as it swims, mimicking the dancing seaweed around it, camouflages its movements on land. The dedication to camouflage and defense is impressive. In the wild, some individuals remaining still for 68 hours straight. Furthermore, their body is coated in hard bony plates and spikes, ruining the day of a fish tempted to take a bite out of it. However, in a bizarre riddle, there’s no sure evidence that any other animal preys on them. Maybe they “beat the game” or maybe, as antelope, they evolved their exquisite protection against a species which no longer exists. Living solitary lives around 160 feet underwater, the males and females will come together to breed—it’s the male’s responsibility to carry eggs and raise young. The female will lay 250 eggs and deposit them in a kangaroo-like . Unsurprisingly, such a charismatic animal is prized as an aquarium species by collectors, and alongside pollution these are the animals biggest threats. Thankfully, the animal is not endangered, and is currented listed by the IUCN as a species of Least Concern.

"Of course, the commentary of wise figures from would be relevant for every day and every moment, such is the power of J.R.R. Tolkien’s writings. While Tolkien vehemently rejected that his fantasy masterpiece represented anything allegorical whatsoever, one might say that it has launched itself forward to stand among the principle allegories of our time. I recently took to trilogy books once again, as my lack of television has barred me from watching the films for two-and-a-half years, and I couldn’t help but measure everything I’ve seen since COVID-19 arrived to the circumstances of Tolkien and of his chief protagonist Frodo Baggins. In the edition I read (which was not the edition my brother and I owned when we were young), a detailed foreword written by the author explained how the book came to be when he took up his pen in the waxing years of the turmoil that would become World War II. In it I found something which Gandalf the Grey might describe as “an encouraging thought,” a feeling that struck me again as I read the innocence in Frodo’s voice as he realizes he must leave his home forever on a perilous quest from which he likely would never return. Today, with warnings of waning immunity, fourth waves, and more, I thought an interview with Frodo, Gandalf, and their creator might make for a strong lesson in changing times, and our attitudes towards them. The best stories are the ones which are told the best, with all those wonderful literary keystones fitted neatly together. They are the ones we learn of in creative writing: can we see ourselves in the characters, are they flawed, do they make the right choice or the easy one, can we relate to their difficulties? Tolkien and his characters reflect, whether he would like them to or not, how the times during which one lives tend to vacuum them up, obscuring thoughts of the future or of the past. COVID-19 has been compared to many great crises, sometimes fairly, sometimes comedically, but we can learn from the great writer and his characters that the correct way out of a crisis is to never believe the current disaster is somehow unique in its dreadfulness. Tolkien became a man in perhaps the worst single moment in history to do so, around 1914, at the dawning of World War I. “In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly,” he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher later in life. “It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.” He was a junior officer at the Battle of the Somme, one of the most tragic events in human history, notable for the sheer empty-headedness of it all. Catching trench fever, he was shipped back to England, after which nearly every young man in his battalion was killed. Talk about a Hobbit’s luck. The Great War, described at the time as the “war to end all wars” was a singularity. Yet, as unbelievably calamitous as it had proved, twenty years later a new generation was set to do it all again. “One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years,” Tolkien writes in his foreword. He had not finished writing his iconic fantasy books upon the outbreak of the second ‘great war’ in 1939—and had not even finished the first part of the first book. “In spite of the darkness of the next five years I found that the story could not now wholly be abandoned and I plodded on, mostly by night,” he recalled. His son was serving in the British Royal Air Force, a difficult situation for any parent. Thank goodness you plodded on sir, thank goodness. Now we come to Frodo. Like the hobbit, so many of us in March of 2020 suddenly had our collective “Shires” clouded over. News coming out of Italy, China, and a cruise ship off the coast of Washington had placed the Ring of Power atop all our mantlepieces. A long, hard journey lay ahead. Among Frodo’s seminal strengths is one which shines during his encounter with the dark portents which Gandalf brings to him—that he must leave the Shire behind, perhaps forever. Rather than giving up or refusing to get involved, or feeling there may be no time for futures, he simply gets on with it, despite the fact that he admits he is very scared. “But this [the adventure] would mean exile, a flight from danger into danger, drawing it after me. And I suppose I must go alone, if I am to do that and save the Shire. But I feel very small, and very uprooted, and well—desperate.” “I should like to save the Shire, if I could,” he tells Gandalf. “I feel that as long as the Shire lies behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable: I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand there again.” And without much deciding at all really, Frodo acts, reasoning the world will continue to turn, and that it would turn all the better if he can throw the Ring into the Crack of Doom in Mordor, and thereby save the Shire. This, his partner Samwise also after seeing Frodo in a moment of doubt: “A new day will come, and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.” In a separate moment of weakness, Frodo wishes “none of this had happened,” something which many of us have said to ourselves over the last 18 months. Yet Gandalf responds, in one of the most wonderful things ever written in English, practically transposing Tolkien’s experience with the two World Wars and reminds Frodo: “So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All they have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to them.” ― (the final book in the trilogy)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/j-r-r-tolkein-frodo-baggins-and-gandalf-the-grey-on-covid-19/
"An Australian team has developed the world’s first behavior therapy shown to reduce autism spectrum disorder-like behavior enough in infants to avoid, through improvement, a clinical ASD diagnosis. The therapy reduced the likelihood of ASD-diagnoses at the three follow-up dates of 18, 24, and 36 months of age by two-thirds in 105 Australian children, and shows that early intervention—when autism is only suspected—can jumpstart the child’s social skills and produce positive knock-on effects later in life. The therapy is known as the VIPPP method, because how important our children are. In reality it stands for Video Interaction for Promoting Positive Parenting, and acts as a sort of translation app and play-by-play review, whereby following a period of interaction with a child displaying one of the four signs of early ASD, a doctor and parent can review footage of the interaction to help the them understand exactly how the child is trying to communicate. Instances of avoiding eye-contact or not responding to their name can be signs a child might go on to develop ASD, and working around those barriers to help the child develop social skills when they’re so young was the . “This is the first worldwide evidence that a pre-emptive intervention can reduce autism behaviours and the likelihood of a later diagnosis,” said Professor Andrew Green at the University of Manchester, according to the Guardian. “We think this is a landmark finding because it suggests intervention at this early time can have this substantial effect. It may well change the way services provide support to a large number of children worldwide.” While the statistical effect of the therapy wasn’t immense, there were other positives, for example the improvements made at baseline were sustained by 24 months. Furthermore while around 20% of the children who went without the therapy received an ASD diagnosis at age three, of the those who had the therapy did.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/a-breakthrough-therapy-reduced-autism-diagnoses-in-children-by-one-third/
"While the proper pronunciation of pecan remains a subject of debate, University of Georgia researchers have shown the tree nut can dramatically improve a person’s cholesterol levels. Participants at risk for cardiovascular disease who ate pecans during an eight-week intervention showed significant improvements in total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or “bad” cholesterol, in a study conducted by researchers in the UGA College of Family and Consumer Sciences. “This dietary intervention, when put in the context of different intervention studies, was extremely successful,” said Jamie Cooper, a professor in the FACS department of nutritional sciences and one of the study’s authors. “We had some people who actually went from having high cholesterol at the start of the study to no longer being in that category after the intervention.” Researchers saw an average drop of 5% in total cholesterol and between 6% and 9% in LDL among participants who consumed pecans. For context, researchers referred to a previous meta-analysis of 51 exercise interventions designed to lower cholesterol that reported an average reduction of 1% in total cholesterol and 5% in LDL cholesterol. “The addition of pecans to the diet not only produced a greater and more consistent reduction in total cholesterol and LDL compared to many other lifestyle interventions, but may also be a more sustainable approach for long-term health,” Cooper said. “Some research shows that even a 1% reduction in LDL is associated with a small reduction of coronary artery disease risk, so these reductions are definitely clinically meaningful.” Researchers assigned 52 adults between the ages of 30 and 75 who were at higher risk for cardiovascular disease to one of three groups. One group consumed 68 grams or about 470 calories of pecans a day as part of their regular diet; a second group substituted pecans for a similar amount of calories from their habitual diet, and a control group did not consume pecans. At eight weeks, participants consumed a high-fat meal to determine changes in blood lipids and the amount of glucose, or sugar, in the blood. Fasted blood lipids showed similar improvements among the two pecan groups while post-meal triglycerides were reduced in the group that added pecans. Post-meal glucose was lowered in the group that substituted pecans. “Whether people added them or substituted other foods in the diet for them, we still saw improvements and pretty similar responses in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in particular,” said Cooper, who also serves as director of the UGA Obesity Initiative. Researchers—whose work was published this month in the —pointed to the known bioactive properties of pecans for possible mechanisms driving the improvements. Pecans are high in healthy fatty acids and fiber, both of which have been linked to lower cholesterol.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/pecan-enriched-diet-shown-to-reduce-cholesterol-georgia/
"It was the spring of 2016, and 17-year-old Beatrice de Lavalette was waiting for a flight when she got hit by the terrorist bombing at Brussels airport. Along with serious burns and a spinal cord injury, De Lavalette lost both legs below the knee. Yet she says she wouldn’t be the person she is today if weren’t for those events… and the person is she will be competing as part of the U.S. Para-Equestrian team at the Paralympic Games in Tokyo. Riding is a passion not only for De Lavalette but for her family as well. She began riding at age 3 and by 12, she’d taken up dressage. Getting back in the saddle was no easy feat in light of her injuries, but she was determined to do so as soon as she was able. Five months after the bombings, thanks to her grit, determination—and extensive regimens of rehab and retraining—that’s exactly where she was. “I had no muscle, I was just skin and bones, so being back on the saddle with no sense of balance was really uncomfortable. But with time, I was able to build up the muscle and work on my balance, and it got easier with time,” she told . Of course, De Lavalette got a lot of help and encouragement along the way—from her family, her friends, the doctors and hospital staff—and from her beloved horse, DeeDee. Unsurprisingly, De Lavalette was depressed as she tried to come to terms with her injuries. She admits to crying a lot in the hospital until an unexpected visitor turned things around for her. “DeeDee saved my life,” De Lavalette said in an interview on . “My mom had figured out a way to get … DeeDee into the hospital parking lot. I said, ‘Where’s my [wheel]chair?’” “I went outside in the rain and as I got closer, she came towards me and put her head against my chest. That moment made me decide that I wasn’t going to give up on life.” It’s taken a great deal of hard work for De Lavalette to get where she is today. Having to adjust to her body’s new normal was, in many ways, like having to learn to ride all over again. But as her efforts began to pay off, the Paralympics seemed the perfect outlet to showcase her hard-earned skills. After making her first appearance as part of the U.S. Para-Dressage team in 2020, De Lavalette set her sights on Tokyo, where she’ll be riding an “awesome” 14-year-old Dutch Warmblood named Clarc. “The reason I’ve gotten to this level of recovery is because of my horses,” De Lavalette told . De Lavalette says, “I can’t change what happened, but I can succeed at being me. As I have said many times, I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. What else is there to say? There are no ‘What ifs.’ I have a new life in front of me,” she says on her . “What’s important is that I’m alive and I feel that I will do something grand with my life.” We’d say, she already has.

Poore recently took out a 30-foot billboard—located where else but Mission, Kansas—featuring Sally-Sue’s smiling face and a plea to potential pet parents to make room in their hearts and homes for the loving senior fur baby. “On social media, we tend to promote the same story to the same people,” Poore told . “A billboard, especially on I-35, it’s going to get thousands of views… All we need is that one right person to go by, make eye contact with the billboard, and we’re saving another life.” Since the billboard is a rental, Poore is working to find the permanent funding he’ll need to keep long-term shelter pets large in the public eye. Right now, he’s taking a one pooch at a time approach. When Sally Sue—currently at the —gets adopted, the next hopeful doggo candidate will get their shot at the “big time.” “The dogs that’ll be on the billboard are the ones that have been homeless the longest,” Poore told KMBC. “The goal is to find her not just a home, [but] the perfect home. As quickly as we do that, [we] move onto the next shelter pet that deserves to be up there.” While a billboard might be an unorthodox approach to pet adoption, every time another dog finds a home as a result, we’ll count that as mission accomplished.

"A bakery run by a Cambridge graduate is teaching ex-cons new skills, including providing bread to some of Scotland’s fanciest restaurants. Freedom Bakery, in Glasgow’s East End, provides well-known eateries including Ubiquitous Chip with bread rolls. The social enterprise was set up by Matt Fountain who grew up watching his stepfather struggle to establish a life after being released from jail in  Kent—and who he had visited in prison, aged 12, and begged never to go again. Matt enrolled in university courses in Manchester, studied History of Art in London, spent a year in Glasgow, and attended Cambridge. He returned to Glasgow and had the chance to do a PhD at Oxford, but opted not to. Instead he decided to invest his time and energy into helping people, including convicted murderers, reintegrate into society. In 2014, he was granted permission to use a small kitchen in HMP Low Moss, Glasgow. Matt planned to make and sell bread and at the same time put those prisoners through a recognized qualification for the baking industry, SVQ Level 2 in Craft Baking. By 2017 he was working with prisoners in notorious Barlinnie, and pairing them with qualified bakers in order to help them obtain a qualification. Trainee bakers have a broad variety of backgrounds, and Matt’s employees are given training in self-defence due to working with prisoners. There are currently 16 employees and a third were recruited from jails. Matt said: “It’s a mixture of long term and short term sentences including drugs-related offences, fraud, and I’m afraid to say manslaughter and murder.” Matt felt out of place in Cambridge and failed to find enjoyment in it. “By the end of it I was pretty worn out and because of my background, I felt like I was living a bit of a fake life. After struggling to get a job after graduating from Cambridge, he felt at a loose end. “I thought if I had an Oxbridge degree it would help me in life,” he said. “I didn’t really know what to do. “I came to the conclusion that I should be doing something useful and I set upon this idea to raise money for the charity Shelter by cycling around the UK.” That led to the idea of starting Freedom Bakery. Matt said: “The only ideal was to make sure it was really good so it would leave a lasting impression on the person eating it, so they would understand where it came from and maybe think more positively about who made that bread. “It is important our bread tastes great and for us to be really successful, our people need to be cared for and paid fairly and if those things combine it means the bread we make is really doing good.” He described prisons as “a microcosm of humanity with both good and evil.” Matt said: “For some, the odds have been stacked against them from the beginning, so they never had a chance. An individual contacted us who has been in institutions from childhood. “He is completely institutionalized but he wants to get out and can imagine a life he can have that will be healthy and rewarding so that is what we are about.” In October the bakery will move to a larger premises. And it saw its sales increase by 12 per cent last year, despite lockdowns. Matt added: “I really feel that it is important to help people, but at the end of the day they have to want to help themselves. In terms of the help we can offer, that goes quite far with us.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bakery-scotland-ex-cons-freedom-bakery/
"The future connection between human waste, sanitation technology, and sustainable agriculture is becoming more evident. According to new research, countries could be moving closer to using human waste as fertilizer, closing the loop to more circular, sustainable economies. A new study directed by University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign civil and environmental engineering professor Jeremy Guest, characterizes the spatial distribution of human urine-derived nutrients—nitrogen, phosphorus. and potassium—and agricultural fertilizer demand to define supply-demand location typologies, their prevalence across the globe, and the implications for resource recovery. “The total amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium largely remains constant in our bodies, once we stop growing,” said Guest. “Whatever comes in through food and drink must come out in our urine, feces and sweat. Knowing that, we can estimate how much of each of these nutrients is in a population’s bodily waste if we know their diet.” Previous studies by Guest and others have assessed the potential for recovering the nutrients from human waste across the globe and identified locations with a surplus of human waste-derived nutrients relative to the local demand for agricultural fertilizers. “The new study is the first to describe human waste-derived nutrient supply-demand location relationships using a single mathematical equation,” Guest said. “The quality of sanitation infrastructure varies greatly across the globe, as do people’s diets and the availability of land suitable for agriculture. Having the means to characterize and quantitatively compare a location’s nutrient-recovery potential can go a long way to better inform decision-makers when it comes to future sanitation and agriculture policy.” The team performed extensive numerical and geographic analyses of dietary, population, sanitation and agricultural data from 107 countries to accomplish this quantitative characterization at the global scale. The investigation revealed three distinct supply-demand typologies: countries with a co-located supply-demand; countries with a dislocated supply-demand; and countries with diverse supply-demand proximities. The United States and Australia, for example, fall under the dislocated supply-demand typology. They have intensive agriculture in areas far from large cities, thus the human waste-derived nutrient supply is far away from where it is needed, Guest said. Even with advanced sanitation infrastructure in place, this means that nutrients would need to be transported over large distances, either as heavy fluids or converted into concentrated crystalline products. Economically speaking, Guest said, it would make sense to work with a concentrated product to implement a human waste-derived fertilizer in these countries. The study reports that in countries with co-located supply-demand typologies like India, Nigeria, and Uganda, human populations are more substantively in the proximity of agricultural areas, making local reuse possible. In many communities with co-located supply-demand, however, there is a need for improved sanitation infrastructure. Guest said implementing a human waste-derived fertilizer program could be highly beneficial to sanitation and agriculture in these places. Countries like Brazil, Mexico, China, and Russia exhibit a continuum of co-location to dislocation of nutrient supply and demand. The study reports that policymakers would need to approach human waste-derived nutrient use with more regionalized strategies and a range of local reuse and transport approaches. “Higher income countries in this group may have the infrastructure and economic support for various technologies, but those with limited financial resources would require prioritization of resource-recovery technology in some areas,” Guest said. The team was surprised to find the typologies corresponded closely to the United Nations Human Development Index. “Higher HDI-scoring countries like the U.S., Western Europe, and Australia tend to fall in the dislocated supply-demand typology and lower HDI-scoring countries tend to fit the co-located supply-demand typology. Of course, there are exceptions, but we did not expect to find such a strong correlation,” Guest said. The findings are published in the journal . The team hopes this research will help clarify the salient economic, sanitation, and agricultural characteristics of countries across the globe so that decision-makers can prioritize investment, policies, and technologies that will advance goals for a circular economy and the provision of sanitation to all, Guest explained. That sounds like good news to us.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/human-waste-is-poised-to-sustain-agriculture-university-illinois/

Two of Daryani’s five-and-a-bit-feet-tall devices cost less than the latest iPhone, while filtering 300 cubic feet of air per minute—more than enough for a small family house.

"In concluding their expedition to Wolf Volcano, on Isabela Island in the Galápagos, scientists have conducted the first survey of the pink land iguana, a criticallyendangered species that lives nowhere else on Earth. The survey used camera traps and involved 30 scientists spreading out over nearly 1,000 acres of the “most inhospitable places in Galápagos,” positively identifying 53 adult pink land iguanas, but no juveniles. The effort which took place through early-to-mid August was led by Conservation Manager Jorge Carrión and Conservation Director Washington Tapia at the Galápagos Conservancy, who have overseen some remarkable close shaves at their hugely successful Giant Tortoise Restoration Initiative. The pair recently reported on their , and how with a little data, and a little hope, they believe they can rescue this quite recently-discovered species from the brink on which it was found. “They are iconic as much for being recently discovered and limited to a small geographic area, as for the inherent challenges of managing the future of an animal of which we know very little about,” Carrión wrote, at the Conservancy’s . The challenges of conserving them are partly the terrain, as Carrión details, for Wolf Volcano is as unwelcoming as a wolf or volcano. The iguanas nest at 5,600 feet above sea level, where the there is little shade, and the temperatures can rise to 100 °F, and 160 °F at the level of the ground. At night however, the temperature plummets to 50 °F, but strong, constant and freezing wind. The steep, mountainous ground is littered with cacti, and there are more ticks on Isabella than any other island. Finally, the iguanas can easily bite a finger off if they get the opportunity, so handling them is so sure bet. “During the expedition, we documented never-before-seen behavior such as the symbiotic relationship with Darwin’s finches, which feed on parasites on the iguana’s body, and the unusual sight of an iguana seeking out the sun on a tree branch in an area where the sunlight couldn’t penetrate the dense undergrowth.” The last juvenile was spotted in 2014, just five years after the species was first officially described as different from both the normal, and yellow land iguanas of the famous islands. Using the mark and recapture method of analysis, the Conservancy on Isabella. Iguana experts from around the world, at the behest of the Galápagos National Park Directorate, arrived for a brainstorming event on the data gathered during the expedition in late August.

It has the capacity to reduce water use in any system, from a well-manicured lawn to a rural vegetable farm in North Africa, and compared to drip irrigation which is based on a similar idea, it can reduce water use by 30-50%, revolutionizing the science and methods of irrigation in the face of a warming climate, longer droughts, and water shortages. (DRI) has designed a watering system that installs tubes under the earth filled with pore-like depressions. As plants begin to get thirsty they produce a certain chemical in their roots. The micropores in the tubes in turn detect this chemical and release a water drip that will continue until it detects the plants have drunk their fill. In , farmers are growing vegetables in the desert, and DRI won the startup of the year 2019 at the Global Forum for Innovations in Agriculture, while in Pakistan near the dry vegetables like tomatoes and bok choy were grown 81% faster and twice as large, respectively, than with regular drip irrigation. In fact, DRI is established in 14 countries, from rural Zimbabwe to lawns in Utah and Los Angeles in the U.S. The biggest hurdle stopping RDI from changing the industry is that existing methods of irrigation are already established and paid for. Convincing farmers to make the switch could be difficult, especially in certain areas, like California, where the irrigation systems have not only been around for decades, but link multiple farms and orchards like a spider’s web. Yet “wherever there’s an issue with water scarcity and food security, we want to be there,” Jan Gould, founder of Responsive Drip Irrigation, told",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/responsive-drip-irrigation-system-changes-agriculture-saves-30-50-water-costs/
"A hero schoolgirl who saved people trapped in a burning apartment raised the alarm after being inspired by a TV show about the emergency services. 14-year-old Lily Swanson is obsessed with the Disney+ show so when she noticed a strong burning smell she immediately stopped to investigate. She had been on a walk with her Rottweiler Isobel near her home in Leyland, Lancashire, but decided to try and find the source of the smell. The quick-thinking teenager looked around and finally spotted black smoke billowing out of an apartment window on Hough Lane. Lily ran home to wake her dad Mike Swanson and rang 999. Mike grabbed his ladders and ran to the scene to help those trapped inside before the building was engulfed in flames. Lily said, “As soon as I called the fire brigade, we ran back outside and we could see people hanging out the window. “It had only been a minute or two since I first saw the smoke but as we were running over to help them, one of the windows blew off and fell into the street. “That’s when me and my dad saw the flames. I told my dad we should try and get everyone out of the other window above the barber’s next door. “We opened the ladders and leaned them against the building and there were two or three people trying to climb out. They were desperate.” Thankfully, everyone was evacuated safely after emergency services arrived at the scene just minutes later. Lily added, “But then the fire brigade showed up very quickly and took over. We couldn’t believe how fast they got there. “We did everything we could do and thankfully everyone got out safely, which is the best that could have happened.” Lily and her dad stayed at the scene while fire crews evacuated the building and ensured everyone was safe. Mike said, “It was a proud dad moment for me, as it could have been a lot worse if it wasn’t for Lily’s quick response. “She’s been obsessed with this TV programme on Disney+. It’s about emergency services in America who deal with things like this. “Then this happened practically on our doorstep and she handled it brilliantly. I’m very proud.” Leyland fire station manager Jonny Nottingham, who was the incident commander on the night of the fire, praised Lily for her quick and calm response. Mr Nottingham said, “We’d like to thank Lily for calling us so quickly after spotting the fire in the apartment. “We have seen in the past that people can have lots of different reactions to seeing a fire but Lily showed maturity and calmness beyond her years to quickly and effectively notify us.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/hero-schoolgirl-fire-lancashire-lily-swanson/
"One Glasgow nightclub is working to sustainably harness the energy released from its partiers on the dance floor. The pioneering system at SWG3 could save the popular nightspot up to In the run-up to the UN’s in Glasgow this November, BODYHEAT turns the energy from dancing bodies into a source for heating and cooling outlets. A statement from the club says, “We’re hugely excited to reveal our plans to introduce a state-of-the-art renewable heating and cooling system to the SWG3 complex, transforming body heat from clubbers and gig-goers into a source of energy to be used again.” The first of its kind to be installed in Scotland, BODYHEAT uses heat pumps and fluids to capture body heat generated by SWG3’s crowds, channeling their combined energy into twelve 150m-deep bore holes drilled beneath the venue. This heat can then either be used immediately to cool the audience, or stored under the ground until it’s needed to heat the building. Idly mingling, a human body radiates about 100 watts of excess heat, which can add up fast in confined spaces, and the enormous amount of heat that people dancing at clubs or gigs generate is currently ejected into the atmosphere as waste. “With this new system in place,” says the club, “we’ll be able to utilize that warmth, consuming minimal electricity and gas on site, and in turn minimizing our carbon emissions” “There’s no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought huge challenges to the events sector around the world,” said Andrew Fleming Brown, Managing Director, “but it has also created a seismic jolt across businesses, underlining the need for a stable and sustainable future.” “BODYHEAT is our innovative contribution to a global issue, and will help us to dramatically decrease our energy consumption, bringing us one step closer to becoming a carbon neutral venue in the not so distant future.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nightclub-glasgow-dancers-energy-swg3/
"A cure for osteoarthritis could be no further than the end of your nose—as nasal cells can relieve chronic inflammation in the knee, according to new research. Doctors say the treatment could revolutionize therapy for a crippling condition that impacts 8.5 million people in the UK alone. The cells originate from embryonic brain and spinal cord tissue—known as the neuroectoderm. Co-lead author Professor Ivan Martin, of Basel University in Switzerland, described them as “amazing.” He explained, “Unlike the cartilage tissue in the joints, these cartilage cells originate from precursor cells of the neuroectoderm. They therefore have a distinct regenerative and adaptive capacity—or plasticity. Tissue grown from nasal cartilage cells seems also to retain these special properties.” Unlike other tissues cartilage that cushions the surface of joints has little capacity to grow back. Osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, can lead to damage. Knee replacement surgery is often the only option. Now clinical studies have shown cartilage cells from the nasal septum, the partition that divides the nostrils, combat the disease. Orthopaedic and plastic surgeons took a tissue sample from the noses of two patients—and cultivated them in the lab. They then used them to grow a cartilage layer that was then implanted into the knee joint. The young volunteers had severe osteoarthritis due to misalignment of the leg bones. They faced having a whole knee prosthesis. But following implantation of the engineered cartilage both reported a reduction in pain, and increased quality of life. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans showed the bones in the knee of one of the patients were further apart than previously. This was an indication of the joint’s recovery. The other volunteer could only be interviewed for a subjective assessment owing to the pandemic. The bones in both volunteers could be surgically corrected—and the most likely cause of their osteoarthritis eliminated, said the researchers. They are confident patients will be able to manage without knee joint prostheses, at least for some time. Martin said, “Our results have enabled us to lay the biological foundation for a therapy, and we are cautiously optimistic.” Unlike knee traumas caused by sports injuries and falls, an osteoarthritic knee suffers persistent inflammatory reactions. Martin said, “First we had to test whether the cartilage replacement was attacked and degenerated by the inflammatory factors.” The international team initially tested human cartilage tissue in the presence of inflammatory factors. Experiments were carried out in mice and various other models of the disease. Martin said, “First we had to test whether the cartilage replacement was attacked and degenerated by the inflammatory factors.” The durability of the tissue was also tested under stress and inflammation in sheep. Cartilage cells were taken from the nose of the animals and transplanted into their osteoarthritic knee joints. The tissue proved to be extremely robust—and also seemed to counteract the inflammatory reactions. Further analysis suggested the effect was caused by a chemicals fuelled by osteoarthritis, known as the WNT signaling pathway. The study, published in the journal , found it was dampened by by the presence of the nasal cartilage cells. In-depth clinical trials using the approach for the treatment of patellofemoral osteoarthritis are now being planned. It’s caused when the articular cartilage wears out and the bone ends rub on one another,  causing extreme pain. The researchers also aim to further develop the method for other types of osteoarthritis to treat a broader spectrum of patients. They pioneered nose-to-knee cartilage transplants a decade ago in nine patients who had suffered sports injuries, falls or other accidents. It followed successful experiments in goats. This is the first time it has been used for osteoarthritis. Globally it affects more than 300 million people. It occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of the bones wears down over time. Osteoarthritis can damage any joint but is usually found in the hands, knees, hips and spine. Osteoarthritis symptoms can usually be managed—although the damage to joints can’t be reversed. Staying active, maintaining a healthy weight and receiving certain treatments might slow progression and improve pain and joint function.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cure-for-osteoarthritis-basel-university/
"In the face of a legal challenge mounted by six Native American Tribes, a district court judge in Arizona has thrown out a Trump-era interpretation of the Clean Waters Act (CWA) that would allow actors to fill in, pollute, or dredge wetlands, streams, and marshlands, District Judge Rosemary Marquez noted that there were numerous “serious errors” in the regulation that was passed to help states better identify and manage waters that are legally protected by the CWA. It was in June that the Biden Administration they would revisit Trump’s Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR), but it was Marquez who felt that leaving it in place while new rules were made risked causing “serious environmental harm.” Marquez’s decision applies nationwide, according to the , and will protect drinking water and wildlife habitat for millions of Americans and billions of animals. As with most legal challenges in this country, the battle arose over unclear language. “To restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters,” the purpose of the CWA, defining the nation’s waters as “navigable waters of the United States, including territorial seas.” Navigable waters could mean a number of things. For starters, navigable by whom, humans or fish? Based on that lack of clarity, farmers and industry pushed the Trump Administration to allow the states to determine the fate of as many bodies of water as could be found without clear federal protection. These included feeder streams, marshes, and wetlands. In 2006, Justice Antonin Scalia authored a four-justice opinion which stated waters of the United States should be “relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water forming geographic features,” adding that “only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are ‘waters of the United States’.” However the Obama Administration’s revisiting of the CWA added federal protection for waters that were not “standing or continuously flowing,” like marshes that might feed a river far away, or even streams which only come alive during periods of heavy rainfall, such as a desert wash. It was these protections Trump acquiesced to eliminate. Indeed report from the Army Corps of Engineers, whose job it is to grant permits for dredging or filling waterways, stated that 333 currently-submitted projects would have required environmental review under the Obama rules, but not under Trump’s. The lawsuit was launched on behalf of six Native American Tribes by Earth Justice, who noted that between June 22, 2020 and April 15, 2021, the Corps approved jurisdictional determinations under the NWPR of 40,211 aquatic resources or water features, and found that approximately 76% were vulnerable under the NWPR. In states like Arizona and New Mexico where water resources are exceedingly precious, they found that almost every one of the 1,500 assessed ephemeral streams and washes were non-jurisdictional of the CWA. Marquez ruled that the potential ruination of these waters while the Biden team conduct their review could have “cascading and cumulative downstream effects,” invalidated and remanded the NWPR, and sent it off to the Corps and the EPA for review. “The sacred waters that were put at risk by the Trump administration are essential to our cultural and religious lives as indigenous people,” said Tohono O’odham Nation Chairman Ned Norris, Jr., whose tribe participated in the lawsuit. “This decision by the court rightfully vacates a grievous error.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/arizona-judge-throws-out-trump-clean-water-act-rule-saving-thousands-of-streams/
"The English phrase about someone being “silver-tongued” clearly runs cross-culturally, as recently a set of mummies were unearthed in Egypt, and one was buried with a golden tongue. The mummies date to the Greco-Roman period of Egypt after it had come under the thumb of the Northern Mediterranean following the conquests of Alexander the Great, and were found in gilded sarcophagi buried in rock-cut “wall-hole” tombs in the Temple of Taposiris Magna in the Classical-Era city of the same name. Within these small chambers, the mummies were in a poor state of preservation, which highlights, according to a from the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, the characteristics of mummification in the Greek and Roman periods. A gold foil amulet, shaped in the form of a tongue, was found placed in the mouth of a mummy in a special ritual to ensure their ability to speak before the Osirian court in the afterlife. Osiris was the god of the underworld, and it would be considered vital for people to have a way to speak with him. It’s not clear, but the gold tongue might have been related to that idea, although brought up that perhaps the deceased had a speech impediment. The two most important mummies were wrapped in golden bonds of papyrus. One bore decorations characteristic of Osiris, while the other wore an Atef crown, sporting horns and a coiled cobra around the head, and a falcon design on their chest to honor the god Horus. The discovery was made by a joint Egypt-Dominican team, led by Dr. Kathleen Martinez. They also discovered eight marble masks depicting faces of the Roman and Greco influence in the region with striking detail, and a near-body-length female funerary mask. “In the last 10 years, the mission has found several important archaeological finds that have changed our perception of the Temple of Taposiris Magna,” read the statement on the Ministry’s website. “A number of coins bearing the name and image of Queen Cleopatra VII were found inside the temple walls, in addition to many parts of statues.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/mummies-found-with-golden-tongues-in-egypt-city-of-taposiris/
"Registering 10,000 steps a day with a pedometer is a fine goal that deserves celebration, but far from being a doctor-recommended dose of activity, it’s actually a complete myth. The good news is that for most people whose physical activity is limited to walking, one need only accumulate between 4,500 and 7,000 steps a day to reduce, sometimes dramatically, their chance of dying young. Most governments, and we can start with the CDC at home, of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. The measurement is made with a unit of time and not of repetitions, which has its limits, as some studies show number of steps correlates more strongly with lower disease risk . According to Gretchen Reynolds the goal of accumulating 10,000 steps in a day for fitness’ sake is actually based on a fad invented by a Tokyo watchmaker in the wake of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, when more and more people in the city became interested in health and fitness. Like a harmless version of the other falsehoods in eastern medicinal practices (rhino horn tea anyone?) the idea that somehow 10,000 steps was the threshold for some exceptional therapeutic results spread across the globe. In reality 10,000 steps is almost 5 miles, a lot more than is necessary for lowering your disease risk. Reynolds points to a 2019 study that found woman in their 70s who managed just 4,500 steps a day lowered their risk for premature death of any cause by 40%, compared to those who walked just 2,700 steps or less. In a in 2020, it was found that among 4,840 adults aged 40 and up, walking 8,000 steps per day was enough to reduce risk of premature death by 49%. However the critical detail is that between 4,000 to 8,000 steps, the benefit was immense, but between 8,000 and 12,000, the benefit diminished, suggesting there is fast-approaching upper limit of how much benefit the mere act of walking will confer. It’s actually a good thing, probably, to suggest trying to walk 10,000 steps, but rather to walk between 6,000 to 8,000 steps, and use the time one saved to do other physical activities of equal importance such as weight training or stretching—both key factors in preventing various pathologies of morbidity like muscle and bone-density loss, or the loss in flexibility.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/if-your-health-goal-is-to-walk-10000-steps-a-day-7000-is-enough/
"It might be “herd” to believe, but some Louisiana cowboys recently undertook a very different kind of cattle drive after Hurricane Ida left grazing lands flooded—and they’ve been using airboats to do get the job done. “We got about 300 head of cattle… out here that we couldn’t get out from the back pastures in time before the storm came in, being that it was a quickly developing storm,” lead volunteer Derek Billiot told . In storms past, Billiot routinely employed his airboat to rescue people rather than livestock. This time, luckily, since most folks who found themselves in Ida’s path heeded advance evacuation orders, he didn’t have to. So far, Billiot and his water-skimming crew have rounded up about 60 head of cattle in Parish Plaquemines. The exhausted bovines aren’t always 100% cooperative, but at present, the rescuers are taking a “no cow left behind” attitude. Many of the stranded animals are mired in mud and trapped by marsh debris. The volunteers have been attempting to coax the heifers to higher ground when possible, but mostly, they’ve had to resort to roping the flood victims and dragging them to safety. While this good Samaritan-led cattle drive is a serious business, Billiot can’t help but see the lighter side of the roundup. “Welcome to south Louisiana,” he quipped. “ rodeoing.” ( one of the im- -vable cows below.)

"A romantic couple have become a TikTok sensation after their sunset engagement was unknowingly caught on camera by a passing photographer. 31-year-old Dan Rutterford popped the big question to partner Kay Lewis in what he thought was a totally secluded spot on the Cornish coastline of England. But photographer Lui Gazzard happened to be passing by when he spotted Dan go down on one knee in the distance. He quickly took some stunning snaps of the couple standing on a headland at Tintagel, Cornwall, with a gorgeous pink and purple sunset behind them. Lui then approached stunned Dan and Kay to say he’d captured the engagement—a moment that was recorded on a TikTok video—and has since garnered more than a million views and 191,000 likes. Holidaymakers Dan and Kay, from Romford in Essex, were staying in Tintagel with Kay’s three kids when they headed out for their weekly date night on Monday evening. The couple, who met four years ago, set up a picnic in a secluded spot on a headland looking out to the Atlantic Ocean before Dan mustered up the courage to propose. Afterwards, the couple celebrated with Kay’s three children and shared a bottle of prosecco. Lui was on holiday with his family in nearby Boscastle when he captured the pictures on an evening walk. He said, “It was one of those moments where everything came together. The guy was already down on one knee, then he got up and they were hugging. “It was nice that it was just the two of them on that headland.

"When we first partnered with our friends at Bioscarf in 2017, the Southern California wildfires making breathing hazardous in Los Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties. This scarf was the ideal solution to protect the wearer from dangerous particulate matter hanging in the air—and I got myself one (above), which I also used during the coronavirus pandemic. They now make comfortable masks, gaiters, and hoodies, too, all with incredible properties that allow for 50 washings, while still filtering the air at the N95 level or higher. It was invented by an American couple after a business trip to China, when Carlton Solle became ill, most likely due to complications related to air pollution. As an alternative to wearing ugly, unsustainable disposable masks to protect themselves, they turned to fashion. Back in Atlanta, his wife Hazel came up with the idea to design a product that would work both as a scarf and also a filter—and, in 2017, the company began sending free shipments to journalists who were out breathing the hazardous air while covering the fires—and to firefighters, too. The might be considered a genius example of wearable technology because it filters dangerous levels of toxic particulates, but it uses no gadgets, processors, or batteries. And, the best part is their filtration technology can be washed up to 100 times without losing its N95 rating. ( ) 3 layers of protection in their debut model guarded against hazardous contaminants that pose a health risk—including, according to the company, many of the bacteria and germs that cause colds and viruses (frequent flyers, take note). With its U.S. rating of N95, the generously sized scarf (as well as their newer gator and face mask) is capable of blocking 99.75% of all particles 0.1 microns in size or larger—and 95% of all non-oil based airborne particles measuring 0.3 microns. A “first of its kind”, these personal protective apparel items in olive, black, and white—made from sustainably constructed recycled materials. The plush polyester blend uses 100% post-consumer recycled PET water bottles, and customer satisfaction is guaranteed. By November of 2017, at the time of the Thomas Fire, the new company has already donated more than a thousand scarves in the U.S. to people in fire zones and elsewhere, and to friends in China where approximately 1.6 million people die prematurely every year due to poor air quality. Fast forward to 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began. I got in touch with Carlton and learned that they had added a variety of new products. Most notably, a line of cold weather gaiters, as well as summer scarves and gaiters made of hemp. They also added a pullover with built-in face mask, a hoodie which protects the entire upper body except the eyes, and a reusable, washable face mask, perfect for healthcare workers, which is less costly than the scarves or gaiters, retailing for just $29. With the recent addition of a nano-fiber layer, these new products can be washed 50 times before they even begin to degrade in the slightest. They can be washed 100 times and still be rated the equivalent of an N95, because their filtration technology is, as Carlton told me, “like N95 on steroids”. Similar masks are made for frontline workers, which you can . They include 1″ elastic bands in a specially designed strap system for secure fit and comfort all day—and they are reusable and washable up to 100 times, effectively replacing one million single-use disposable face masks. They feature a rugged exterior fabric that is water-resistant and anti-bacterial, too. The company, G95, is currently shipping their products within 1-2 days for FREE—using USPS Priority Mail in the US—and they now ship over $100 FREE via UPS. If you enter the code GNN20 at checkout you will get a any order over $100. “Anyone who is seeking a fashionable and functional scarf or other clothing item to protect themselves–or loved ones, and is interested in helping to turn the tide on sicknesses around the world, should ,” Hazel Solle told GNN. So now, besides being a perfect apparel piece for anyone who bicycles in the city, works around vehicles, regularly travels in airplanes or buses, or simply lives in a smoggy region, people can protect themselves from the COVID-19 virus. One customer wrote a review in October 2020 saying, “This is one of the BEST investments I ever made! I have the Basic Mask. I never, ever thought I would need it for anything except the virus.

"Although thousands of planets have been discovered in the Milky Way, most reside less than a few thousand light years from Earth. Yet our Galaxy is more than 100,000 light years across, making it difficult to investigate the Galactic distribution of planets. But now, a research team has found a way to overcome this hurdle. Researchers led by Osaka University and NASA have used a combination of observations and modeling to determine how the planet-hosting probability varies with the distance from the Galactic center. The observations were based on a phenomenon called gravitational microlensing, whereby objects such as planets act as lenses, bending and magnifying the light from distant stars. This effect can be used to detect cold planets similar to Jupiter and Neptune throughout the Milky Way, from the Galactic disk to the Galactic bulge—the central region of our Galaxy. “Gravitational microlensing currently provides the only way to investigate the distribution of planets in the Milky Way,” says Daisuke Suzuki, co-author of the study. “But until now, little is known mainly because of the difficulty in measuring the distance to planets that are more than 10,000 light years from the Sun.” To solve this problem, the researchers instead considered the distribution of a quantity that describes the relative motion of the lens and distant light source in planetary microlensing. By comparing the distribution observed in microlensing events with that predicted by a Galactic model, the research team could infer the Galactic distribution of planets. The results show that the planetary distribution is not strongly dependent on the distance from the Galactic center. Instead, cold planets orbiting far from their stars seem to exist universally in the Milky Way. This includes the Galactic bulge, which has a very different environment to the solar neighborhood, and where the presence of planets has long been uncertain. “Stars in the bulge region are older and are located much closer to each other than stars in the solar neighborhood,” explains lead author of the study Naoki Koshimoto, which was published in . “Our finding that planets reside in both these stellar environments could lead to an improved understanding of how planets form and the history of planet formation in the Milky Way.” According to the researchers, the next step should be to combine these results with measurements of microlens parallax or lens brightness—two other important quantities associated with planetary microlensing.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nasa-osaka-cold-planets-milky-way-research/
"In times of war and crisis, it’s important to remember that for every story of loss and tragedy, there is a story of courage and generosity—such is the case with Afghanistan’s Youth Scout program. The country has been embroiled in conflict for more than 40 years, and growing up in that turmoil, Mohammad Hamkar decided to revive Afghanistan’s fledgling scout program in the 2010s from a compound of almond and peach trees on the outskirts of Kabul. He and his NGO-partner Marnie Gustavson, an American who remembers living in Kabul during earlier peaceful days, have been working to uplift the lives of rural boys and girls through worldwide scouting mandates—especially encouraging a sense of responsibility and service to the community, particularly during the last two months. As members of the —(Physiotherapy And Rehabilitation Services for Afghanistan) which focuses on rebuilding Afghan communities—Hamkar and Gustavson realized the power of the Merit Badge in giving young people a worthwhile path to follow in life. Hamkar has trained 600 volunteers to be scoutmasters, and was proud to regain membership in the World Organization of Scout Movements, restoring scouting as a national pursuit that dated back to 1931. “We have about 10,000 scouts around the country,” PARSA director Marnie Gustavson, who left the country during the Taliban’s recent victory in Kabul, told “What the scouts accomplish across the country—particularly their focus on community service—is just remarkable.” After the Taliban resumed power, refugees poured into parks around Kabul. It was a situation Hamkar and his scouts were born to solve. Gathering up tents, sleeping bags, and other emergency supplies, they created a safe, functioning campsite where 45 displaced families could get shelter, and receive food and water. When the Taliban heard about what was going on, they accused Hamkar of teaching Christianity, an allegation that was easy enough for him to disprove. Soon after, the Taliban government issued the all-clear for PARSA to continue its work, which included the scouts returning to the streets and outskirts of Kabul to lend a helping hand, and presumably, to continue stacking up their merit badges. A great way to show support for your fellow scouts is by to help PARSA continue the program that offers role models for Afghan youth.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/taliban-gives-permission-for-afghan-youth-scout-program-to-continue/
"1.3 million people in the Netherlands are older than 75 years—and one large supermarket chain is making sure they’re not getting too lonely in their elder years. The Dutch government with its campaign, ‘One Against Loneliness’, has galvanized organizations, towns, companies, and individuals to find solutions. The grocer giant, Jumbo, is doing their part with its innovative chatty check outs. The idea for the ‘Kletskassa’, which translates to ‘chat checkout’, originated more than two years ago—and in the summer of 2019 the first Kletskassa was opened in Vlijmen in Brabant. This resulted in many positive reactions from customers—and now Jumbo is expanding the initiative further: By this time next year, there will be chat checkouts in 200 stores across the country where people can go for a conversation. When choosing the stores, areas where loneliness is a major factor are carefully considered. Colette Cloosterman-van Eerd, CCO of Jumbo and the driving force behind the National Coalition against Loneliness, is closely involved in the initiative. , “Many people, especially the elderly, sometimes feel lonely. As a family business and supermarket chain, we are at the heart of society.” “Our stores are an important meeting place for many people and we want to play a role in identifying and reducing loneliness. We do this in various ways, including our Kletskassas. We are proud that many of our cashiers like to take a seat behind a Kletskassa. They support the initiative and want to help people to make real contact with them out of genuine interest.” “It is a small gesture, but very valuable, especially in a world that is digitizing and getting faster and faster.” In addition to the Kletskassas, Jumbo has various other initiatives to establish personal contact between people. Cloosterman-van Eerd explained that, “At Jumbo we want to be more than just a place where you do your shopping. For example, we help our stores by means of a manual to signal loneliness among customers and to set up local initiatives… Several stores also have a chat corner where customers can grab a nice cup of coffee and chat with neighbors.” The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport the establishment of local coalitions against loneliness in each of the 355 municipalities across the country for organizing programs such as home visits, telephone hotlines, and creating maps of activities for nearby seniors.

"A Canadian nuclear fusion power company has garnered a $400 million investment to build a demonstration energy plant in the UK.

The pistons power the fusion process—creating a magnetic field that causes hydrogen atoms inside a superheated gas known as a plasma to overcome their electromagnetic resistance and fuse together. The fusion requires temperatures of at least 100 million Celsius, and existing fusion technologies are struggling to find a way to keep the plasma at that temperature for long periods. For other methods and companies, it’s not a question of “can we generate electricity from fusion,” or even even “can we keep the plasma heated to generate electricity continuously,” but “how can we generate more electricity than we use?” General Fusion has focused on commercializing the technology which, for example, cost ITER over $20 billion for a prototype. Instead of using magnets to heat and contain the plasma, General Fusion uses a plasma injector—a separate machine—to create a plasma under more economical conditions, and inject it into the fusion reactor’s main chamber. Inside the chamber is a spinning wall of liquid lithium, which is compressed into a tiny sphere by the pistons. The compression heats the plasma to fusion temperatures, releasing huge amounts of heat, which the liquid metal absorbs easily. It is that heat that is exacted to create steam, which is used to power a turbine, which creates electricity with only helium as the waste product. “This is incredibly exciting news for not only General Fusion, but also the global effort to develop practical fusion energy,” Christofer Mowry, CEO of General Fusion, who predicts the fusion market to be worth $1 trillion in the next decade. One of the best parts of fusion is it’s completely safe, as there’s no radioactive anything, and helium is the only byproduct. While 100 million Celsius seems dangerous, “if you were to blow on this thing, it just turns itself off,” Dennis Whyte, a Canadian scientist who is director of plasma science fusion center at MIT, Furthermore, it uses a tiny amount of fuel, and Commonwealth Fusion Systems estimate a cup of something as simple as seawater would generate enough electricity to take care of the power usage of one human for their entire lifetime. Just 70 grams of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium, which are captured during the fusion reaction is enough to power a small city. “It’s probably the last energy source we’ll ever tame,” said Whyte. “I think of the trajectory from taming fire and it finally completes in fusion, because we’ll have tamed the energy source of the stars.” ( the videos for this story below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/canadian-fusion-energy-startup-to-build-400m-demonstration-plant/
"While black holes and toddlers don’t seem to have much in common, they are remarkably similar in one aspect: Both are messy eaters, generating ample evidence that a meal has taken place. But whereas one might leave behind droppings of pasta or splatters of yogurt, the other creates an aftermath of mind-boggling proportions. When a black hole gobbles up a star, it produces what astronomers call a “tidal disruption event.” The shredding of the hapless star is accompanied by an outburst of radiation that can outshine the combined light of every star in the black hole’s host galaxy for months, even years. A team of astronomers led by Sixiang Wen, a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Arizona Steward Observatory, use the X-rays emitted by a tidal disruption event known as J2150 to make the first measurements of both the black hole’s mass and spin. This black hole is of a particular type—an intermediate-mass black hole—which has long eluded observation. “The fact that we were able to catch this black hole while it was devouring a star offers a remarkable opportunity to observe what otherwise would be invisible,” said Ann Zabludoff, UArizona professor of astronomy and co-author on the paper. “Not only that, by analyzing the flare we were able to better understand this elusive category of black holes, which may well account for the majority of black holes in the centers of galaxies.” By re-analyzing the X-ray data used to observe the J2150 flare, and comparing it with sophisticated theoretical models, the authors showed that this flare did indeed originate from an encounter between an unlucky star and an intermediate-mass black hole. The intermediate black hole in question is of particularly low mass—for a black hole, that is—weighing in at roughly 10,000 times the mass of the sun. “The X-ray emissions from the inner disk formed by the debris of the dead star made it possible for us to infer the mass and spin of this black hole and classify it as an intermediate black hole,” Wen said. Dozens of tidal disruption events have been seen in the centers of large galaxies hosting supermassive black holes, and a handful have also been observed in the centers of small galaxies that might contain intermediate black holes. However, past data has never been detailed enough to prove that an individual tidal disruption flare was powered by an intermediate black hole. “Thanks to modern astronomical observations, we know that the centers of almost all galaxies that are similar to or larger in size than our Milky Way host central supermassive black holes,” said study co-author Nicholas Stone, a senior lecturer at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. “These behemoths range in size from 1 million to 10 billion times the mass of our sun, and they become powerful sources of electromagnetic radiation when too much interstellar gas falls into their vicinity.” The mass of these black holes correlates closely with the total mass of their host galaxies; the largest galaxies host the largest supermassive black holes. “We still know very little about the existence of black holes in the centers of galaxies smaller than the Milky Way,” said co-author Peter Jonker of Radboud University and SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research, both in the Netherlands. “Due to observational limitations, it is challenging to discover central black holes much smaller than 1 million solar masses.” Despite their presumed abundance, the origins of supermassive black holes remain unknown, and many different theories currently vie to explain them, according to Jonker. Intermediate-mass black holes could be the seeds from which supermassive black holes grow. “Therefore, if we get a better handle of how many bona fide intermediate black holes are out there, it can help determine which theories of supermassive black hole formation are correct,” he said. Even more exciting, according to Zabludoff, is the measurement of J2150’s spin that the group was able to obtain. The spin measurement holds clues as to how black holes grow, and possibly to particle physics. This black hole has a fast spin, but not the fastest possible spin, Zabludoff explained, begging the question of how the black hole ends up with a spin in this range. “It’s possible that the black hole formed that way and hasn’t changed much since, or that two intermediate-mass black holes merged recently to form this one,” she said. “We do know that the spin we measured excludes scenarios where the black hole grows over a long time from steadily eating gas or from many quick gas snacks that arrive from random directions.” In addition, the spin measurement allows astrophysicists to test hypotheses about the nature of dark matter, which is thought to make up most of the matter in the universe. Dark matter may consist of unknown elementary particles not yet seen in laboratory experiments. Among the candidates are hypothetical particles known as ultralight bosons, Stone explained. “If those particles exist and have masses in a certain range, they will prevent an intermediate-mass black hole from having a fast spin,” he said. “Yet J2150’s black hole is spinning fast. So, our spin measurement rules out a broad class of ultralight boson theories, showcasing the value of black holes as extraterrestrial laboratories for particle physics.” In the future, new observations of tidal disruption flares might let astronomers fill in the gaps in the black hole mass distribution, the authors—whose paper is in —hope. “If it turns out that most dwarf galaxies contain intermediate-mass black holes, then they will dominate the rate of stellar tidal disruption,” Stone said. “By fitting the X-ray emission from these flares to theoretical models, we can conduct a census of the intermediate-mass black hole population in the universe,” Wen added. To do that, however, more tidal disruption events have to be observed. That’s why astronomers hold high hopes for new telescopes coming online soon, both on Earth and in space, including the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, also known as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, or LSST, which is expected to discover thousands of tidal disruption events per year.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/black-hole-snacks-on-a-star/
"Listening to just 30 seconds of Mozart calms areas of the brain and can prevent seizures in people with medication-resistant epilepsy, reveals a new study. Researchers found the might have the power reduce the epilepsy-associated electrical activity spikes in the brain. People who enjoyed the piece of classical music were noted to have substantial increases to its therapeutic effects, the findings discovered. The piece for “four hands,” written in 1781, first came to the fore in the early 1990s when a study found listening to the Mozart sonata led to an increase in spatial reasoning ability. This result, which became known as the Mozart Effect, was studied in a range of fields over the past decades—including epilepsy. In this study, the researchers used electroencephalograms on 16 adults with medication-resistant epilepsy as they listened to a series of 15 or 90 second clips—including the Mozart piece. Listening to , but not any other music clip, was linked with a 66.5 percent average reduction in the number of epilepsy-associated electrical activity spikes throughout the brain. These reductions were found to the greatest extent in the brain’s left and right frontal coertices, parts of the brain involved in regulating emotional responses. Mozart’s sole sonata for two pianos was written at the age of 25 for Josepha von Auernhammer—one of his most promising students—who went on to become one of Austria’s leading female performing pianists and composers. The findings were published in the journal . ( to the famous Mozart song in the video below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/mozart-sonata-calms-the-brains-of-people-with-epilepsy/
"Making a connection on the dating app Tinder can lead to anything from a casual hookup to a lifetime commitment. For one lucky couple, a fateful swipe led not only to true love but to a second chance at a happy, healthy life together. Reid Alexander was diagnosed with the genetic kidney disease Alport syndrome at age 17. By the time he graduated college, his symptoms had progressed to the point that his kidneys were only functioning at 20% capacity. Alexander began dialysis and was put on the transplant list, however, determined not to let the illness rule his life, the Kokomo, Indiana native went forward with plans to move from his home state to Denver, Colorado. He’d only been resettled for a little while when he and Rafael Dìaz—the man who would eventually become both his future husband and kidney donor—met via Tinder. “We really just hit it off,” Alexander told . “And we were together every day ever since. It felt like we knew each other for a really long time. And it still feels like that to us.” Alexander was upfront with Dìaz about his medical prognosis. His new Prince Charming took the news in his stride. Already a registered organ donor, Dìaz began investigating what it would take to learn if he and Alexander were a donor match as well as a love match. Their engagement announcement was followed a few months later by news that Dìaz was indeed a viable donor for Alexander’s kidney transplant. Rather than a lavish wedding ceremony, the couple opted to pool their resources to finance the lifesaving surgical procedure. Alexander and Dìaz got hitched in a small ceremony this past April; the transplant went off without a hitch in June. Both men are extremely grateful not only to have found one another but to have participated in what amounts to something of a real-life miracle. “Expect the unexpected,” Alexander told PEOPLE. “I never would’ve thought that I would move across the country and meet the love of my life, and then the love of my life would also be a perfect match, and I would get a kidney.

"A lot of work is being done in the fields of CRISPR gene-editing, and recently the revolutionary therapy was used to partially restore the vision in patients with a rare genetic disorder. 55-year-old Carlene Knight is now able to move around her call center office without the aid of her walking stick, easily locate objects, and can see colors much more vividly now. 43-year-old Michael Kalberer also learned he could see colors again while on the dancefloor of his cousin’s wedding, and he has gradually regained some of the peripheral field of vision. They were two of seven patients who received CRISPR injected directly into their eye, a procedural method never before done with CRISPIR, which normally involves removing cells, editing them , and injecting them back where they were found. Both patients are far from cured of their Leber congenital amaurosis, or LCA, a rare mutation in the retina, but they’re no longer legally blind, and while the treatment failed to work for some patients during the three- and nine-month followups, no side effects were reported. “I’ve always loved colors,” said Knight, who lives near Portland. “Since I was a kid it’s one of those things I could enjoy with just a small amount of vision. But now I realize how much brighter they were as a kid because I can see them a lot more brilliantly now; it’s just amazing.” Mark Pennesi, a professor of ophthalmology holding an MD and a Ph.D. from the Baylor College of Medicine, presented the results at a recent symposium, calling it “a really amazing technology and very powerful,” . Like all scientists, Pennesi urges caution, as a lot more follow-up research needs to be conducted before the true value of the CRISPR trial can be measured. However, the early success was so significant and clear for people like Knight and Kalberer, the researchers are already moving on to the next group of patients. CRISPR works by injecting harmless viruses taught to carry edited genes into the retina, where cells cannot be removed, thus facilitating the approach. To ensure the highly-experimental treatment wouldn’t ruin what limited vision the patients did have, only one eye received the injection, and doses were varied. The fact that some patients didn’t regain any vision could have been the dose size, or the limit to the single retina. Pennesi believes some may continue to improve even after nine months as a matter of course, while the brain begins to gradually figure out what to do with all these extra images. CRISPR has been used to treat , , and even to to the Australian box jellyfish sting, and the number of potential uses for CRISPR could be huge if it’s shown safe to apply as genetic disorders inherent to organs that are difficult to draw samples from, such as the brain, could be approached. “We’re thrilled to see early signs of efficacy because that means gene editing is working. This is the first time we’re having evidence that gene editing is functioning inside somebody and it’s improving—in this case—their visual function,” said Dr. Eric Pierce, another professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School who’s assisting with the trials.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/crispr-gene-editing-experiment-partly-restores-vision-in-legally-blind-patients/
"The inventor of a hand-cranked washing machine has traveled to Iraq to distribute the low-cost device to refugees. Navjot Sawhney created the ‘Divya’ to allow those living in poverty to be able to wash their clothes more easily. It is thought around 70 percent of the world’s population does not have access to electric washing machines. The machines are created in the UK and sent to those without access to electricity and water, who would otherwise need to wash clothes by hand. Former Bath University student Navjot told the BBC the two-week trip to northern Iraq to hand out the machines has been a “completely humbling experience.” “To give them the dignity of clean clothes is very fulfilling,” he said. “Some of these families still have members missing, some of these women have suffered major trauma and abuse. It’s just really heartbreaking stuff. “Handwashing clothes is restrictive and painful. The Divya means women, who are usually the primary washers, have more time to rest.” Navjot was inspired to create the machine after witnessing the struggles of his neighbour while volunteering in India, after quitting his engineering job in Wiltshire. “When you read the news, places like this can seem really daunting but the people here are like everyone else in the world,” he said. “They just want their lives to go back to normal. “This is my third trip to Iraq and each time I come it is unique and I learn so much. Every time I’m reminded of the dignity and pride people have in clean clothes.” The engineer set up the Washing Machine Project in 2018 and it now has orders from 15 countries around the world. He is working towards rolling the device out in Uganda, India, Lebanon, and Jordan. “We’re really proud to be here to do our part.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-inventor-of-a-hand-cranked-washing-machine-iraq/
"Adults can learn a second language as fast as children, reports a new study—and it’s only the conditions in which a child learns a second language that’s given kids a reputation as such fast learners. This means that adults can develop the increased neural connections typical of bilingual individuals that can, by themselves, stave off dementia by four years, as well as make traveling a heck of a lot easier. For children, learning a second language increases the number of , and more rapidly breaks down and rebuilds existing pathways with more conceptual capacity. This translates at home and in the classroom to better memory, increased focus, reduced vulnerability to distractions, and even earlier aptitudes at multi-tasking. Beyond that, it gives parents more reason to dive into a second language as part of a family effort, as further research has shown learning a language as a family improves everyone’s abilities and gives opportunities for learning that are mostly absent from classroom settings. Many studies have shown that children’s propensity for learning a second language far exceeds that of adults, but recent research from the University of Kansas’ department of linguistics has demonstrated that’s not necessarily true. In an examination of Spanish second-language learners, that after minimal training, the brain activity between sentences that relied on grammatical features unique to each language resembled that of native speakers. In other words, the brain activity within an English speaker saying, writing, and reading: “Las flores son hermosas,” or “the flowers are beautiful,” is identical to that found in the brain of a Spanish speaker, despite the fact that this target sentence uses grammatical features not found in English, such as gender and number agreements. “I think it’s cause for optimism for university foreign language instruction. It shows that, even with limited exposure in the college classroom, learning can happen quite quickly and efficiently,” KU linguistics professor Alison Gabriele, the co-author of the paper, to Language Magazine. Another study published in the that adults aged forty and children responded exactly the same to explicit language-learning instruction, reinforcing the hypothesis stated earlier that it’s the environment in which the child and the adult learn that has created the difference. In my experience, teaching English to children in China, and also speaking Italian at a fluent level, children learn by playing games, watching videos, and switching between listening, writing, reading, and speaking. The emphasis on the class is often about fun, or at least takes place in a relaxed setting. Adults on the other hand tend to learn languages in more traditionally academic ways, as well as being much more susceptible to fear of making mistakes. Learning a language as a family, then, improves the level of immersion needed to truly grasp a second language, as it brings the learning methods which characterize the perception of children’s more rapid development into the home for the benefit of the adults as well. National Geographic in an interview with Christine Jernigan, author of that as far as immersion goes, practicing a second language with people is the most important aspect, and who talks to each other more than a family? Language learners need to be brave and ready to make mistakes and receive feedback. Most people will be far more comfortable making mistakes around family members than in a classroom setting. Furthermore, any home activity, whether that’s gardening, playing in the yard, watching movies, going shopping, cleaning, or cooking a meal, becomes an opportunity for language learning. Jernigan recommends preparing vocabulary before an activity and using it as short coursework. Going shopping? Make the list in your target language. Playing board games? Use the target language to explain the rules. Tending to the garden? Make signs for every plant in the target language. Family movie night? Watch the movie in your target language; Jernigan recommends using subtitles too, so you can see which words are being used. A language is also about writing, so try and exchange text messages in the target language for a day, or for a week. If a family is trying to take the learning to a higher level, join a speaking group at a community center or university, where one can meet other people in the area practicing the target language. Learning a second language is one of the three most common New Years resolutions in America, and now this research essentially removes the major barrier to entry: the idea that if you’re older than 16, you’ve missed your chance.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/tips-to-learning-a-second-language-as-a-family/
"Simply by adding sugar, researchers from the Monash Energy Institute have created a longer-lasting, lighter, more sustainable rival to the lithium-ion batteries that are essential for aviation, electric vehicles, and submarines. The Monash team, assisted by CSIRO, report that using a glucose-based additive on the positive electrode they have managed to stabilize lithium-sulfur battery technology, long touted as the basis for the next generation of batteries. “In less than a decade, this technology could lead to vehicles including electric buses and trucks that can travel from Melbourne to Sydney without recharging. It could also enable innovation in delivery and agricultural drones where light weight is paramount,” says lead author Professor Mainak Majumder, from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Associate Director of the Monash Energy Institute. In theory, lithium-sulfur batteries could store two to five times more energy than lithium-ion batteries of the same weight. The problem has been that, in use the electrodes deteriorated rapidly, and the batteries broke down. There were two reasons for this—the positive sulfur electrode suffered from substantial expansion and contraction weakening it and making it inaccessible to lithium, and the negative lithium electrode became contaminated by sulfur compounds. Last year the Monash team demonstrated they could open the structure of the sulfur electrode to accommodate expansion and make it more accessible to lithium. Now, by incorporating sugar into the web-like architecture of the electrode they have stabilized the sulfur, preventing it from moving and blanketing the lithium electrode. Test-cell prototypes constructed by the team have been shown to have a charge-discharge life of at least 1000 cycles, while still holding far more capacity than equivalent lithium-ion batteries. “So each charge lasts longer, extending the battery’s life,” says first author and PhD student Yingyi Huang. “And manufacturing the batteries doesn’t require exotic, toxic, and expensive materials.” Yingyi and her colleagues were inspired by a 1988 geochemistry report that describes how sugar-based substances resist degradations in geological sediments by forming strong bonds with sulfides. Dr Mahdokht Shaibani, second author of the paper, published in , and Monash researcher, says, “While many of the challenges on the cathode side of the battery has been solved by our team, there is still need for further innovation into the protection of the lithium metal anode to enable large-scale uptake of this promising technology—innovations that may be right around the corner.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/monash-sugar-lithium-ion-batteries/

It might show amazing fall colors happened in the middle of Arizona, but if there are no deciduous trees in that area—of course there won’t be much of a show. “I wish I could make fall happen in South Florida or in the desert,” Angotti told the , “but at the end of the day, the math is basically showing when the temperature and precipitation trends cause peak fall to occur in each of these areas.” So just why do leaves change their color? According to SmokyMountains.com, “As the fall days begin to get shorter and shorter, the production of chlorophyll slows to a halt, eventually giving way to the ‘true’ color of the leaf.” When it gets cold, the trees then “slowly close off the veins that carry water and nutrients to and from the leaves with a layer of new cells that form at the base of the leaf stem, protecting the limbs and body of the tree. “Once the process of new cell creation is complete, water and nutrients no longer flow to and from the leaf—this enables the leaf to die and weaken at the stem, eventually falling gracefully to the ground.” We hope it’s beautiful where you are right now.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/interactive-map-shows-best-fall-colors-usa/

A new survey of 2,000 Americans aged 50 and older found that 45% reported having the best sex of their lives as they’ve aged. In fact, the results showed that one in eight respondents have sex at least five times a week.

"It’s basic exercise knowledge that to gain muscles, you strength train, and to lose fat, you do cardio—right? Not necessarily, a new UNSW study suggests. In fact, the study—a systematic review and meta-analysis that reviewed and analysed existing evidence—shows we can lose around 1.4 percent of our entire body fat through strength training alone, which is similar to how much we might lose through cardio or aerobics. “A lot of people think that if you want to lose weight, you need to go out and run,” says senior author of the study Dr Mandy Hagstrom, exercise physiologist and senior lecturer at UNSW Medicine & Health. “But our findings show that even when strength training is done on its own, it still causes a favorable loss of body fat without having to consciously diet or go running.” Up until now, the link between strength training and fat loss has been unclear. Studies have investigated this link in the past, but their sample sizes tend to be small—a side effect of not many people wanting to volunteer to exercise for months on end. Smaller sample sizes can make it difficult to find statistically significant results, especially as many bodies can respond differently to exercise programs. “It can be really difficult to discern whether there’s an effect or not based on one study alone,” says Dr Hagstrom. “But when we add all of these studies together, we effectively create one large study, and can get a much clearer idea of what’s going on.” Dr Hagstrom and her team pulled together the findings from 58 research papers that used highly accurate forms of body fat measurement (like body scans, which can differentiate fat mass from lean mass) to measure the outcomes from strength training programs. Altogether, the studies included 3000 participants, none of which had any previous weight training experience. While the strength training programs differed between the studies, the participants worked out for roughly 45-60 minutes each session for an average of 2.7 times per week. The programs lasted for about five months. The team found that, on average, the participants lost 1.4 per cent of their total body fat after their training programs, which equated to roughly half a kilo in fat mass for most participants. While the findings are encouraging for fans of pumping iron, Dr Hagstrom says the best approach for people who are aiming to lose fat is still to stick to eating nutritiously and having an exercise routine that includes both aerobic/cardio and strength training. But if aerobics and cardio just aren’t your thing, the good news is you don’t need to force it. “If you want to exercise to change your body composition, you’ve got options,” says Dr Hagstrom. “Do what exercise you want to do and what you’re most likely to stick to.” Part of the reason many people think strength training doesn’t live up to cardio in terms of fat loss comes down to inaccurate ways of measuring fat. For example, many people focus on the number they see on the scale—that is, their total body weight. But this figure doesn’t differentiate fat mass from everything else that makes up the body, like water, bones, and muscles. “More often than not, we don’t gain any muscle mass when we do aerobic training,” says Dr Hagstrom. “We improve our cardiorespiratory fitness, gain other health and functional benefits, and can lose body fat. “But when we strength train, we gain muscle mass lose body fat, so the number on the scales won’t look as low as it would after aerobics training, especially as muscle weighs more than fat.” The research team focused on measuring how much the total body fat percentage—that is, the amount of your body that’s made up of fat mass—changed after strength training programs. This measurement showed fat loss appears to be on par with aerobics and cardio training, despite the different figures on the scales. “A lot of fitness recommendations come from studies that use inaccurate measurement tools, like bioelectrical impedance or scales,” says Dr Hagstrom. “But the most accurate and reliable way of assessing body fat is through DEXA, MRI or CT scans. They can compartmentalize the body and separate fat mass from lean tissue.” While this study didn’t show whether variables like exercise duration, frequency, intensity, or set volume impacted fat loss percentage, the team hope to next investigate whether we strength train can change the amount of fat loss. As part of their study, published in the team conducted a sub-analysis comparing how different ways of measuring fat can influence a study’s findings. Interestingly, it showed that when papers used more accurate measurements like body scans, they tended to show lower overall changes in body fat. “Using accurate fat measurements is important because it gives us a more realistic idea of what body changes to expect,” says lead author of the study Mr Michael Wewege, PhD candidate at UNSW and NeuRA. “Future exercise studies can improve their research by using these more accurate body measurements.” Reframing the way we measure progress doesn’t just apply to sports researchers, but to everyday people, too. “Resistance training does so many fantastic things to the body that other forms of exercise don’t, like improving bone mineral density, lean mass, and muscle quality. Now, we know it also gives you a benefit we previously thought only came from aerobics,” says Dr Hagstrom. “If you’re strength training and want to change how your body looks, then you don’t want to focus on the number on the scale too much, because it won’t show you all your results. “Instead, think about your whole body composition, like how your clothes fit and how your body will start to feel, and move, differently.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/strength-training-can-burn-fat-just-like-cardio-myth-busting-study-finds/
"Our partner Rob Brezsny provides his weekly wisdom to enlighten our thinking and motivate our mood. Rob’s , is a syndicated weekly column appearing in over a hundred publications. He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Being “nude,” said art critic Kenneth Clark, has “no uncomfortable overtone,” but indicates “a balanced, prosperous, and confident body.” I bring this to your attention because I believe you would benefit from experiencing extra nudity and no nakedness in the days ahead. If you choose to take on this assignment, please use it to upgrade your respect and reverence for your beauty. PS: Now is also a favorable time to express your core truths without inhibition or apology. I urge you to be your pure self in all of your glory. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Scorpio poet wrote, “One has to get their own animal out of their own cage and not look for either an animal keeper or an unlocker.” That’s always expert advice, but it will be extra vital for you to heed in the coming weeks. The gorgeous semi-wild creature within you needs more room to run, more sights to see, more adventures to seek. For that to happen, it needs to spend more time outside of its cage. And you’re the best person to make sure that happens. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Sagittarian composer (1770–1827) could be a marvelous friend. If someone he cared for was depressed or feeling lost, he would invite them to sit in his presence as he improvised music on the piano. There were no words, no advice—only emotionally stirring melodies. “He said everything to me,” one friend said about his gift. “And finally gave me consolation.” I invite you to draw inspiration from his example, Sagittarius. You’re at the peak of your powers to provide solace, comfort, and healing to allies who need such nurturing. Do it in whatever way is also a blessing for you. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): At age 23, Capricorn-born (1721–1764) became French King Louis XV’s favorite mistress. She was not born into aristocracy, but she wielded her Capricornian flair with supreme effectiveness. Ultimately, she achieved a noble title as well as high prestige and status in the French court. As is true for evolved Capricorns, her elevated role was well-deserved, not the result of vulgar social-climbing. She was a patron of architecture, porcelain artwork, and France’s top intellectuals. She ingratiated herself to the King’s wife, the Queen, and served as an honored assistant. I propose we make her your role model for the next four weeks. May she inspire you to seek a boost in your importance and clout that’s accomplished with full integrity. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): The bad news is that artist Debbie Wagner was diagnosed with two brain tumors in 2002. The good news is that surgery not only enabled her to survive, but enhanced her visual acuity. The great news is that on most days since 2005, she has painted a new image of the sunrise. I invite you to dream up a ritual to celebrate your own victory over adversity, Aquarius. Is there a generous gesture or creative act you could do on a semi-regular basis to thank life for providing you with the help and power you needed? PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): A self-described “witch” named Lars wrote, “I am a ghost from the 1750s, and my life is currently in the hands of a group of suburban 13-year-olds using a ouija board to ask me if Josh from homeroom has a crush on them.” He’s implying that a powerful supernatural character like himself is being summoned to do tasks that are not worthy of him. He wishes his divinatory talents were better used. Are there any resemblances between you and him, Pisces? Do you ever feel as if you’re not living up to your promise? That your gifts are not being fully employed? If so, I’m pleased to predict that you could fix this problem in the coming weeks and months. You will have extra energy and savvy to activate your full potential. ARIES (March 21-April 19): Blogger AnaSophia was asked, “What do you find attractive in a person?” I’ll reproduce her reply because it’s a good time to think about what your answer would be. I’m not implying you should be looking for a new lover. I’m interested in inspiring you to ruminate about what alliances you should cultivate during the coming months. Here’s what AnaSophia finds attractive: “strong desire but not neediness, passionate sensitivity, effortlessness, authenticity, innocence of perception, sense of humor, vulnerability and honesty, embodying one’s subtleties and embracing one’s paradoxes, acting unconditionally and from the heart.” TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Taurus author confessed, “Sometimes I want greatness, sometimes just its shadow.” I appreciate his honesty. I think what he says is true about most of us. Is there anyone who is always ready for the heavy responsibility of pursuing greatness? Doubtful. To be great, we must periodically go through phases when we recharge our energy and take a break from being nobly ambitious. What about you, dear Taurus? If I’m reading the omens correctly, you will benefit from a phase of reinvention and reinvigoration. During the next three weeks, you’ll be wise to hang out in the shadows of greatness. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): “Have fun, even if it’s not the same kind of fun everyone else is having,” wrote religious writer C. S. Lewis. That advice is ten times more important right now than it usually is. For the sake of your body’s and soul’s health, you need to indulge in sprees of playful amusement and blithe delight and tension-relieving merriment. And all that good stuff will work its most potent magic if it stimulates pleasures that are unique to you—and not necessarily in line with others’ tastes. CANCER (June 21-July 22): “It is one thing to learn about the past,” wrote Cancerian journalist Kenneth Auchincloss. “It is another to wallow in it.” That’s stellar advice for you to incorporate in the coming weeks. After studying your astrological omens, I’m enthusiastic about you exploring the old days and old ways. I’m hoping that you will discover new clues you’ve overlooked before and that this further information will inspire you to re-envision your life story. But as you conduct your explorations, it’s also crucial to avoid getting bogged down in sludgy emotions like regret or resentment. Be inspired by your history, not demoralized by it. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Would you like to deepen and strengthen your capacity to concentrate? Cosmic rhythms will conspire in your favor if you work on this valuable skill in the coming weeks. You’ll be able to make more progress than would normally be possible. Here’s pertinent advice from author Harriet Griffey: “Whenever you feel like quitting, just do five more—five more minutes, five more exercises, five more pages—which will extend your focus.” Here’s another tip: Whenever you feel your concentration flagging, remember what it is you love about the task you’re doing. Ruminate about its benefits for you and others. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): What’s your favorite feeling? Here’s Virgo poet Mary Szybist’s answer to that question: hunger. She’s not speaking about the longing for food, but rather the longing for everything precious, interesting, and meaningful. She adores the mood of “not yet,” the experience of moving toward the desired thing. What would be your response to the question, Virgo? I’m guessing you may at times share Szybist’s perspective. But given the current astrological omens, your favorite feeling right now may be utter satisfaction—the gratifying sensation of getting what you’ve hungered for. I say, trust that intuition.

"Desde peces volviendo a los canales de Venecia hasta venados en las calles de Londres, muchas de las órdenes de aislamiento y restricciones sociales como medidas de prevención ante el coronavirus han permitido a la naturaleza volver a los lugares menos esperados. Tailandia es la nación más reciente en ocupar los titulares ante este fenómeno, después de que el gobierno de dicho país puso restricciones a los vuelos internacionales y varias medidas para que los ciudadanos se mantuvieran en sus hogares. Aunque el virus ha afectado la economía turística de Tailandia, en 2020 surgió una época de paz y salvación para las tortugas laúd. Una especie en peligro de extinción en el sudeste asiático, comenzaron a anidar allí por primera vez en cinco años. Son la especie de tortugas marinas más grandes, ahora las tortugas laúd tienen 11 nidos en las playas tailandesas, más de lo que se ha registrado en cualquier otra estación del año en las últimas dos décadas. “Esta es una muy buena señal para nosotros, porque las tortugas tienen un alto riesgo de morir a causa de los artículos de pesca y de los humanos dañando las playas.” dijo el director del centro de Biología Marina de Phuket a The Guardian. En Florida, el número de nidos de tortugas laúd ha incrementado dramáticamente desde el año pasado. La playa Juno es la ubicación con mayor densidad de nidos en todo el mundo, con un estimado de 21,000 el año anterior, número que proviene de varias especies. Con tan solo dos 2 semanas en la temporada de verano del anidación del 2020, personal del Centro de Vida Marina Loggerhead encontraron y delimitaron 76 lugares de anidación de tortugas laúd, un incremento significativo comparado con el año anterior en la longitud de 15.28km de playa. Sin perros ni personas caminando cerca o sobre los nidos, exponiendo los huevos, hay una mayor oportunidad de que los huevos sobre vivan los 60 días antes de día del nacimiento. “Nuestras tortugas laúd están viviendo con fuerza este año. Estamos emocionados de ver a nuestras tortugas prosperar en este medio ambiente,” le dijo Sarah Hirsch al noticiero WPEC-TV de West Palm Beach. “Nuestro mundo a cambiado, pero estas tortugas han estado haciendo esto por millones de años y es reconfortante y nos esperanza ver como el mundo sigue.” Para el final de la estación de anidamiento, si los números continúan incrementando, podría ser de gran ayuda para las especies vulnerables.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/enorme-en-anidacion-de-tortugasen-tailandia-y-florida/
"Mil millones de años de movimientos geológicos de la Tierra se han resumido en un video de 40 segundos, en el que los continentes y océanos revolotean como mariposas amorosas mientras demuestran cuán móvil es realmente la superficie de la Tierra. La historia de la tectónica de placas, el deslizamiento y deslizamiento de la corteza terrestre y los continentes, ha tenido lugar durante miles de millones de años a velocidades entre la tasa de crecimiento de las uñas (40 mm por año) y del cabello (160 mm por año). El demuestra no sólo cuánto se suman los milímetros con el tiempo, sino que retrata una teoría en la evolución de la Tierra, desde el período supercontinente de Gondwana hace 540 a 320 millones de años, hasta la configuración moderna, el Aparente Polar Wander, en el que la mayoría las masas de tierra se han arrastrado hacia el Polo Sur antes de condensarse en un punto central y volver a subir juntas como si fueran forzadas a través de un embudo. El coautor del , el Dr. Michael Tetley de la Universidad de Sydney, dijo a Euronews: “Por primera vez se ha construido un modelo completo de tectónica, incluidos todos los límites”. “En una escala de tiempo humana, las cosas se mueven en centímetros por año, pero como podemos ver en la animación, los continentes han estado en todas partes en el tiempo. Un lugar como la Antártida que hoy vemos como un lugar frío, helado e inhóspito, en realidad alguna vez fue un buen destino de vacaciones en el ecuador”, agregó. La teoría principal que explica el desplazamiento de estos continentes es que, como una tapa de alcantarilla flotando sobre un torrente de agua en una calle inundada, la corteza terrestre es mucho más rígida y tiene más resistencia mecánica que la astenosfera debajo de ella. A medida que la roca caliente y quebradiza se desplaza en la astenosfera más débil, su movimiento a través de la parte inferior de la litosfera crea una presión que hace que esta última se mueva. A medida que las placas tectónicas que forman la litosfera se mueven, el desgarro indiscriminado y el choque entre sí crean algunas de las características más dramáticas de nuestro planeta, como cadenas montañosas, volcanes, trincheras y plataformas submarinas e incluso océanos. : El coautor, el Dr. Sabin de la Universidad de Sydney, dijo en un : “El planeta Tierra es increíblemente dinámico, con la superficie compuesta de ‘placas’ que constantemente se empujan entre sí de una manera única entre los planetas rocosos conocidos. Estas placas se mueven a la velocidad de crecimiento de las uñas, pero cuando mil millones de años se condensan en 40 segundos, se revela una danza fascinante”. “Los océanos se abren y se cierran, los continentes se dispersan y se recombinan periódicamente para formar inmensos supercontinentes”, añade. Zahirovic y sus compañeros de equipo esperan que el modelo que han creado ayude a los científicos planetarios en todo tipo de investigación, desde predecir dónde se producirá el aumento del nivel del mar con mayor fuerza hasta predecir dónde se pueden encontrar grandes depósitos de cobre.

"Un mapa interactivo en línea permite marcar la dirección de tu casa y superponer la geografía global de épocas pasadas para ver cómo ha cambiado la tierra durante 750 millones de años. Ver los resultados puede ser muy sorprendente. Hace 600 millones de años, por ejemplo, cuando la vida multicelular recién comenzaba a emerger en el océano, la capital estadounidense de Washington DC se estrelló contra la costa de África occidental como parte de una bola de tierra desordenada que se extendía hasta el Polo Sur, lo que eventualmente se separan, se alejan y forman las Américas. El proyecto, hecho con mucha dedicación por el paleontólogo Ian Webster, es una emocionante herramienta de mapas que permite a los usuarios ingresar a la mayoría de los pueblos, ciudades y países en una barra de búsqueda, donde le mostrará aproximadamente dónde se encontraba la tierra a lo largo de 750 millones de años calendario. El proyecto está adjunto a la más grande del mundo, también creada por Webster, quien se basó en datos geográficos de otro recurso llamado Tierra Antigua ( ). Creado por el paleógrafo Christopher Scotese, Ancient Earth fue la culminación de un trabajo de 30 años en desarrollo llamado Proyecto Mapas Paleo (Paleo Maps Project). La página web se muestra con una variedad de herramientas que le permiten obtener información interesante o seleccionar un período de tiempo en función de la aparición de características específicas, como la primera flor que floreció en la Tierra. Dado que Webster es un experto en dinosaurios, cualquier ubicación que ingrese en la función de búsqueda también le proporcionará una lista de dinosaurios que habrían sido sus vecinos, todos con enlaces en línea al perfil de ese dinosaurio en particular en la base de datos de Webster; en general, representa un recurso educativo increíble para niños y adultos interesados en la paleontología o la geografía. : Incluso con la tecnología GPS moderna y programas como Google Maps, los globos terráqueos y los mapas de papel bidimensionales siguen dando forma a nuestra percepción de la esfera que llamamos Tierra. Un gran ejemplo de nuestra dependencia de los mapas es la palabra china para China: “Reino Medio”. Esta percepción de que China es el punto medio entre el cielo y la Tierra se refleja en los mapas chinos, donde es el Océano Pacífico el que ocupa las áreas centrales de la derecha en lugar del Atlántico, y donde Asia y África obstruyen el lado izquierdo con los otros continentes situados a la derecha. Otro ejemplo se puede encontrar en mapas fechados en la década de 1980 o antes, cuando dada la importancia del hemisferio norte para la mayoría de los estudiosos, el ecuador se colocó a 10 grados de longitud norte, haciendo que los continentes del hemisferio sur parecieran más pequeños. Ancient Earth es lo último en herramientas educativas que cambian de perspectiva, especialmente para los niños, ya que pueden ver cómo sus propios hogares se mueven en la danza tectónica que ha estado ocurriendo durante miles de millones de años. “Me sorprende que los geólogos recopilaran datos suficientes para trazar mi casa hace 750 [millones] de años, así que pensé que todos ustedes también lo disfrutarían”, escribió Webster en un comentario para . “Obviamente, nunca podremos demostrar la exactitud”, concluye Webster. “En mis pruebas encontré que los resultados del modelo pueden variar significativamente.

Imposing these external ideals or concepts onto how we live our own lives, raise our kids, or manage our business, can often mean we are leading someone else’s life. Redefining things like happiness, wealth, and success—as oriented through our own compass—is the ultimate way we can live our best life. “Scarcity economics teaches us that it’s a race—it’s a race to get there first, to have the highest score, to achieve the most, to learn the most first—and we have that same problem around how we treat ourselves and it’s why we have this overwork epidemic.” Holding a Ph.D. in sustainable agriculture, and the record for the most swimming holes visited in a single day in her home of rural West Fulton, New York, Shannon Hayes is the owner of and is the host of podcast, a weekly exploration of the adventures of keeping life, business, family, community, and fun in balance.

"Human society is filled with value, and we can place value on almost any object or opportunity. Viewing the financial system through the lens of permaculture, Ethan Rolland identifies which, when contemplated as a whole, gives us a clearer understanding of our net worth—not just in dollars. We can all learn to utilize our eight forms of capital, our unique currencies: financial, material, living, social, intellectual, experiential, spiritual, and cultural. Using the analogy of an ecosystem, Ethan says, “Your capital isn’t necessarily a currency. Capital is the root, and currency is the derivative we use to exchange… By exercising capital, you extract a currency that then complexes to a real thing or effect in the world… So with social capital, the currency is connections. It complexes to influence and relationships.” A well-known expert in permaculture, homesteading, and general self-reliance, works to provide every possible resource for those looking to increase their self-reliance, whether that’s building a homemade aquaculture pond in your backyard, learning how to link up with local farmers and artisans, or how to become an expert at foraging for wild plants and mushrooms.

"“Life is a practice in improv,” says a Quebec college senior who won a scholarship for her candid musings on the theme ‘How the coronavirus affected my final semester.’ The contest, sponsored by greatergood.org, invited high school and college seniors to record a selfie video that answers the question: How did the coronavirus change your senior year? Participants included 379 students worldwide in 49 countries, but it was a 19-year-old film student who stole the hearts of judges in The “Class of 2020” Challenge. Graduating from John Abbott College, April Judd used humor and creative edits to depict what life was like moving back in with her family and missing the chance to say goodbye to all her friends at the arts college. Her inspiring message details how the class of 2020 can use this experience to their advantage and “mold the universe into the future they want to see”. The pandemic of crisis actually caused April to see the beauty in what our world is going through. “I don’t want to go back to the way things were… I want to have a heightened appreciation for all the things that make life full.” : The Shawville, Quebec graduate told GNN, “In the chaos that our world is experiencing right now, it’s really easy to get caught up in the negative.” “Listening to other people’s submissions and hearing about the unique experiences other girls have gone through this year as graduates is inspiring.” “We are all, truly, in this together and we are all capable of change and growth that can only make this world a better place,” she added. : Patricia Cogley, Director of GreaterGood.org’s Girls’ Voices media training program, which is active in 20 countries and hosted the contest, said: “For many college and high-school seniors in the graduating class of 2020, the coronavirus pandemic has dramatically changed their final year.

"Over 600 square-miles of ancient rainforest with rivers, waterfalls, gorges and white sandy beaches was handed back to the traditional people who had lived here for generations. The historic announcement last week came from officials in Queensland, Australia, who transferred management of the world-famous Daintree National Park to the Eastern Kuku Yalanji people, who are one of the world’s oldest living cultures. “This agreement recognizes their right to own and manage their country, to protect their culture, and to share it with visitors as they become leaders in the tourism industry,” said Environment Minister Meaghan Scanlon. Negotiations over the last 4 years, determined that the world renown Daintree park—a UNESCO World Heritage Area—will eventually be solely and wholly managed by the Eastern Kuku Yalanji. For now, the agreement transfers responsibility for management of Daintree’s 160K hectares, with three other national parks, the Ngalba-bulal, Kalkajaka and the Hope Islands National Parks, to be jointly-managed with the Queensland Government. “Today’s handback marks the government returning more than 3.8 million hectares of land back to Traditional Owners on Cape York, with 2.3 million hectares to be jointly-managed by our rangers and the community,” said Minister Scanlon in a . “It means there are now 32 Aboriginal-owned and jointly-managed national parks on the Cape York Peninsula.” The goal is to provide opportunities for mentoring, training, apprenticeships, work experience and employment to fill positions for land and sea management, hospitality, tourism, and research. : The Daintree borders the Great Barrier Reef, so is one of Australia’s top tourist destinations. “We will also provide funds to develop a tourism hub at Dubudji, first options for contracting on national parks, first rights to consider new tourism proposals, and endeavor to increase the skills and numbers of Jabalbina Indigenous rangers.” Scanlon said Australia has an uncomfortable and ugly shared past, and the handback was a key step on the path towards reconciliation. “These national parks will protect important Aboriginal cultural sites, diverse ecosystems including rainforests, woodlands, wetlands and mangroves, and form part of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area which is recognized as the second most irreplaceable World Heritage site on Earth.” :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/australia-returns-daintree-rainforest-to-its-aboriginal-owners/

"For decades, researchers around the world have searched for ways to use solar power to generate the key reaction for producing hydrogen as a clean energy source—splitting water molecules to form hydrogen and oxygen. However, such efforts have mostly failed because doing it well was too costly, and trying to do it at a low cost led to poor performance. Now, researchers from The University of Texas at Austin have found a low-cost way to solve one half of the equation, using sunlight to efficiently split off oxygen molecules from water. The finding, published recently in Nature Communications, represents a step forward toward greater adoption of hydrogen as a key part of our energy infrastructure. As early as the 1970s, researchers were investigating the possibility of using solar energy to generate hydrogen. But the inability to find materials with the combination of properties needed for a device that can perform the key chemical reactions efficiently has kept it from becoming a mainstream method. “You need materials that are good at absorbing sunlight and, at the same time, don’t degrade while the water-splitting reactions take place,” , a professor in the Cockrell School’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “It turns out materials that are good at absorbing sunlight tend to be unstable under the conditions required for the water-splitting reaction, while the materials that are stable tend to be poor absorbers of sunlight. “These conflicting requirements drive you toward a seemingly inevitable tradeoff, but by combining multiple materials—one that efficiently absorbs sunlight, such as silicon, and another that provides good stability, such as silicon dioxide—into a single device, this conflict can be resolved.” However, this creates another challenge—the electrons and holes created by absorption of sunlight in silicon must be able to move easily across the silicon dioxide layer. This usually requires the silicon dioxide layer to be no more than a few nanometers, which reduces its effectiveness in protecting the silicon absorber from degradation. : The key to this breakthrough came through a method of creating electrically conductive paths through a thick silicon dioxide layer that can be performed at low cost and scaled to high manufacturing volumes. To get there, Yu and his team used a technique first deployed in the manufacturing of semiconductor electronic chips. By coating the silicon dioxide layer with a thin film of aluminum and then heating the entire structure, arrays of nanoscale “spikes” of aluminum that completely bridge the silicon dioxide layer are formed. These can then easily be replaced by nickel or other materials that help catalyze the water-splitting reactions. : When illuminated by sunlight, the devices can efficiently oxidize water to form oxygen molecules while also generating hydrogen at a separate electrode and exhibit outstanding stability under extended operation. Because the techniques employed to create these devices are commonly used in manufacturing of semiconductor electronics, they should be easy to scale for mass production. The team has filed a provisional patent application to commercialize the technology. : Improving the way hydrogen is generated is key to its emergence as a viable fuel source. Most hydrogen production today occurs through heating steam and methane, but that relies heavily on fossil fuels and produces carbon emissions. There is a push toward “green hydrogen” which uses more environmentally friendly methods to generate hydrogen. And simplifying the water-splitting reaction is a key part of that effort. Hydrogen has potential to become an important renewable resource with some unique qualities. It already has a major role in significant industrial processes, and it is starting to show up in the automotive industry. Fuel cell batteries look promising in long-haul trucking, and hydrogen technology could be a boon to energy storage, with the ability to store excess wind and solar energy produced when conditions are ripe for them. : Going forward, the team—which includes Professor Li Ji at Fudan University—will work to improve the efficiency of the oxygen portion of water-splitting by increasing the reaction rate. The researchers’ next major challenge is then to move on to the other half of the equation. “We were able to address the oxygen side of the reaction first, which is the more challenging part,” Yu added, “but you need to perform both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions to completely split the water molecules, so that’s why our next step is to look at applying these ideas to make devices for the hydrogen portion of the reaction.” (SOURCE: )",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/ut-austin-solves-clean-hydrogen-energy-hurdle/
"Last month the Cornish Seal Sanctuary celebrated the 31st birthday of one of their favorite residents—and the team spoiled him with a colorful layered ice cake. The grey seal named Yulelogs is a big favorite among guests. He was rescued as a pup in 1989 by a marine park in the north of England. When the park closed down, Yulelogs was released back into the wild. However, as he had spent such a long time in captivity, he had no idea how to feed himself and had become too attached to humans. Three months after his release, Yulelogs was rescued by the RSPCA after receiving calls from concerned members of the public reporting that he had been chasing people with buckets on the beach, because he thought they contained fish. At the time, he weighed only 132-lbs (60kg), compared to the standard 550-lbs (250kg). Today, Yulelogs is energetic and enthusiastic, especially when it comes to his husbandry training and environmental enrichment, according to the sanctuary. The birthday cake is made of layers of colored ice with a few fish stuck in the top—personally made by the sanctuary. : “It has become a tradition to make a birthday cake for our resident seals as a special treat,” a sanctuary spokesperson, Kayleigh Slowey, told GNN. “And, it wouldn’t be a Log’s birthday celebration without a snooze on top of his cake after all the excitement!” The sanctuary in South West England, run by the nonprofit Sea Life Trust, and you can sponsor “adopt” of their animals if you would like to contribute. :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/rescued-seal-celebrates-birthday-with-ice-cake/
"A new study has found that shade provided by solar panels increased the abundance of flowers under the panels and delayed the timing of their bloom, both findings that could aid the agricultural community. The study, believed to be the first that looked at the impact of solar panels on flowering plants and insects, has important implications for solar developers who manage the land under solar panels, as well as agriculture and pollinator health advocates who are seeking land for pollinator habitat restoration. The findings from Oregon State University are being released at a time when some states, such as Minnesota, North Carolina, Maryland, Vermont and Virginia, have developed statewide guidelines and incentives to promote pollinator-focused solar installations. “The understudy of solar panels is typically managed to limit the growth of plants,” said Maggie Graham, a faculty research assistant at Oregon State and lead author of the paper. “My thought coming into this research was can we flip that? Why not plant under solar arrays with something beneficial to the surrounding ecosystem, like flowers that attract pollinators? Would insects even use it? This study demonstrates that the answer is yes.” Pollinating insects aid in the reproduction of 75% of flowering plant species and 35% of crop species globally. In the United States, pollination services to agriculture are valued at $14 billion annually. Habitat for pollinating insects is declining globally as a result of urbanization, agricultural intensification and land development. Changes in global climate can also cause shifts in habitat availability. Meanwhile, solar photovoltaic installation in the U.S. has increased by an average of 48% per year over the past decade, and current capacity is expected to double again over the next five years, the researchers say. The increased demand for solar panels leads to an interest in the field of agrivoltaics, where solar energy production is combined with agricultural production, such as planting agricultural crops or grazing animals, on the same land. Graham works with Chad Higgins, an associate professor in Oregon State’s College of Agricultural Sciences. Higgins recently published a paper that found co-developing land for both solar photovoltaic power and agriculture could provide 20% of total electricity generation in the United States with an investment of less than 1% of the annual U.S. budget. Furthermore, wide-scale installation of agrivoltaic systems could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S—the equivalent of 75,000 cars off the road per year—and the creation of more than 100,000 jobs in rural communities, while minimally impacting crop yield, Higgins found. The new study led by Graham, and published in the journal , was conducted at the 45-acre Eagle Point Solar Plant in Jackson County, Oregon. The research team collected data on pollinator and plant populations during seven, two-day sampling events from June through September 2019. Those corresponded with post-peak bloom times for flowers. Extending bloom times is important for pollinating insects because it provides them food later in the season, the researchers said. The researchers collected data from 48 species of plants and 65 different insect species. The study sites were broken into three categories: full shade plots under solar panels, partial shade plots under solar panels and full sun plots not under panels. Findings included: Floral abundance was greatest in partial shade plots, where 4% more blooms were found compared to full sun and full shade plots. The amount of flower species and the diversity of flowers didn’t differ among the different plots. An average of 3% more pollinating insects in partial shade and full sun plots than in full shade plots. The amount of insect species and the diversity of insects was higher in partial shade and full sun than in full shade. The number of insects per flower didn’t differ among the different plots. “Unused or underutilized lands below solar panels represent an opportunity to augment the expected decline of pollinator habitat,” Graham said. “Near agricultural lands, this also has the potential to benefit the surrounding agricultural community and presents an avenue for future study.” “Solar developers, policy makers, agricultural communities and pollinator health advocates looking to maximize land-use efficiency, biodiversity and pollination services might want to consider pollinator habitat at solar photovoltaic sites as an option.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/solar-panel-shade-late-summer-increase-pollinator-numbers-oregon-state-university/
"Legend has it that Marie Antoinette’s hair turned gray overnight just before her beheading in 1791. Though the legend is inaccurate—hair that has already grown out of the follicle does not change color—a new study from researchers at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons is the first to offer quantitative evidence linking psychological stress to graying hair in people. And while it may seem intuitive that stress can accelerate graying, the researchers were surprised to discover that hair color can be restored when stress is eliminated, a finding that contrasts with a recent study in mice that suggested that stressed-induced gray hairs are permanent. The study has broader significance than confirming age-old speculation about the effects of stress on hair color, says the study’s senior author Martin Picard, associate professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. “Understanding the mechanisms that allow ‘old’ gray hairs to return to their ‘young’ pigmented states could yield new clues about the malleability of human aging in general and how it is influenced by stress,” Picard says. “Our data add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that human aging is not a linear, fixed biological process but may, at least in part, be halted or even temporarily reversed.” “Just as the rings in a tree trunk hold information about past decades in the life of a tree, our hair contains information about our biological history,” Picard says. “When hairs are still under the skin as follicles, they are subject to the influence of stress hormones and other things happening in our mind and body. Once hairs grow out of the scalp, they harden and permanently crystallize these exposures into a stable form.” Though people have long believed that psychological stress can accelerate gray hair, scientists have debated the connection due to the lack of sensitive methods that can precisely correlate times of stress with hair pigmentation at a single-follicle level. Splitting hairs to document hair pigmentation Ayelet Rosenberg, first author on the study and a student in Picard’s laboratory, developed a new method for capturing highly detailed images of tiny slices of human hairs to quantify the extent of pigment loss (graying) in each of those slices. Each slice, about 1/20th of a millimeter wide, represents about an hour of hair growth. “If you use your eyes to look at a hair, it will seem like it’s the same color throughout unless there is a major transition,” Picard says. “Under a high-resolution scanner, you see small, subtle variations in color, and that’s what we’re measuring.” The researchers, whose study was published June 22 , analyzed individual hairs from 14 volunteers. The results were compared with each volunteer’s stress diary, in which individuals were asked to review their calendars and rate each week’s level of stress. The investigators immediately noticed that some gray hairs naturally regain their original color, which had never been quantitatively documented, Picard says. When hairs were aligned with stress diaries by Shannon Rausser, second author on the paper and a student in Picard’s laboratory, striking associations between stress and hair graying were revealed and, in some cases, a reversal of graying with the lifting of stress. “There was one individual who went on vacation, and five hairs on that person’s head reverted back to dark during the vacation, synchronized in time,” Picard says. To better understand how stress causes gray hair, the researchers also measured levels of thousands of proteins in the hairs and how protein levels changed over the length of each hair. Changes in 300 proteins occurred when hair color changed, and the researchers developed a mathematical model that suggests stress-induced changes in mitochondria may explain how stress turns hair gray. “We often hear that the mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, but that’s not the only role they play,” Picard says. “Mitochondria are actually like little antennas inside the cell that respond to a number of different signals, including psychological stress.” The mitochondria connection between stress and hair color differs from that discovered in a recent study of mice, which found that stress-induced graying was caused by an irreversible loss of stem cells in the hair follicle. “Our data show that graying is reversible in people, which implicates a different mechanism,” says co-author Ralf Paus, PhD, professor of dermatology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. “Mice have very different hair follicle biology, and this may be an instance where findings in mice don’t translate well to people.” Reducing stress in your life is a good goal, but it won’t necessarily turn your hair to a normal color. “Based on our mathematical modeling, we think hair needs to reach a threshold before it turns gray,” Picard says. “In middle age, when the hair is near that threshold because of biological age and other factors, stress will push it over the threshold and it transitions to gray. “But we don’t think that reducing stress in a 70-year-old who’s been gray for years will darken their hair or increasing stress in a 10-year-old will be enough to tip their hair over the gray threshold.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/stress-causes-grey-hair-but-it-can-be-reversible-scientists-find/
"What beats a cup of joe in the morning? Nothing after you realize the myriad beneficial health outcomes that are now associated with drinking coffee. For example, a new study from the Universities of Southampton and Edinburgh, published today in found that drinking any type of coffee led to a reduced risk of developing and dying from chronic liver disease, with the benefit peaking at three to four cups per day. Nearly half a million individuals with known coffee consumption levels were examined through data from the UK Biobank. Of all participants , 78% (384,818) consumed ground or instant caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee, while 22% (109,767) did not drink any type of coffee. During the study period, there were 3,600 cases of chronic liver disease, including 301 deaths. Compared to non-coffee drinkers, coffee drinkers had a 21% reduced risk of chronic liver disease, a 20% reduced risk of chronic or fatty liver disease, and a 49% reduced risk of death from chronic liver disease. The maximum benefit was seen in the group who drank ground coffee, which contains high levels of the ingredients kahweol and cafestol, which have been shown to be beneficial against chronic liver disease in animals. Coffee , and by 1991, coffee, like red meat, had made it on the World Health Organization’s list of possible carcinogens. It wasn’t until 2016 that WHO finally removed it from the list, while two years later California passed a law requiring coffee producers to place cancer warning labels on their products, absurdly because scientists and producers alike couldn’t disprove a negative. Yet coffee has been found to actually aid in preventing certain cancers In a from the BBC historians detail that the first recorded use and consumption of coffee beans came from a part of the world most people don’t associate with the plant—Yemen. According to the historians, a Muslim cleric became suspicious of the beans when he observed his goats eating them and displaying hyperactivity. The cleric, upon consuming them himself, wrote that they allowed him to stay up all night praying—a finding that many college students might be able to empathize with. The beans themselves are a mixture of over 1,000 different chemicals, and scientists often struggle to find out which compounds are responsible for the many observed benefits. in its report on coffee that “there is consistent evidence from epidemiologic studies that higher consumption of caffeine is associated with lower risk (24% per 300mgs of caffeine) of developing Parkinson’s Disease. 24% was also the average found in a meta-analysis containing more than 330,000 participants of the reduction in risk of developing depression; once again the higher the number of cups consumed the lower the risk, which was the same pattern when another analysis of cohort studies looked at suicide risk—53% for those who drank 4 or more cups, 45% for those who drank 2-3 cups. Harvard also reported evidence that coffee can help prevent type-2 diabetes, some cancers, Alzheimer’s, and even gallstones. Jitteriness and abnormal heart rate is sometimes cited as a reason to avoid drinking too much coffee, but despite one chemical raising LDL cholesterol particle count, a variety of meta-analyses consisting of hundreds of thousands of people repeatedly demonstrated lower risks for various heart diseases and events like stroke, generally with a low-end of 11% found with decaffeinated coffee, and 25% for caffeinated. in 2019 that coffee stimulates a type of fat production that counteracts the kind leading to obesity. In vitro cells were found to have immediate stimulation in their production of brown fat, a kind of fat cell used to generate body heat in contrast to white fat, which is for storing calories as energy. The results, that coffee stimulates brown fat production, was replicated in humans, leading the researchers at the University of Nottingham to conclude coffee had a role in combating the obesity epidemic. With all these beneficial outcomes, growing in significance with the number of cups consumed, it’s astonishing to think that our culture accidentally and indelibly added one of what appears to be the healthiest beverages on the planet into our society.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/all-of-coffees-beneficial-effects-liver-disease-cancers-obesity/
"When the thing you’re best known for is having great big hair, chopping it off might be considered the ultimate sacrifice, but one generous young man recently turned lopping off his legendary locks into an opportunity to better the lives of others. Kieran Moïse’s impressive Afro, which he’d been growing and nurturing since childhood, surrounded his head like a halo. At 17, he was set to enroll at the United States Air Force Academy—and that of course, would mean a haircut. Rather than lament the loss, Kieran decided to turn the rite of passage into a charity event benefitting two causes to which he feels a deep connection: St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital and Michigan-based Children With Hair Loss, a nonprofit that provides human hair wigs free of charge to kids and young adults suffering from medically related hair loss. “I have been growing my hair out for many years with the goal of donating it to charity. Now that it is time to shave it, I would like to raise $1,000 per inch for St. Jude’s Hospital,” he explained , which launched on May 29. “My hair is 19 inches long and that $19,000 will do so much good to help families dealing with cancer. One of my good friends in middle school died from cancer and I know St. Jude’s really helped his family. This is just one way that I feel like I can give back. It will also help make some really good wigs for kids! Please donate and help me reach my goal!” Kieran’s parents Patrick and Kelly Moïse have chronicled the growth their son’s amazing ’do over the course of his life and understand just how much cutting it off meant to him. “My son has always had a huge heart. He was determined that if he was going to have to get a haircut anyway, then he should pay it forward in a way that would help as many people as possible,” Kelly told the . During an event held at a local Huntsville, Alabama, brewery Kieran submitted to being shorn in front of a crowd of nearly 100 enthusiastic supporters. His lengthy tresses were forwarded to the Michigan charity and to date, he’s raised more than $39,000 in support of cancer research at St. Jude. It’s an impressive sum to be sure, but more than anything, Kieran hopes his “shaving grace” will encourage others to find ways to offer help and hope to those in need. “[Kieran] wants people to know that if he can donate his hair, then anyone can,” Kelly told WaPo. “He’s hoping that everyone will be encouraged to go out there and commit their own small act of kindness.” How’s that for shear inspiration?",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/kieran-moise-afro-charity/
"In the land of endless fossils—aka North China—a new species of giant rhinoceros has been discovered in Gansu Province that ranks among the largest terrestrial mammals to ever walk the Earth. Belonging to an extinct genus called , which means “near the hornless beast,” the new species displays some different characteristics and carries with it a potential migratory pattern that may help to explain modern mammalian distribution. The giant rhino is known to be one of the largest land mammals that ever lived. It has primarily been found in Asia, but its evolutionary relationships remain unclear. Tao Deng and colleagues of giant rhino dubbed , named for the Linxia Basin in northwestern China where it was found. “The fossils were prepared [for study] by three professional technicians under [our] supervision from December 2016 to February 2017,” Dr. Deng told GNN When the perfect specimens appeared in our sight, their huge size and good completeness [gave us] a great surprise.” Deng and his colleagues had been working in the Linxia Basin since the 1980s, but have only found fragments of giant rhino remains. At the shoulder, would have stood 15.7 feet tall, weighing from 15 up to 20 tons, more than the largest African elephant ever recorded. It had a long neck, contributing to its 23 feet in length, that would have supported a skull that itself was as long as a large child. Skulls reveal the creature had a trunk, and two tusk-like incisors, but likely no horn despite the fact that genetics have placed it in the rhinoceros family. Despite its heft, lasted only about 11 million years, far less than other rhinoceros progenitors like . The authors’ analyses place this species in a group with another closely related giant rhino species called which together have a close relationship with the giant rhinos of Pakistan. These findings raise the possibility that the giant rhino could have passed through the Tibetan region before it became the elevated plateau it is today. From there, it may have reached the Indian-Pakistani subcontinent in the Oligocene epoch (between 28 and 23 million years ago), where other giant rhino specimens have been found, and where modern rhinos until recently still lived. This overland route could inform paleontologists of other potential mammal discoveries that, like , passed over the Asian continent during the Oligocene.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/new-giant-rhino-skeleton-found-in-china/

"Waking up just one hour earlier could reduce a person’s risk of major depression by 23%, suggests a sweeping new genetic study. The study of 840,000 people, by researchers at University of Colorado Boulder and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, represents some of the strongest evidence yet that chronotype—a person’s propensity to sleep at a certain time—influences depression risk. It’s also among the first studies to quantify just how much, or little, change is required to influence mental health. As people emerge, post-pandemic, from working and attending school remotely—a trend that has led many to shift to a later sleep schedule—the findings could have important implications. “We have known for some time that there is a relationship between sleep timing and mood, but a question we often hear from clinicians is: How much earlier do we need to shift people to see a benefit?” said senior author Celine Vetter, assistant professor of integrative physiology at CU Boulder. “We found that even one-hour earlier sleep timing is associated with significantly lower risk of depression.” Previous observational studies have shown that night owls are as much as twice as likely to suffer from depression as early risers, regardless of how long they sleep. But because mood disorders themselves can disrupt sleep patterns, researchers have had a hard time deciphering what causes what. Other studies have had small sample sizes, relied on questionnaires from a single time point, or didn’t account for environmental factors which can influence both sleep timing and mood, potentially confounding results. In 2018, Vetter published a large, long term study of 32,000 nurses showing that “early risers” were up to 27% less likely to develop depression over the course of four years, but that begged the question: What does it mean to be an early riser? To get a clearer sense of whether shifting sleep time earlier is truly protective, and how much shift is required, lead author Iyas Daghlas, M.D., turned to data from the DNA testing company 23 and Me and the biomedical database UK Biobank. Daghlas then used a method called “Mendelian randomization” that leverages genetic associations to help decipher cause and effect. “Our genetics are set at birth so some of the biases that affect other kinds of epidemiological research tend not to affect genetic studies,” said Daghlas, who graduated in May from Harvard Medical School. More than 340 common genetic variants, including variants in the so-called “clock gene” PER2, are known to influence a person’s chronotype, and genetics collectively explains 12-42% of our sleep timing preference. The researchers assessed deidentified genetic data on these variants from up to 850,000 individuals, including data from 85,000 who had worn wearable sleep trackers for 7 days and 250,000 who had filled out sleep-preference questionnaires. This gave them a more granular picture, down to the hour, of how variants in genes influence when we sleep and wake up—the results of which have just been published in the journal . In the largest of these samples, about a third of surveyed subjects self-identified as morning larks, 9% were night owls and the rest were in the middle. Overall, the average sleep mid-point was 3 a.m., meaning they went to bed at 11 p.m. and got up at 6 a.m. With this information in hand, the researchers turned to a different sample which included genetic information along with anonymized medical and prescription records and surveys about diagnoses of major depressive disorder. Using novel statistical techniques, they asked: Do those with genetic variants which predispose them to be early risers also have lower risk of depression? The answer is a firm yes. Each one-hour earlier sleep midpoint (halfway between bedtime and wake time) corresponded with a 23% lower risk of major depressive disorder. This suggests that if someone who normally goes to bed at 1 a.m. goes to bed at midnight instead and sleeps the same duration, they could cut their risk by 23%; if they go to bed at 11 p.m., they could cut it by about 40%. It’s unclear from the study whether those who are already early risers could benefit from getting up even earlier. But for those in the intermediate range or evening range, shifting to an earlier bedtime would likely be helpful. What could explain this effect? Some research suggests that getting greater light exposure during the day, which early-risers tend to get, results in a cascade of hormonal impacts that can influence mood. Others note that having a biological clock, or circadian rhythm, that trends differently than most peoples’ can in itself be depressing. “We live in a society that is designed for morning people, and evening people often feel as if they are in a constant state of misalignment with that societal clock,” said Daghlas. He stresses that a large randomized clinical trial is necessary to determine definitively whether going to bed early can reduce depression. “But this study definitely shifts the weight of evidence toward supporting a causal effect of sleep timing on depression.” For those wanting to shift themselves to an earlier sleep schedule, Vetter offers this advice: “Keep your days bright and your nights dark,” she says. “Have your morning coffee on the porch. Walk or ride your bike to work if you can, and dim those electronics in the evening.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/waking-1-hour-earlier-could-cut-depression-risk-university-boulder/

"U.S. prison populations are declining. This is not only attributable to the easing of drug laws across the country, but also in rising standards of living in previously poorer states. The gradual shuttering of prisons in the U.S. has also led to a creativity boom in the form of redesigning old correctional facilities for other purposes. reports that the inmate population in Connecticut has fallen by about half from its peak of 20,000 in 2008, and that while one former prison now locks up only important documents for banks and law firms, others remain empty but unused. Here are a few more of new uses for America’s jails. Gainesville and Alachua County has a new homeless shelter, found within the converted Gainesville Correctional Institute. Shuttered due to budget cuts, locals found the building ideal for converting into a homeless shelter, and got straight to work planting trees and painting the walls bright colors.

Recruiting the discipline and leadership skills of the latter to teach and guide the former, creates an environment whereby at-risk youth who need to fulfill long hours of community service can learn life skills, sustainable farming practices, and animal husbandry, with an opportunity to receive clinical therapy in an environment much more suited to young men. Meanwhile, the veterans work toward university degrees in environmental sciences and sustainable agriculture. Together, these individuals young and old who may have been on the fringes of society work to rehabilitate abandoned brownfields (land that might be contaminated and must be cleaned before future use), and to keeo the prison property decaying into dysfunction.

"Many have daydreamed of winning the lottery—but how about unwittingly having a $1 million win in your hands, then accidentally tossing it out? That waking nightmare happened to Massachusetts’ Lea Rose Fiega. Luckily, the kind store owners where she bought the ticket let her know her mistake. It was back in March that Fiega spent $30 on a scratch-off Diamond Millions ticket from Lucky Stop in Southwick. “I was in a hurry, on lunch break, and just scratched it real quick, and looked at it, and it didn’t look like a winner, so I handed it over to them to throw away,” she told . For 10 days, the ticket simply lay there behind the counter. “One evening, I was going through the tickets from the trash and found out that she didn’t scratch the number,” Abhi Shah, the son of the store’s owners told . “I scratched the number and it was $1 million underneath the ticket.” “We had mixed emotions,” Shah . “We didn’t sleep for two nights, but I don’t know what happened. My inner soul told me: ‘That’s not right. You know who that person is. You should give that ticket back to them.’ And that’s exactly what I did.” Fiega works near the convenience store where she got her ticket—so Shah went over there. He told her his mom and dad would like to see her, so she went over to the store. When she got the news she couldn’t believe what she was hearing. She cried. And then she hugged the entire family. For Fiega, who nearly died of COVID-19 in January, winning the lottery has truly been the (very rich) icing on the cake of what’s been a difficult year. The Diamond Millions store will get $10,000 from the Massachusetts State Lottery commission for selling the winning ticket—and Fiega happily gave the family an additional reward. The rest, she says she’ll save for her retirement.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/lottery-ticket-winner-massachusetts-lea-rose-fiega/
"In a stroke of scientific genius, a German researcher enjoying a box of popcorn in a dark movie theater realized that the overpriced, butter-soaked concession had the exact same size and consistency as Styrofoam packing peanuts. Considering Styrofoam is made from polystyrene, which requires fossil fuel extraction and takes centuries to break down into yet smaller bits of harmful micro-plastic, Alireza Kharazipour thought it was worth experimenting with puffed corn kernels as a replacement for them. Annually, in the U.S. alone, around 3 million tons of polystyrene is produced, which is a lot considering it’s 95% air. It’s a popular choice because it has enabled packaging to take on very precise forms and provides excellent packing safety for fragile electronics on the move, for instance—while costing pennies to manufacture. One of its worst qualities is that most recycling facilities don’t have the capability to process it. “Our popcorn packaging is a great sustainable alternative to polystyrene which is derived from petroleum,” said Stefan Schult, Managing Director of Nordgetreide. “The products are very light because popcorn granules are filled with air like honeycombs,” Kharazipour tells . “When grain maize expands into popcorn, the volume increases by 15% to 20%.” Taking corn waste products produced from making corn flakes, then filling them with steam creates what Kharazipour and his team at Gottingen University call “granulated popcorn.” The popcorn packing can be made from any type of corn, and is completely biodegradable. Large pieces can be compressed into shapes to hold different products, and can be easily sawed into pieces, either for cutting into precise shapes, or for shredding at the end of its life. The brilliance of Kharazipour’s idea has with a medium-sized grain and cereal company in Europe called Nordgetreide for manufacturing various popcorn packing products.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/german-researcher-replaced-polystyrene-packing-peanuts-with-real-packing-popcorn/
"— Bruce Dickinson. It’s not every day GNN starts a story with a quote from an Iron Maiden song, but this line perfectly describes a development that could revolutionize short-distance flight by heralding the return of helium-filled dirigible airships to Europe’s skies. (HAV) are within 4 years of their first-planned commercial flight of the Airlander10—a hybrid-electric airship that produces 75% fewer emissions per mile traveled than a passenger jet. Designed for short hops on oft-taken business trips—like Oslo to Stockholm or Liverpool to Belfast—it offers the Greta Thunbergs of the world a chance to return to the convenience of the air travel. Rigid airships never became the dream that so many scientists, inventors, and fiction writers imagined they would be at the turn of the 20th century. The parallel development of fixed-wing aircraft, and eventually jet-powered flight, paired with the immolation of the Hindenburg, meant that beyond the Goodyear Blimp over football stadiums, the dream of the dirigible never became a reality. But the Airlander10 offers so much of what a passenger jet flight cannot, meaning those dreams have a real chance of becoming reality. With unpressurized cabins made possible by lower flying altitudes, the trip is silent, and with floor-to-ceiling windows all passengers, whether window or aisle, have unimpeded views of the world below and beyond. According to HAV, a jet from Seattle to Vancouver amounts to 55kgs of CO2 per passenger, while an Airlander10 drops that number to about 4.12kgs, less even than rail travel. Furthermore, thanks to the airship’s abilities of vertical takeoff and landing, there’s a significant long-term reduction in CO2 cost from plane/train infrastructure requirements (paving runways or laying rail track isn’t green by any measure). But it’s the that really brings the old European idea of dirigible travel alive again—with luxurious couches, tables, bars, workstations, and food service. HAV told GNN they expect ticket prices to fit within the range of numbers from other modes of transport like planes, trains, and ferries. The company’s short-term goals are to finish legal requirements on the Airlander10, and get their UK factory operational to produce 12 aircraft per year while working towards the all-electric motor outfits which would take the dirigible to zero-emissions, as well as on their Airlander50—designed for air freight transportation. The combination of vertical take off/landing, floor-to-ceiling windows, and silent journey means that HAV is looking to in places like the Arctic, across Africa, where hot-air balloon tours are already common, and among archipelagos. Bruce Dickinson, the lead singer for Iron Maiden and captain of the band’s personal Boeing 757, has invested $380,000 in the company. Perhaps this isn’t a surprise.

"Anchovies and sardines are, as it turns out straight superfoods—especially for kids. Dr. Shakuntala Thilsted was recently awarded the 2021 World Food Prize—described as the Nobel Prize for food and agriculture—for her work integrating small fish into developing nations diets: primarily she focused on this because of the incredible nutrient density of small fish, and the imperative role it plays in brain development in the first 1,000 days of a child’s life, as well as in pregnant and nursing mothers. Anchovies, sardines, and in fact many small fish species are rich in the unsaturated fats omega 3 and 6 also known as EPA and DHA, which are Since sardines only eat plankton, they also contain only very low levels of mercury. There’s also evidence they help prevent aging, and in a variety of organs. They also contain vitamin B12, a nutrient and particularly seafood, but that’s almost absent in all other food groups. B12 deficiency is common in children in the developing world, a challenge that Thilsted sought to tackle with increasing access to smaller fish, which involved a little bit of stigma-breaking, since most consumers would prefer to eat larger fish like tuna, salmon, or carp species. Her work started in Bangladesh, and spans Sierra Leone, Malawi, Cambodia, India, Myanmar, Zambia, and Nepal. One of the principal ways she’s increasing access to small fish is by utilizing a cultural feature of Bangladesh—the backyard “homestead pond.” In an interview with Thilsted explains that since Bangladesh is such a low-lying country, many people choose to build their houses on raised earth. The hole the homeowners dig to acquire the dirt to lift up their property becomes a pond, which they normally stock with larger fish species. There are four million of these homestead ponds in Bangladesh alone according to Thilsted, but she’s also found them in India, Zambia, and Malawi. Small fish are faster growing, and produce more food weight than larger fish traditionally raised in ponds, since their bones, which contain plenty of nutritional value, are thin enough to chew right through. Thilsted developed programs to expand awareness of dietary uses of small fish in the kitchen, helping families find more ways to get vital nutrients to their kids. One method is by drying the fish and pulverizing it into a sort of supplement that can then be added to rice or porridge to supercharge the nutrient values therein. “Dr. Thilsted’s work on nutrition, fish, and aquatic foods challenges us to think very critically about the scope of agricultural research and the urgent call to action to transform global food systems towards healthy and sustainable diets for all,” WorldFish Director Gareth Johnstone. Thilsted has worked for WorldFish for 10 years.

"The Australian government has moved to create two new marine protected areas that cover an expanse of ocean twice the size of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The two parks will be established around Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean to the northwest of continental Australia. The new parks cover 740,000 square kilometers (286,000 square miles) of ocean. The decision was immediately welcomed by conservation groups. “Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are uniquely Australian and globally significant – there’s nowhere like them on Earth,” said Michelle Grady, Director of The Pew Charitable Trusts, in a statement. “Most famous for its annual red crab migration, Christmas Island was referred to as one of the 10 natural wonders of the world by David Attenborough himself. Its thriving rainforests, deserted beaches and fringing reef provide a haven for unique and rare seabirds, land crabs and marine life.” “Christmas and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are recognized as globally significant standout natural wonders,” added Darren Kindleysides, CEO of the Australian Marine Conservation Society, in a statement. “Oceans across the globe are in deep trouble from pollution, overfishing, habitat loss and the very real and immediate impacts of climate change. Establishing marine parks to provide a safe haven for our marine life is critical in helping stop our oceans reaching a tipping point.” Christabel Mitchell, Director of the Save Our Marine Life Alliance, applauded the move but urged the Australian government to work “collaboratively” with local communities to “co-design” the protected areas. “Healthy oceans and sustainable fishing are central to the Christmas and Cocos Islanders’ way of life, their culture, and their livelihoods,” said Mitchell in a statement. “Creating world-class marine parks for this region will provide crucial protection for a wealth of marine life, make a significant global contribution to the health of our oceans and support the local communities’ culture and aspirations,” said Mitchell. “We look forward to working with the government and the island communities to preserve this unique part of Australia, for our marine life and future generations.” The new parks will bring the percentage of Australian waters under protection from 37% to 45%.

"Delaware State University officials are canceling up to $730,655 in student debt for recently graduated students who have faced financial hardship during the pandemic. Antonio Boyle, Vice President for Strategic Enrollment Management, estimated that the average eligible student will qualify for about $3,276 in debt relief—or roughly a third of a year’s tuition. This will help more than 220 graduates, removing any delay in receiving diplomas. “Too many graduates across the country will leave their schools burdened by debt, making it difficult for them to rent an apartment, cover moving costs, or otherwise prepare for their new careers or graduate school. While we know our efforts won’t help with all of their obligations, we all felt it was essential to do our part,” Mr. Boyle . The funds necessary to cancel these students’ debt became available through the federal government’s American Rescue Plan for COVID-19 relief. University President Tony Allen explained the significance of debt relief action, saying, “Our students don’t just come here for a quality college experience.  Most are trying to change the economic trajectory of their lives for themselves, their families, and their communities.  Our responsibility is to do everything we can to put them on the path.” Dr. Allen pointed out that such debt reduction is consistent with Delaware State University initiatives to keep student debt manageable. “We haven’t raised our tuition in over six years; we issue every incoming student an iPad or a MacBook; we are replacing traditional textbooks with less expensive digital editions, and our Early College High School saves the average family of nearly $50,000 in college expenses.” Last year, the annual US News &. World Report assessment of America’s top colleges lists Delaware State University among the top 1% in Social Mobility, which is defined as “enrolling and graduating large proportions of disadvantaged students.” Dr. Allen says he is also optimistic about Senate Bill 95, which would extend the University INSPIRE scholarship from half the tuition for four years to full tuition for eligible Delaware students. Earlier this month the legislation, sponsored by Senator Trey Paradee, passed the Senate unanimously, 21–0. “Great universities have to go a step beyond ordinary,” said Dr. Devona Williams, the Chair of the University’s Board of Trustees. “This is that kind of moment for us.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/delaware-state-university-cancels-outstanding-debt-covid-19-cases/
"Research on feral horses and wild donkeys in the American southwest show they dig desert wells with their hooves in the soft sand of riverbeds, thus creating a network of extra fresh water sources for the creatures that are native to the area. This find has thrown a wrench in the prevailing wisdom that feral equids, who were introduced by the Spanish, are pests that should be removed—as the scientist behind the research suggests they could be fulfilling a vital function once performed by now-extinct mammals from the Pleistocene. In modern conservation, if an animal turns up where it didn’t live a few hundred years ago and thrives there, it’s typically considered invasive. Invasive species are almost always seen as a menace, with animals like foxes, cats, goats, mice, sheep, pigs, cane toads, rats, carp, and others terrorizing delicate ecosystems in Madagascar, Galapagos, and Australia, to name a few examples. The Sonoran and Mojave Desert ecosystems wild horses and donkeys, which are considered invasive pests that outcompete other native herbivores, and suppress or trample native plants. Conservation doctrine would say they should be exterminated or removed, but sometimes it’s more complex than that, and Erick Lundgren from the University of Aarhus in Denmark has shown that the desert fauna’s eagerness to drink from these equine wells should be considered before making any decisions about the species’ future. Lundgren found that 59 different species frequented the water holes, and that species diversity around them was 64% higher than the ecosystem’s square-mile average. “Equid wells strongly reduced the isolation of water features, reducing average nearest-neighbor distances between water features by an average of 65%, and at most by 99%,” wrote Lundgren and his co-authors in the paper they . Monitoring four different sites in the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts, and sampling over 3,258 trap nights from 2015-2017, Lundgren found bobcats, javelina, mule deer, scrub jays, and 55 other vertebrates enjoying a drink. “There was a cacophony of organisms,” he told Digging for water is a common behavior among large mammals across the world, and in Africa, the elephant’s water wells are a gift to surrounding species. Certain animals, such as the elephant, beaver, and bison, are called “ecosystem engineers” because they shape their environment so dramatically, the flora and fauna therein depend and expect their impact, and have adapted to accommodate or exploit it. In his paper, Lundgren posits that American wild equids should be categorized as ecosystem engineers. “By changing the abiotic environment around them, certain organisms can really strongly facilitate other species and processes,” Lundgren said in a “The most notable aspect of deserts is the scarcity of water, and these animals can really enhance the availability of it through drought and in the hot summers where natural sources of water tend to dry up.” Questions like whether the wild equids’ presence has changed the landscape in positive ways, what really constitutes invasive and how far back is that measured, and whether our role is to constantly try to preserve what exists now, understanding that 99% of all species have gone extinct, and that Earth’s history has seen constant change, are common in mammal conservation. In , the author points out that since the Pleistocene, a large variety of worldwide megafauna has gone extinct in many different kinds of ecosystems. The services, or engineering those species performed on the landscape to the benefits of many animals and plants that still exist today are largely a mystery. Yet in number, introduced megafauna have restored about 15% of the estimated Pleistocene megafauna populations around the world. Nowhere is this perhaps more distinct than in North America, which not only had prehistoric pachyderms in the form of the mastodon, but also hyenas, sprinting cougars, the largest bear ever, and interestingly, several species of wild horse. “Recent and ancient extinctions and range contractions of megafauna, and the loss of their distinct ecological functions, has led to highly modified modern landscapes,” he writes. “Although introduced megafauna have primarily been studied as threats to conservation goals, growing evidence suggests that they present a countercurrent to ancient losses, and may replace lost ecological functions.” Could the desert animals observed in Lundgren’s study be reacting to a function which the ancestors of these modern donkeys and horses performed on the landscape tens of thousands of years ago? It’s a thought-provoking question, one which details has hit the community in different ways, with some choosing to remain with the current doctrine, and others reconsidering the pest-status of wild American equids.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wild-donkeys-and-horses-dig-wells-in-the-sonoran-desert/
"In a ‘world first’, a veterinarian performed surgery to heal an ulcerated cornea on the eye of a tiger. If one can withstand the insufferable puns, they might be pleased to note that 17-year-old Sumatran tiger Ratna at in England made a full recovery after the surgery that successfully restored her eyesight. Having had a cataract removed from her left eye in 2017, Ratna developed another problem in her conjunctiva, the pink part of the eyeball. Staff noticed her eyeball deteriorating, eventually turning bright red as if containing a fractured blood vessel. Surgeon Dr. David Williams, from the Queen’s Veterinary School Hospital at the University of Cambridge, performed an operation which is not uncommon in domestic cats and dogs, and was completed in much the same way—aside from needing “a lot more anesthesia.” It is believed to be the first “hood graft” surgery done on a big cat. Williams hypothesized that Ratna must have stuck her eye on a shard of bamboo in her enclosure. After two months of careful post-surgery monitoring, including daily eye drops, he declared Ratna as fully recovered. Ratna, who moved to Shepreth with her daughter in 2019, was known to enjoy sitting on the top platform of her enclosure—but once her cornea became worse, her coordination went, and getting up and down became a struggle. Describing her patience for human hands on her face as “fantastic,” Williams the vet told she is now “absolutely fine—you’d never know anything had been wrong.” The only bad news from the ordeal is that none of the staff, nor Dr. Williams, managed to report to the BBC that Ratna was “watching us all with the eye of the tiger.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/a-tiger-in-england-receives-corneal-eye-surgery-for-the-first-time-in-history/
"You can put your money where your mouth is, or you can put your money where your heart is, and for one bank headquartered in upstate New York, that philosophy is paying huge dividends for its community. Ulster Savings Bank (USB) has been a fixture in the Hudson Valley since 1851. To on April 12, the institution launched an initiative to celebrate with ‘170 Acts of Kindness’. “As a mutual savings bank, we were created for the benefit of our customers and the community, we have no shareholders. That enables us to keep all profits local and reinvest into the community in a number of ways,” the bank’s CEO and President Bill Calderara explained on the company website. “Celebrating our 170th anniversary with just as many random acts of kindness is our way of spreading kindness and supporting our community following a challenging year.” Since the effort began, the community outreach team at Ulster Savings has donated toys and puzzles to a local homeless shelter, as well as stuffed animals to an area child abuse prevention facility. They’ve also picked up the tab for everything from garbage collection, haircuts, pizza, groceries, restaurant meals, flowers, and coffee—to the fees for New York State auto inspections at local garages—all to ease the worries of local citizens who’ve been financially impacted by COVID-19. “Especially in times of crisis, being responsive to [the] community’s critical needs is paramount,” a statement from the bank’s website explained. Beginning in March 2020, USB “proactively dispersed $64,500 to immediately support local efforts in providing much-needed food and other essential services during the COVID-19 crisis.” But the community-centric bank had a well-earned reputation for its philanthropy long before the pandemic. Twenty years ago, in honor of the bank’s 150th anniversary, Ulster Savings created its in-house charitable foundation, the Ulster Savings Charitable Foundation, to “assist the community in the areas of education, housing, and health/human services.” “We were founded for our customers and for the benefit of the community at large. That’s part of our DNA,” Calderara said in an interview with WRNQ-92’s . “We take a good portion of our annual profits and give it back out to the community in donations.” Last year in response to the pandemic, USB gave out close to $600,000 in grants. While the money is certainly a much-needed boost, Calderara says everyone who works for USB is committed to sharing time as well. “Our goal is that 100% of employees volunteer every year,” he told Annie. (That works out to roughly 10,000 man-hours of community service annually.) Is it any wonder this bank with a huge heart enjoys a high rate of return in customer loyalty for its philanthropic ways?

"Australian scientists have been uncovering a near-unending list of ways kelp and other kinds of seaweed can help in the fight against climate change. It’s the continued study and harvesting of seaweed species in Australia that has Dr. Pia Winberg convinced they can play as large a role in human civilization as commodities like wheat, lumber, plastic, concrete, or nitrogen. In the same way that Australia has unique animals found nowhere else, their panoply of marine plant species is richer and more diverse than most places on Earth. “If we used the infrastructure in the oceans and created seaweed islands, we would actually eliminate a lot of the climate change issues we have today,” she says, in an from the BBC’s Isabelle Gerretsen. Her reasoning is based around seaweed’s rapid growth rate and ability to absorb carbon at much, much faster rates than terrestrial plants. Coupled with seaweed’s rich nutrient profile and unique molecular structure, Winberg believes it should be farmed on the largest scale, and that it could balance emissions, deacidify the oceans, change the way we farm, and open up a Pandora’s box of that could include everything from biodegradable plastics to construction materials to artificial body parts. 45,000 years ago, Aboriginal Australians were making water carriers out of kelp leaves. Its rubbery and flexible, yet thick and resilient texture made it perfect for the task. Nori, the seaweed eaten in Japanese cuisine, was the first-ever to be farmed when it was grown off the coast of Japan back in 1670. All kelp is seaweed, but not all seaweed is kelp. In fact, much like a LEGO set, the three species of seaweed are “red, yellow, and brown”. Kelp is a brown seaweed. In optimal conditions kelp can grow a staggering two feet while not requiring nitrogen-rich fertilizer like terrestrial crops, or, obviously, de-weeding. Just like on land, kelp and other seaweeds use photosynthesis to grow biomass by absorbing CO2, only they do at an estimated rate 50 times greater even than forests. During the devastating fires in the Amazon rainforest a few years ago, op-eds and other articles were awash with the phrase “Lungs of the Earth.” In reality it’s kelp that deserves such a title. According to a from the Marine Climate Change Program at Conservation International the current marine environment is where any modern, intelligent action against climate change should occur. 90% of the world’s carbon budget is held in the oceans, while between 30%-50% of all human-caused emissions have been absorbed by them. Winberg and her research associates feel seaweed has a big part to play in this figure. How big? Well that the total emissions from California’s agriculture sector could be absorbed if merely 3.8% of her coastal waters were turned over to kelp cultivation. Winberg isn’t an armchair algae activist; her family farm at Shoalhaven, New South Wales, puts into practice what could be considered a model for future agriculture and industry. Next door, a wheat refinery pumps its emissions into large vats of seawater where seaweed uses it through photosynthesis to grow. Nitrogen and other nutrients from the refinery fortify the green seaweed, allowing it to be turned into all kinds of different substrates for products like animal feed, cosmetics, and even ice cream. “Even just a 10% replacement of seaweed in wheat production or meat production in food would have a major impact,” explains Winberg, who believes that offshore seaweed cultivation in Australia is one of the best ways to target widescale seaweed farming. A 50-hectare mussel farm in Jarvis Bay is implementing this concept and growing seaweed alongside their mussel cultivation. The fishermen believe it improves the quality of the mussels, reasoning that the best shellfish always come from areas rich in marine plants. Their tradesman’s instincts aren’t wrong, as that the absorption of CO2 by kelp creates a buffer in their immediate vicinity, reducing the acidity levels of the ocean water around them, giving fish and shellfish better conditions to grow. When cultivated en masse, this deacidification could change the whole ocean ecosystem. In 2020 on the development of a dietary supplement that when given to cows eliminated 80% of the methane produced through their guts’ fermentation of feed, effectively eliminating the 2.8% of American emissions attributable to all livestock animals. That supplement was made from seaweed. Given that methane stays in the atmosphere for only 12 years, it wouldn’t take too long for an entire nation’s livestock industry would be methane neutral. Life began in the oceans, and rather than a magic space metal or nuclear fusion, the solution to many of the world’s biggest problems may require us to look back into our past, rather than into the future.

"An extremely rare calico lobster was recently found at a Red Lobster by employees who spotted its unique spotted shell. The male calico lobster, named Freckles by the staff in Manassas, arrived at the Virginia restaurant as part of a regular delivery from Maine. When team members recognized the lobster’s orange and black shell covering, they reached out to the Red Lobster support team to confirm its identity as a rare calico. After split-colored and albino lobsters, this is the third rarest kind of lobster on the planet, and the chances of catching a calico are 1 in 30 million. Calico lobsters seldom survive in the wild because their bright colors make them easily spotted by predators. The restaurant was connected to the aquarium at Virginia Living Museum. At the end of last month, a couple of staff members from the aquarium collected the lobster and safely transported him to his new home. The Virginia Living Museum and Red Lobster are both partners in the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program, which is committed to choosing sustainable seafood for healthier oceans, now and for future generations. After a veterinary evaluation and quarantining for 30 days to make sure he is still healthy, Freckles will soon join the museum’s public exhibit in the Chesapeake Bay Gallery. “We see [Freckles’ move] as an opportunity to share nature’s anomaly with guests,” explained Virginia Living Museum’s Senior Director of Animal Welfare and Conservation , “as well as continue important education about sustainable seafood practices and significant conservation efforts of the American lobster fishery.” This isn’t the first time Red Lobster staff have noticed an intriguing-looking crustacean.

"A group of campaigners and artists have joined together to throw a significant spanner in the works of a venture capital firm’s takeover of a historic London foundry. Plans to turn the site into a boutique hotel with office space for “creatives” and a café and restaurant has earned the ire of artists, former foundry craftsmen, community organizers, and heritage building conservationists. Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, bells were being forged in Whitechapel. Opened in 1570, the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in the East End of London, cast bells for 450 years, many of which still ring today—atop Big Ben, and another one with a famous crack in it sitting in a museum in Philadelphia. Behind Georgian brick walls amid factories and wharfs, workers at Whitechapel poured molten bronze into molds of London clay, and tuned the bells by shaving metal off of the inside before shipping them across the English-speaking world, of which 900 in Canada, 500 in Australia, and 600 in the U.S. still ring out every day. The details of the financial struggles of four generations of Whitechapel Foundry owners, the pain they endured as demand for bells evaporated after the World War II, the debts that piled up while a gentrified London encroached ever further into the East End, as well as everything one could ever wish to learn about bells, are captured brilliantly by O’Brien details how a Whitechapel foundry worker—a bell crafter named Nigel Taylor, took her around the neighborhood of Whitechapel while explaining that London used to be split into districts that were determined by the range of audible sound coming from the bells of a particular church. This is the source of the fable that every true Cockney Londoner was raised to the sound of “Bow bells,” referring to in Cheapside. Taylor is part of the coalition to save this piece of London heritage from conversion into a boutique hotel, organized by a special group of campaigners that not only want to see the building preserved in its current, dingy, and wonderful state, but the activities inside of it remain as well. , a UK charity that organized the public effort to block the hotel development plans in the foundry, specializes in supporting communities through the restoration and rejuvenation of heritage buildings at risk of decay or demolition. The details are long and involve many different characters, but here’s a summary: On December of 2018, Raycliff submitted their plans to the Tower Hamlet councilors. A year later in a deeply divided chamber, before protestors and knife-cutting tension, the vote for approval was split 3 to 3, with the Council Chairman holding the tiebreaker vote, which he cast in favor of Raycliff. However the story didn’t end there, as after campaigners sent a letter to Jenrick, asking him to suspend the ruling, he did just that, until “public inquiry could take place,” according to O’Brien. Today I called in the planning application for the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. This matter will now be subject to a public inquiry. This erupted into a war of words. Clarke was particularly annoyed that Raycliff and the foundry’s previous owner had sold without putting it up for public auction. This is due to British legal requirements for developing old buildings. If, the law states, development will substantially alter or damage a building with a designated historical value, the project cannot go through unless one of two stipulations is satisfied: either the development must create significant public benefits, or the site is too far gone to be useable, and no charity or grant funding is available. The final decision about whether the 450-year old Whitechapel Bell Foundry will continue to cast bells will be made by Secretary Jenrick, and if the he rules in Raycliff’s favor, Clarke told the Guardian that Re-Form and artistic partner Factum will be launching a new bell foundry in London to implement the same plan they had for Whitechapel. For this they’ve already trademarked “the London Bell Foundry,” and will soon be casting a bell at a foundry in Gloucestershire in collaboration with English contemporary artist Grayson Perry. For readers interested in following the decision, they’ll find it on the Right Honorable Robert Jenrick’s slated to be announced in the coming weeks.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/london-whitechapel-bell-foundry-redevelopment-scheme-fought-by-campaigners/

Staff from the Chicago Fire Department were taping the firefighters as they worked to fight the blaze when a black feline appeared through smoke billowing out of a broken window.

"The extraordinary flying ability of dandelion seeds is possible thanks to a form of flight that has not been seen before in nature, research has revealed. The discovery, which confirms the common plant among the natural world’s best fliers, shows that movement of air around and within its parachute-shaped bundle of bristles enables seeds to travel great distances—often a kilometer or more, kept afloat entirely by wind power. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh carried out experiments to better understand why dandelion seeds fly so well, despite their parachute structure being largely made up of empty space. Their study revealed that a ring-shaped air bubble forms as air moves through the bristles, enhancing the drag that slows each seed’s descent to the ground. This newly found form of air bubble—which the scientists have named the separated vortex ring—is physically detached from the bristles and is stabilized by air flowing through it. The amount of air flowing through, which is critical for keeping the bubble stable and directly above the seed in flight, is precisely controlled by the spacing of the bristles. This flight mechanism of the bristly parachute underpins the seeds’ steady flight. It is four times more efficient than what is possible with conventional parachute design, according to the research. Researchers suggest that the dandelion’s porous parachute might inspire the development of small-scale drones that require little or no power consumption. Such drones could be useful for remote sensing or air pollution monitoring. The study, published in , was led by Dr Cathal Cummins, who said: “Taking a closer look at the ingenious structures in nature—like the dandelion’s parachute—can reveal novel insights. “We found a natural solution for flight that minimizes the material and energy costs, which can be applied to engineering of sustainable technology.” That’s exciting news indeed.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/floating-dandelion-seeds-produce-vortex-not-noticed-before-by-scientists/
"A little girl has become famous in her neighbourhood after drawing colourful messages of hope on her family’s garage door in lockdown. Mom-of-two Christine Hilditch has been letting her five-year-old daughter Eilidh turn their black glossy garage door into a massive art project. Twice a week since April 2020, Eilidh has let her imagination run wild, covering the space with mermaids, dolphins, Spiderman, and dinosaurs. She has this week illustrated it with a rainbow, flowers, and the word ‘Hope’ as lockdown is further eased in Scotland. Eilidh has a little stool she can stand on to help her reach higher up, and her artist mom gives her a hand with things she struggles to reach. People stop them in the street to ask if the drawings are hers, and an adoring fan club has begun leaving boxes of chocolates on their doorstep. Proud mom Christine said: “Whatever comes into her head she does… It could be quite random, one week we had a fairytale as she had been learning about them at school so there was a fairy godmother and it began ‘Once upon a time’ and ended ‘Happily ever after’. “She did poppies for Remembrance Day, and one for Valentines’ Day. It depends on what is happening around her.” When neighborhood shops ran out of chalk, rather than paying more for it online, Christine decided to make some from scratch using plaster of Paris, food coloring, poster paint, and flour. Christine added: “She is just drawing outside to make people happy.” Christine has already worn out one broom by scrubbing down the garage but when it rains the chalk is washed away, and Eilidh starts from scratch on the next dry day. In August Eildih was rushed to hospital by ambulance after she flew off a roundabout in a playpark and broke her elbow, needing an operation to fix it. But while she couldn’t draw with her right arm she became ambidextrous. Christine said: “She was learning how to draw with her left hand, she just wanted to keep going. She was going into P1 [first grade] so she was really anxious about not being able to do stuff. Now she can write with her left hand as well as her right.” Eilidh is now loving being back at school as lockdown in Britain eases. And one thing is for sure—this little girl is no doubt excelling her art classes.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/eilidh-hilditch-garage-drawings-scotland-covid-19/
"Scientists have figured out how to modify the unrivaled gene-editing tool CRISPR to extend its reach to the epigenome, which controls how genes are switched on or off. The researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, and MIT’s non-profit Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and have already used the tool in the lab to mostly deactivate the gene that makes the protein Tau, which has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. The novel CRISPR-based tool called “CRISPRoff” allows scientists to switch off almost any gene in human cells without making a single edit to the genetic code—and once a gene is switched off, it remains inert in the cell’s descendants for hundreds of generations, unless it is switched back on with a complementary tool called CRISPRon. Because the epigenome plays a central role in many diseases, from viral infection to cancer, CRISPRoff technology may one day lead to powerful epigenetic therapies that are safer than conventional CRISPR therapeutics because it doesn’t involve any DNA edits. “Though genetic and cellular therapies are the future of medicine, there are potential safety concerns around permanently changing the genome, which is why we’re trying to come up with other ways to use CRISPR to treat disease,” said Luke Gilbert, PhD, a professor at UCSF and co-senior author of the new paper, published in the April 9 . Conventional CRISPR is equipped with two pieces of molecular hardware that make it an effective gene-editing tool. One component is a DNA-snipping enzyme, which gives CRISPR the ability to alter DNA sequences. The other is a homing device that can be programmed to zero in on any DNA sequence of interest, imparting precise control over where edits are made. : To build CRISPRoff, the researchers dispensed with conventional CRISPR’s DNA-snipping enzyme function, but retained the homing device, creating a stripped-down CRISPR capable of targeting any gene. Then they tethered an enzyme to this barebones CRISPR. But rather than splicing DNA, this enzyme acts on the epigenome, which consists of proteins and small molecules that latch onto DNA and control when and where genes are switched on or off. The new tool targets a particular epigenetic feature known as DNA methylation, which is one of many molecular parts of the epigenome. When DNA is methylated, a small chemical tag known as a methyl group is affixed to DNA, which silences nearby genes. Although DNA methylation occurs naturally in all mammalian cells, CRISPRoff offers scientists unprecedented control over this process. Another tool described in the paper, called CRISPRon, removes methylation marks deposited by CRISPRoff, making the process fully reversible. “Now we have a simple tool that can silence the vast majority of genes,” said Jonathan Weissman, PhD, Whitehead Institute member, co-senior author of the new paper and a former UCSF faculty member. “We can do this for multiple genes at the same time without any DNA damage, and in a way that can be reversed. It’s a great tool for controlling gene expression.” Based on previous work by a group in Italy, the researchers were confident that CRISPRoff would be able to silence specific genes, but they suspected that some 30 percent of human genes would be unresponsive to the new tool. : DNA consists of four genetic letters – A, C, G, T – but, in general, only Cs next to Gs can be methylated. To complicate matters, scientists have long believed that methylation could only silence genes at sites in the genome where CG sequences are highly concentrated, regions known as “CpG islands.” Since nearly a third of human genes lack CpG islands, the researchers assumed methylation wouldn’t switch these genes off. But their CRISPRoff experiments upended this epigenetic dogma. “What was thought before this work was that the 30 percent of genes that do not have CpG islands were not controlled by DNA methylation,” . “But our work clearly shows that you don’t require a CpG island to turn genes off by methylation. That, to me, was a major surprise.” Easy-to-use epigenetic editors like CRISPRoff have tremendous therapeutic potential, in large part because, like the genome, the epigenome can be inherited. : When CRISPRoff silences a gene, not only does the gene remain off in the treated cell, it also stays off in the descendants of the cell as it divides, for as many as 450 generations. To the researchers’ surprise, this held true even in maturing stem cells. Though the transition from stem cell to differentiated adult cell involves a significant rewiring of the epigenome, the methylation marks deposited by CRISPRoff were faithfully inherited in 90 percent of cells that made this transition, which showed that cells retain a memory of epigenetic modifications made by the CRISPRoff system even as they change cell type. They selected one gene to use as an example of how CRISPRoff might be applied to therapeutics: the gene that codes for Tau protein, which is implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. After testing the method in neurons, they discovered that using CRISPRoff could be used to turn Tau expression down—although not entirely off. “What we showed is that this is a viable strategy for silencing Tau and preventing that protein from being expressed,” . “The question is, then, how do you deliver this to an adult? And would it really be enough to impact Alzheimer’s? Those are big open questions, especially the latter.” Even if CRISPRoff does not lead to Alzheimer’s therapies, there are many other conditions it could potentially be applied to. Their findings suggest that CRISPRoff would only need to be administered once to have lasting therapeutic effects, making it a promising approach for treating rare genetic disorders – including Marfan syndrome, which affects connective tissue, Job’s syndrome, an immune system disorder, and certain forms of cancer – that are caused by the activity of a single damaged copy of a gene. : While delivery to specific tissues remains a challenge, “we showed that you can deliver it transiently as a DNA or as an RNA, the same technology that’s the basis of the Moderna and BioNTech coronavirus vaccine,” Weissman says. Because the epigenome plays a central role in so many diseases, this exciting new technology may one day lead to powerful therapies to tackle our deadliest foes, although “further work is needed to realize its full therapeutic potential.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/crisper-on-off-switch-discovered/
"Nearly seven in 10 Americans identify their mom as “the cool mom,” according to a new poll. The survey of 2,000 American adults identified the attributes they think set their mother apart from the parenting pack. So what makes a mom a “cool” mom? Among the 68% of respondents who agreed that their mom was a “cool mom,” 62% said it was because she talked with her kids openly about anything and everything. Relaxing the rules a bit may be another key, as over half said their mom’s coolness stemmed from the fact that she let them get away with things a “normal” mom wouldn’t when they were growing up. (See all the top reasons at the bottom.) Being an epic gift-giver, or having great style, seemed to be a component as well, with 52% saying that her tendency to spoil both her loved ones and herself was what made their mom a cut above the rest. : Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of Angara.com in celebration of Mother’s Day, the survey also probed the most important lessons Americans have learned from their moms over the years. The answers from respondents ranged from how to “be responsible” and “live in the moment” to “how to be a super parent.” “Don’t judge others, even if you think you have the whole story,” said one respondent. “It’s not a crime to pamper yourself when life gets too stressful,” added another. One learned to “respect yourself and others will respect you.” : Nearly seven in 10 respondents (68%) report that they learned how to juggle responsibilities from watching their moms “do it all” over the years. In fact, over 60% saying that their mom has been juggling more in the past year than she ever has before. So it’s perhaps unsurprising that three-quarters of respondents think that, after a long and taxing year, their mom deserves to be fully spoiled this holiday. “Every mother’s relationship with their child or children is different,” said Ankur Daga, Founder and CEO of . “It’s worth keeping your unique relationship with your mom in mind when planning how to make her feel special this Mother’s Day.” : “But spending a lot (of money) is less important than finding a gift that’s truly ‘her’.” 1.

"Self-conscious Brits finally stop worrying about what other people think of them at the age of 46, according to a new poll. A survey of 2,000 adults aged 55 and over found they feel comfortable in their own skin when they turn 42, and become content in their careers aged 40. As a result of feeling comfortable in their own skin and ‘unapologetically themselves’, 72 percent of adults feel more ‘content’ in life. Victoria Betts, from shoe brand , which commissioned the OnePoll survey, said: “Feeling comfort is crucial to being happy in life. But there are so many different areas in life to feel comfortable in, and it’s no wonder it takes Brits until their 40s to tick them all off. “Our results found nearly seven in 10 adults think it’s important that people should be allowed to be unapologetically themselves. But for many, the desire to fit in, not make waves and go with the flow means they don’t have the confidence to do this until later in life.” One in three adults believe becoming a parent was key to them feeling more comfortable in themselves, and a quarter put it down to learning to drive. Being more comfortable in their own skin made things like speaking in front of a crowd easier for 28 percent of respondents. And 39 percent no longer dread meeting new people and fumbling for ways to make themselves sound interesting. However, one in three believe they didn’t feel comfortable in their own skin until later in life than they imagined when they were younger. Some of the people surveyed said they’d love to encourage their past selves to embrace all of life’s challenges, and learn to take lessons from the hard parts as well as the good. 1.

"When most people think about adding a new creature to the family menagerie, images of “fuzzy” and “cute” spring to mind. Gargoyles and demons? Maybe not so much. But gargoyles and demons need love, too. “Love is like a tree,” wrote Victor Hugo his classic . “It shoots of itself; it strikes its roots deeply into our whole being, and frequently continues to put forth green leaves over a heart in ruins.” After the Cathedral of Notre Dame was partially destroyed by a raging fire in 2019, many of its famous statues and paintings were damaged. Now, thanks to a new crowdfunding effort from , the color of love is also the color of money. People from around the world are being invited to “adopt” their favorite resident monster—or saint—and donate to its restoration. France’s cathedrals (including Notre-Dame) are all owned by the nation of France, since 1905, rather than the Catholic church. A click-through gallery catalogs Notre Dame’s extensive art inventory and notes the progress of each individual piece’s fundraising goals. According to site statistics, male saints have taken a substantial early lead. Sadly, in the upper galleries, the cathedral’s iconic gargoyles and the fabulous 19th-century grotesques that “recreate the fantastic universe of the Middle Ages” have fallen behind in the . (Joan of Arc could use some help, as well.) What would Quasimodo do? Since according to Hugo, “The saints were his friends and blessed him; the monsters were his friends and kept watch over him,” our guess is Notre Dame’s most storied resident would be tolling the bells loud and clear in aid of his cherished friends. So why not go just ahead and adopt a gargoyle today? C’mon, you know you want to. And the best part is… they’re housebroken.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/adopt-notre-dame-gargoyle/
"The United Kingdom loves its butterflies: Its Butterfly Conservation is the world’s largest insect-focused conservation organization, and it’s just helped yet another species recover from dangerously low numbers. Ten years ago the Duke of Burgundy butterfly, named after an aristocrat from a faraway land, was found only in the southern Lake District and the North York Moors. At that point it was Britain’s rarest butterfly. In the two decades prior, its numbers had fallen 46%. Now its population, of which the newly emerged adults will be preparing to take flight on May winds, has grown 25% between 2010 and 2020. The by the Butterfly Conservation was launched in 2011 in response to the dismal population surveys, and included 23 hectares of habitat restoration, management advice for 147 different sites where the Dukes were present, and rallying 1,000 volunteers ranging from land owners to concerned local citizens. The Duke’s recovery was well-summarized when last spring a butterfly enthusiast and writer stumbled upon the largest single colony in the country. The colony was found, according to the , on the hills of a Dorset organic dairy farm, whose owner has proudly supported habitat for butterflies, including the Duke, in his fields for 20 years. The has championed the cause of hundreds of different species in decline. They convinced the UK government to use moths and butterflies as official biodiversity indicators, and manage 190 nature reserves in the country while conducting 1,600 events yearly to promote awareness of such insects and what they need to thrive in and around human civilization. Dark brown with orange-peel spots on the outer halves of its wings, it’s no surprise the Duke of Burgundy butterfly could remain hidden in such large numbers. The males are solitary but for the mating season when they compete with other males for territory, while the females and caterpillars deliberately hide themselves under leaves in scrubland and sunny forest clearings.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/englands-duke-of-burgundy-butterfly-numbers-grow-25-percent/

He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com TAURUS (April 20-May 20): In her poem “Mirror,” Taurus poet wrote, “I am dazed by the beauty of my body.” I applaud her brazen admiration and love for her most valuable possession. I wish more of us could genuinely feel that same adoration for our own bodies. And in accordance with current astrological omens, I recommend that you do indeed find a way to do just that right now. It’s time to upgrade your excitement about being in such a magnificent vessel. Even if it’s not in perfect health, it performs amazing marvels every minute of every day. I hope you will boost your appreciation for its miraculous capacities, and increase your commitment to treating it as the treasure that it is. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Gemini poet writes that after the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami of 2004, “the only structure still standing in the wiped-out village of Malacca [in Malaysia] was a statue of Mahatma Gandhi. I wanna be able to stand like that.” I expect you will indeed enjoy that kind of stability and stamina in the coming weeks, my dear. You won’t have to endure a metaphorical tsunami, thank Goddess, but you may have to stand strong through a blustery brouhaha or swirling turbulence. Here’s a tip: The best approach is not to be stiff and unmoving like a statue, but rather flexible and willing to sway. CANCER (June 21-July 22): No educator had ever offered a class in psychology until trailblazing philosopher did so in 1875. He knew a lot about human behavior. “Most people live in a very restricted circle of their potential being,” he wrote. “They make use of a very small portion of their possible consciousness, and of their soul’s resources in general, much like a person who, out of his whole bodily organism, should get into a habit of using only his little finger.” I’m going to make an extravagant prediction here: I expect that in the coming months you will be better primed than ever before to expand your access to your consciousness, your resources, and your potentials. How might you begin such an adventure? The first thing to do is to set a vivid intention to do just that. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): “Someone in me is suffering and struggling toward freedom,” wrote Greek author . To that melodramatic announcement, I reply, good for him! I’m glad he was willing to put himself through misery and despair in order to escape misery and despair. But I also think it’s important to note that there are other viable approaches to the quest for liberation. For example, having lavish fun and enjoying oneself profoundly can be tremendously effective in that holy work. I suspect that in the coming weeks, Leo, the latter approach will accomplish far more for you than the former. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Virgo novelist sold hundreds of millions of books, and is history’s most-translated author. While growing up, she had few other kids to associate with, so she created a host of imaginary friends to fill the void. They eventually became key players in her work as an author, helping her dream up stories. More than that: She simply loved having those invisible characters around to keep her company. Even in her old age, she still consorted with them. I bring this to your attention, Virgo, because now is a great time to acquire new imaginary friends or resurrect old ones. Guardian angels and ancestral spirits would be good to call on, as well. How might they be of assistance and inspiration to you? LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): “To hurry pain is to leave a classroom still in session,” notes Libran aphorist . On the other hand, he observes, “To prolong pain is to miss the next lesson.” If he’s correct, the goal is to dwell with your pain for just the right amount of time—until you’ve learned its lessons and figured out how not to experience it again in the future—but no longer than that. I suspect that such a turning point will soon be arriving for you. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): In her poem “Every Day,” Scorpio poet wrote, “Every day, every day I hear enough to fill a year of nights with wondering.” I think that captures the expansive truth of your life in the coming weeks. You’ve entered a phase when the sheer abundance of interesting input may at times be overwhelming, though enriching. You’ll hear—and hopefully be receptive to—lots of provocative stories, dynamic revelations, and unexpected truths. Be grateful for this bounty! Use it to transform whatever might be stuck, whatever needs a catalytic nudge. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): I hope you’re not too stressed these days. There has been pressure on you to adjust more than maybe you’d like to adjust, and I hope you’ve managed to find some relaxing slack amidst the heaviness. But even if the inconvenience levels are deeper than you like, I have good news: It’s all in a good cause. Read the wise words of author , who describes the process you’re midway through: “Every positive change, every jump to a higher level of energy and awareness, involves a rite of passage. Each time we ascend to a higher rung on the ladder of personal evolution, we must go through a period of discomfort, of initiation. I have never found an exception.” CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): We can safely say that writer Anais Nin was a connoisseur of eros and sensuality. “Sex must be mixed with tears, laughter, words, promises, jealousy, envy, all the spices of fear, foreign travel, new faces, stories, dreams, fantasies, music.” In response to Nin’s litany, I’m inclined to say, “Damn, that’s a lot of ambiance and scaffolding to have in place. Must it always be so complicated?” According to my reading of upcoming cosmic rhythms, you won’t need such a big array of stuff in your quest for soulful orgasms—at least not in the coming weeks. Your instinct for rapture will be finely tuned. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): “One is always at home in one’s past,” wrote author . I agree. Sometimes that’s not a good thing, though. It may lead us to flee from the challenges of the present moment and go hide and cower and wallow in nostalgia. But on other occasions, the fact that we are always at home in the past might generate brilliant healing strategies. It might rouse in us a wise determination to refresh our spirit by basking in the deep solace of feeling utterly at home. I think the latter case is likely to be true for you in the coming weeks, Aquarius. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): “Not everything is supposed to become something beautiful and long-lasting,” writes author Emery Allen. “Not everyone is going to stay forever.” Her message is a good one for you to keep in mind right now. You’re in a phase when transitory boosts and temporary help may be exactly what you need most. I suspect your main task in the coming weeks is to get maximum benefit from influences that are just passing through your life. The catalysts that work best could be those that work only once and then disappear. ARIES (March 21-April 19): Poet despairingly noted that many people want MORE MORE MORE LIFE, but they go awry because they allow their desire for MORE MORE MORE LIFE to fixate on material things—machines, possessions, gizmos, and status symbols. Ginsberg revered different kinds of longings: for good feelings, meaningful experiences, soulful breakthroughs, deep awareness, and all kinds of love. In accordance with astrological potentials, Aries, I’m giving you the go-ahead in the coming weeks to be extra greedy for the stuff in the second category.

"Australia last week committed $100 million to ocean conservation in an effort to protect ‘blue carbon’ environments and reduce emissions. Uniquely suited to care about marine life, as the world’s only island continent, the investment package will also support Australian Marine Parks, expand the Indigenous Protected Areas in the Sea Country and protection of marine species. Much of the funding will go towards ecosystems that involve seagrass and mangroves, which play a key role in drawing carbon out of the atmosphere. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia’s oceans would be key to the country’s role in driving down emissions. “The climate and the planet’s oceans are inextricably linked. This investment is a major contribution to domestic and international efforts to build healthier oceans and combat climate change,” said Morrison. “This investment will boost the seagrass and mangroves that will help cut emissions and it’ll mean cleaner beaches, lower fisheries bycatch, more fish stocks, better protection for turtles and seabirds, and help for coastal and Indigenous communities reliant on the ocean for their livelihoods.” : Around 85 percent of the Aussie population lives within 50 kilometers of the coast. Minister for the Environment, Sussan Ley said $39.9 million will go towards reinforcing Australia’s position as a world leader in marine park management which includes: : $30.6 million will be invested in practical action to restore and account for blue carbon ecosystems. This will improve the health of coastal environments in Australia and around the region and export Australia’s internationally recognized expertise in ocean accounting, while boosting regional employment and enabling us to account for the value of these habitats as blue carbon repositories: : $18 million will target practical actions to protect iconic marine species, improve the sustainability of our fisheries through reducing bycatch and stimulate investment in our oceans: The Government has also newly pledged $59.9 million to develop a high-integrity carbon offset scheme in its Indo-Pacific region to stimulate investment in high-quality projects that deliver carbon offsets that meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement. “The Emissions Reduction Fund is one of the largest and most robust offset schemes in the world. We see an opportunity to work with our Indo-Pacific partners, and pass on the know-how and success of that program to reduce emissions and create jobs,” Angus Taylor said. The investments are in addition to more than $1.1 billion the Morrison Government has this week announced it will invest in low emissions energy technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage—and is in addition to the $18 billion of investment the Government is making alongside the Technology Investment Roadmap over the next 10 years to drive at least $70 billion of total new investment in low emissions technologies in Australia by 2030.

"We heard that the annual National Day of Prayer has also spurred atheists to action—and they’re using the occasion to do good works in their community. The Atheist Community of Polk County, Florida, for instance,11 is organizing a number of community service events and an awareness campaign to suggest that “fellowship” doesn’t require “faith”. It’s all part of an annual effort to celebrate a national instead of observing the National Day of Prayer, which was set aside in U.S. federal law for people of faith to pray for the nation on the first Thursday in May. In place of observing a day of thoughts and prayers, secular groups nationwide organize service projects. This year’s emphasis is on a compassionate response to hunger and homelessness, which were exacerbated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The nonprofit which covers the metro areas of Lakeland and Winter Haven, runs several ongoing programs to address social issues. They even partnered with a church in a unique food pantry coalition as a direct response to the COVID-19.

"A giant agricultural company’s years of work on a renewable, sustainable diesel fuel is finally coming to fruition—and it’s made from 100% waste products. A 50-50 joint venture between Cargill and Love’s Travel Stops, will produce and market a green fuel under the name Heartwell Renewables. Its new production plant now under construction in Hastings, Nebraska, will have the ability to produce approximately 80 million gallons of renewable diesel fuel annually—while creating 50 new jobs there. Cargill will provide feedstock in the form of tallow, the animal fat discarded during its beef processing, and also used cooking oil. Once the diesel is produced, the Love’s Family of Companies, which owns and operates truck stops in 41 states, will transport and market the product in the U.S. : Heartwell Renewables will be the only entity of its kind to both produce and market renewable diesel all the way to the retail pump. “When considering the environmental benefits and performance enhancements of renewable diesel, the creation of Heartwell Renewables is a long-term win for not only the companies involved, but also for consumers and the environment,” said JP Fjeld-Hansen, a vice president at Love’s Family of Companies. The production process makes renewable diesel chemically identical to petroleum diesel with significant improvements in environmental performance due to its drop in carbon intensity and emissions. Renewable diesel also has a faster combustion speed, which brings more power to an engine and has been shown to lead to lower vehicle maintenance, according to a . : “Through the partnership with Love’s, both companies can leverage their unique expertise and resources to address the growing demand for biofuels, while making an impact in the communities where we operate,” said Cargill’s John Niemann. Operations should start in the spring of 2023. Once the plant opens, it will be one of only a handful of renewable diesel plants in the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Department.

"Weeds compete for soil nutrients, water, space, and sunlight with the crops farmers grow to help feed people. Now a third-generation weeding robot, armed with lasers and powered by AI, offers the ultimate labor-saving device—while also eliminating the need for chemical herbicides. The Autonomous Weeder by can eliminate 100,000 weeds per hour, and in a single day—numbers that require a person working an entire season to match. Trundling down a row of crops, a battery of twelve cameras scan the ground, identifying weeds through machine-learning and killing them with a CO2 laser. CO2 lasers use reactions between nitrogen, helium, carbon, and oxygen to generate powerful beams of light that are concentrated through mirrors inside the laser. The robot’s onboard supercomputer ensures millimeter precision with its laser so as to avoid accidently clipping crops. “This is one of the most innovative and valuable technologies that I’ve seen as a farmer,” said James Johnson of Carzalia Farm in a , who has utilized Carbon Robotics’ technology on his farm. “I expect the robots to go mainstream because of how effectively they address some of farming’s most critical issues, including the overuse of chemicals, process efficiency, and labor. The sky’s the limit.” If a farmer wants to avoid using chemical herbicides, which have flooded nearly every corner of our food and water supply chains with in the form of glyphosate, they must find enough unskilled workers to pull weeds manually—a difficult task in the already shorted market of agricultural labor. Solving both problems, it’s no surprise that the 2021 model of the Autonomous Weeder has already sold out, even considering its price tag which was quoted at “hundreds of thousands of dollars.” Attempting to make the device more accessible, lease options are available from the company, as they have already made the 2022 models available for preorder. The de-weeding method of the robot is Certified Organic and in line with regenerative farming practices. Cost-effective weed control is the biggest barrier to entry with organic farming, and agriculturalists looking to make the switch finally have a seriously scalable alternative to help them get their veg out to people.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/carbon-robotics-autonomous-weeder-destroys-weeds-with-lasers/
"This week, we’ll be treated to one of spring’s best stargazing events as the Eta Aquarid meteor shower lights up the skies. You’ll want to set your alarm for before dawn on Wednesday, May 5, as that’s when the greatest number of meteors—originating in the debris trail of ice and rock particles from Halley’s comet—will alight the night. The mornings of May 4 and 6 are also set to have a decent number of meteors. The Aquarids are famously fast—rushing into Earth’s atmosphere of speeds around 148,000 miles per hour (66 kilometers per second), according to . Such meteors can leave glowing trains of light—or incandescent bits of debris—which can be seen for seconds or even minutes. Readers in the Northern Hemisphere can expect around 10 meteors per hour at its peak. In the north, the meteors are more likely to be seen as ‘earthgrazers’: shooting stars with long, bright trails that appear to ‘graze’ the earth as they streak across the sky from just below the horizon. The moon is pretty full this week, so the sky may be quite bright where you are—impeding optimal meteor viewing. Still, with a little patience, you should get a great show in the coming nights. Just look east towards the Aquarius constellation—specifically at the bright Eta Aquarii star—and maybe get that wide-angle lens ready so you can capture the event?",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/meteor-shower-may-2021-eta-aquarid/
"Unilever has partnered with LanzaTech and India Glycols to produce a laundry soap made from industrial carbon emissions—instead of from fossil-fuels. The innovative shift in production utilizes biotechnologies and a newly configured supply chain between the three partners, who are working together for the first time. Typically derived from fossil fuels, surfactants are a critical ingredient for creating the foam and cleaning action of many household cleaning and laundry products—from dish soaps to fabric detergents. The new process now allows surfactants to be made using recycled carbon. Recycled carbon is a key form of renewable carbon and is essential to eliminating the use of fossil fuels. : The process marks the first time a surfactant made using captured carbon emissions will be offered to consumers in a mainstream cleaning product. The new surfactant launched in China on April 22nd, Earth Dan, in an OMO (Persil) laundry capsule—and, best of all, will not increase the price of the product. Unilever consumer data from 2020 found that 87% of consumers in China considered climate change as serious a threat as Covid-19, the highest of all countries polled. The breakthrough process involves primarily three stages: – LanzaTech, a “world leader in CarbonSmart products”, uses biotechnology to capture industrial waste emissions at its Beijing Shougang plant and converts these emissions to ethanol, which is estimated to cut the greenhouse gas emissions by 82% compared to the traditional fossil-fuel process, according to a company study. : India Glycols converts the ethanol into ethylene oxide, a key feedstock to make surfactants at their site in India. : Unilever uses the surfactant in the new OMO laundry capsules, manufactured at its Hefei factory in China. The partnership is just one way that Unilever is making good on its September 2020 Clean Future pledge, which states that the multinational company hopes to eliminate fossil-fuel based chemicals from its cleaning and laundry product formulations by 2030. : “Advancements in technology like this mean we can now reinvent the chemistry of our products, asserts Peter ter Kulve, President of Home Care, Unilever. “Instead of valuable carbon being released directly into the atmosphere, we can capture it and recycle it in our products instead of using fossil fuels. “New innovations like this help move our iconic cleaning brands away from fossil fuels without compromising on performance or affordability,” he added in . Jennifer Holmgren, the CEO of LanzaTech said, “Our planet is running out of time and how we treat carbon requires urgent revision. By working with Unilever and IGL we can turn waste carbon into an opportunity, keeping fossil fuels in the ground and enabling new circular processes to make the products we use every day.” : A recent report estimates that renewable carbon production will need to increase by a factor of 15x by 2050 to phase-out the use of fossil carbon in consumer products. The Unilever Home Care division also has committed to achieving Net Zero emissions from all products by 2039.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/unilever-launches-laundry-soap-made-of-industrial-carbon-emissions/
"A professional yacht racer in France, annoyed by the constant sightings of floating mats of plastic garbage in coastal waters, has designed an ocean-cleaning sailboat that is powered by the waste it collects. The 56-meter (184 feet) Manta is the first offering from racer Yves Bourgnon’s , and would be one of the largest waste-collecting vessels on the seas, according to . At the end of the film Dr. Emmet Brown has famously managed to replace his plutonium-powered generator with one which uses ordinary garbage. Like the DeLorean in the movie, the Manta uses garbage to power an electric motor that works in conjunction with the sails to propel the large catamaran. In between the three pontoons, conveyor belts scoop up trash as small as 10 millimeters, over which the Manta glides, while three trawl nets drifting behind (to a depth of 1 meter, thereby avoiding sea life) add to the onboard collection. This trash is then fed into a processing machine where crewmen sort it before moving it into an incinerator that shreds and melts the plastic—and even uses the heat and gases—to power a turbine to creates the electric power. Paired with solar panels lining the decks and a wind turbine that harvests power from the wind coming off the sails, the Manta would be 70% self-sufficient in terms of energy, allowing it to sail around sucking up 3 tons of waste an hour, without almost ever needing to return to harbor and refuel or offload plastic. There’s also room onboard for a scientific laboratory, allowing marine biologists and chemists to study the effects of plastic on the ecosystem. Unveiled purely as a concept, the SeaCleaners want to put a working prototype on the waves by 2024. Bourgnon believes that if 400 of the vessels were made, they could eventually remove 33% of the ocean’s plastic pollution.

"A devoted 79-year-old husband visited a beauty school to get lessons in hair and make-up to help his “beautiful” wife who can no longer get ready by herself. The gentleman walked into Alberta’s Delmar College of Hair and Esthetics and told director Carrie Hannah that he wanted to learn how to use the curling wand. His wife’s vision was failing and she keeps burning herself as a result, so he was looking for a few tips. The man was paired with a student and mannequin and was taught how to operate the curling wand and protect his wife’s skin. He also asked for tips on applying her mascara. The adorable OAP also asked for tips on applying her mascara. Carrie said: “My staff and students were so touched by his sincere wish to help his wife of 50 plus years. “He lovingly pulled pictures from his wallet, showing everyone his wife, and boasted about how beautiful and talented she has always been. “Her appearance has always been something she has taken pride in and it’s important to her so therefore important to him.” “He is turning 80 in May, and I think he is also a very brave man for stepping into a hair college and asking for lessons on styling hair, as I don’t think too many men would do that. “In an age of staged social media photos, it was really great to see an authentic real human gesture of love.” Since his initial visit, both the man and his wife have visited the college to express their gratitude to everyone there.

"Some pet owners get a kick from dressing their mellow-tempered puppers in ‘Chuckie’ garb for Halloween, but in everyday life, when dogs aren’t treated with care and socialized properly, the behavior that ensues can be, let’s just say, a little ornery—no costume required. And that was exactly the case for Prancer, whose cheerful name belied a four-legged “demon” dog his frazzled foster mom feared was never going to find his furever home. “Ok, I’ve tried. I’ve tried for the last several months to post this dog for adoption and make him sound…palatable. The problem is, he’s just not,” Tyfanee Fortuna’s now-viral . In addition to her belief that rather than a dog, Prancer was “a vessel for a traumatized Victorian child that now haunts our home,” Fortuna ruefully admitted, “There’s not a very big market for neurotic, man-hating, animal-hating, children-hating dogs that look like gremlins. “But I have to believe there’s someone out there for Prancer, because I am tired and so is my family. Every day we live in the grips of the demonic Chihuahua hellscape he has created.” Placing the ill-tempered pup was beginning to seem a near-impossible task, but love and social media work in mysterious ways. When Ariel Davis read the hilariously blunt profile description Fortuna had posted for the itsy-bitsy Beelzepup, it seemed as if her life had come full circle. Several years earlier, Davis had been forced by circumstance to surrender Doodle, a Chi/Jack Russel terrier mix she’d raised from a puppy that was eerily similar in personality to Prancer. “He had a lot of the same qualities as Prancer,” she told . “He was a little neurotic and he barked a lot and he didn’t work well with other people and other animals. I spent a lot of time working with him and understanding his personality and learning about myself through him.” With her life back on track after rehab, Davis felt she was ready to take on the commitment of dog ownership again, and she was pretty certain Prancer was her doggy soulmate. “Reading about Prancer brought back intense memories of the dog I still love so much,” Davis wrote on her email application to Prancer’s sponsor, . “They were very similar in demeanor… I am not looking to replace Doodle, but I am looking for a companion that I can take proper care of and give a loving home.” Davis, who is single, has a female housemate, works at a women’s rehab center, and has no other pets seemed like Prancer’s perfect match. Their first meeting confirmed it. “I got there and we just connected,” Davis told TODAY. “Prancer took pretty well to me. Eventually, I took [him] for a walk and he wasn’t nipping at me or biting at my heels. We just got along. With my story and the fact that I didn’t come off as incredibly crazy just kind of meshed and everything seemed to go well. He went home with me that day. He was a perfect little gentleman in the car.” Perfect gentleman or demon may be in the eye of the beholder, but one thing’s for sure: Prancer’s a lucky dog that’s going to be loved for the rest of his life. And Fortuna, whose snarky adoption strategy won the Internet couldn’t be more pleased. “Time flies when you’re having fun. Time also flies when the Chihuahua who held your family hostage for 6 months finally gets adopted. Prancer is almost a distant nightmare to me now, even though he was adopted just over a week ago. His adoption day was one of the best days of my life,” . “On the flip side, I couldn’t help but feel a bit wrong….it was like expelling myself of a demon and passing it on to someone else. I justify it by knowing it was a consensual exchange, and I couldn’t have made the terms and conditions anymore clear. It also helps that his new victim is madly in love with him (or she has Stockholm syndrome already.)” P.S.

"Researchers in Finland have discovered that electrodes in lithium batteries containing cobalt can be reused following a special process. In comparison to traditional recycling, which typically extracts metals from crushed batteries by melting or dissolving them, the new process—which newly saturates the electrodes with lithium—saves valuable raw materials, and likely also energy. The proliferation of electric cars, smartphones, and portable devices is leading to an estimated 25 percent increase globally in the manufacturing of rechargeable batteries each year. Many raw materials used in the batteries, such as cobalt, may soon be in short supply. The European Commission is preparing a new battery decree, which would require the recycling of 95 percent of the cobalt in batteries. Yet existing battery recycling methods are far from perfect. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have two electrodes between which electrically charged particles move. Lithium cobalt oxide is used in one electrode and, in most of the batteries, the other is made of carbon and copper. In traditional battery recycling methods, some of batteries’ raw materials are lost and lithium cobalt oxide turns into other cobalt compounds, which require a lengthy chemical refinement process to turn them back into electrode material. The new method from scientists at Aalto University sidesteps this painstaking process: by replenishing the spent lithium in the electrode through an electrolysis process—commonly used in industry—the cobalt compound can be directly reused. The results, , show that the performance of electrodes newly saturated with lithium is almost as good as that of those made of new material. Aalto University Professor Tanja Kallio believes that with further development the method would also work on an industrial scale. ‘By reusing the structures of batteries we can avoid a lot of the labour that is common in recycling and potentially save energy at the same time. We believe that the method could help companies that are developing industrial recycling,’ Kallio says. The researchers next aim to see if the same method could also be used with the nickel-based batteries of electric cars.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/battery-parts-recycled-without-crushing-melting-aalto/
"Produced by the U.S. Navy for use in World War II, and now consigned primarily for storage use on farms, the Quonset hut is experiencing a rebirth within the residential neighborhoods of Detroit. The long half-cylinder of corrugated steel, prefabricated in factories, was used by development company Prince Concepts to create a unique apartment building of eight high-ceilinged units for 30% less than comparable affordable housing in up-and-coming neighborhoods in the city. “A Quonset hut isn’t a design, it’s a tool—think about it the same way you’d think about a brick, it’s a tool to achieve a purpose,” explains their website. “For , Prince Concepts challenged architect, Ishtiaq Rafiuddin, to create an 8 unit project within one massive hut, as a 9,000 square foot sculpture with 6 residences and 2 Live/Work spaces that anchors a public park where people can soak up the majesty of a new age monument.” The Caterpillar’s designer and financier, Philip Kafka, has been using Quonset hut architecture to cut costs and offer unique housing and business opportunities in Detroit. Between the low cost of the hut, and of the land in the city, his projects offer perspective renters something totally unique in terms of price and style. “With [another rental project that consists of live/work spaces, which gave rise to an art gallery and a yoga studio] we used the Quonset hut to create a sculptural community with public and semi-private outdoor nooks that residents and neighbors, alike, could enjoy, marvel at and marvel in,” Kafka explains. In an interview with the Texas-born, former-NYC advertisement mogul describes his work as “Home-Depot architecture.” The Caterpillar rooms are between 750-1375 square feet, with walls pock-marked with symmetrical window arrangements, hardwood floors, and a 23-foot high vaulted ceiling. “You get a sunrise view in your bedroom and a sunset view in your living room. That was intentional. It’s all about light, this project,” Kafka explained. “The real benefit isn’t that the Quonset hut lets me build a project so inexpensively, it’s that it lets me give people extremely high-quality space for a reasonable price.” In addition, the landscape is bespoke, and features a wrap around deck, gardens, and forty trees. The project was fully leased months before it was officially finished. With raw wood, steel, pipes, and other construction materials fully visible inside, the Caterpillar, and True North for that matter, were designed with artists in mind, whose creativity would be able to be unleashed upon the raw space. Kafka says he doesn’t want to become the Quonset hut guy, only that it allows him to build bold spaces and buildings on the cheap side.

"Is it really any surprise that the world’s largest scuba diver training organization is instructing a new generation of freedivers in the art and techniques of “mermaiding?” PADI, the aforementioned organization, now offers , which is essentially freediving but with a large and sometimes heavy artificial tail that requires a different kind of human locomotion. Humans have always been drawn to forms of extreme movement, and since ancient times, bungee jumping with jungle vines, surfing with primitive boards, or skiing with pieces of wood covered in leather and fur have allowed people alternative ways to move around and get their thrills. That hasn’t stopped, and modern technologies like parachutes, or in this case artificial mermaid tails, have continued this millennia-old pastime. The genesis of these mermaid diving courses is Dada Li, the world’s first Chinese woman to hold a Master Freediving training certification from PADI—shecreated the first professional underwater performance team composed of freedivers only. “I was inspired by an old movie called ‘Splash’ in the 1980s,” Li tells . “The heroine is a mermaid who lives in the sea… That image has lived in my head ever since.” “A mermaid tail ties both legs together so they can’t move freely, [so] we need to use our belly and waist to move like a dolphin. It requires practice to make this movement smooth and elegant like a real mermaid.” Since 2012, Li has been enchanted with freediving, a skillset that involves a deep understanding of human physiology, and one which doesn’t include any equipment but regular flippers and a pair of goggles with a snorkel. She was the first female freediving instructor in her home country of China, where she now holds . Li decided to use her skills to pursue her dream of becoming a mermaid, and in doing so she stumbled upon a growing sport which is now exploding in popularity worldwide. Standardized mermaiding (and mermanning for that matter) schools, techniques, and competitions have swept across the globe in the last decade, and the percentage of international diving licenses given out for mermaid diving will surpass all other kinds if the trend continues. Corinna Davids, head of development of the mermaid courses offered by SSI (Scuba Schools International), told CNN Travel they have mermaid diving programs in more than 3,000 diving schools worldwide, and more than 1,000 certified instructors in China alone. In 2015, after years of working to find, and then eventually to make, a functional “merfin,” she founded a performance diving team consisting entirely of mermaid divers to perform at aquariums and other watersport events in China. The market for performance mermaid diving is growing, not just in terms of licenses issued, which has helped diving license issuing grow by 40% in China in 2018, a rate eight-times the world average, but also for venue demands, as mega-resorts like pay regularly for live mermaid performances; recently they broke the Guinness world record for the largest ever.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/mermaid-diving-courses-china-are-growing-fast/
"Like any happy toddler, Ivy McLeod is full of smiles and filled with wonder as she discovers the world around her. Ivy’s favorite activity is coloring, but since she was born without hands, Ivy holds the markers between her toes to create her kiddy masterpieces. At age 2, Ivy’s mom Vanessa says her daughter isn’t fully aware of the reason other kids have hands and she doesn’t. She knows it’s only a matter of time before Ivy is going to start asking some tough questions. To prepare for the inevitable conversation, McLeod came up with the idea of getting Ivy a puppy that had similar limb differences as a way to show that being different and being beautiful aren’t mutually exclusive. She wanted to be able to tell Ivy: “You know you were born that way but different is beautiful and this puppy was also born that way and that is also a beautiful thing,” McLeod explained in an interview with .

"One doesn’t need Good News Network to tell them there are a lot of people whose minds and moods have been darkened by the last 14 months. The mental health crisis that many immediately saw as a great threat from government-enforced business closures, quarantines, and travel restrictions was a very real thing before COVID-19, and as a report from global medical care knowledge provider states, 2018 saw over 70 million prescriptions for antidepressants written in the U.S., compared to just 36 million ten years before. Yet Norman Rosenthal M.D., a renowned figure in the psychiatry field, is tackling both crises with a different kind of prescription: a little bit of “Do not go gentle into that good night,” or a 30-day course of “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.” Having just released “You know, as an adolescent, as a teenager, I wrote poetry and I loved it, but truly I was not destined to become a poet,” Dr. Rosenthal told “But luckily, even though I could not produce wonderful poetry, I could always appreciate it, not just intellectually, but for the emotional gifts it presents.” Separated into five parts, titled: Loving and Losing, That Inward Eye, The Human Experience, A Design for Living and the Search for Meaning, and Into the Night, Rosenthal offers a variety of literary keys to unlock the words needed for one’s inner dialogue to start, fortify, or complete the healing process of trauma, grief, or perhaps the general COVID-19 malaise. “Over the years I collected poems I found either were wonderfully helpful to me, or to my patients or clients, and the effect of that is that I had this collection and I thought, ‘you know that would make a wonderful book’.” The pandemic, as for so many of us, offered the time and the seclusion required for Rosenthal to organize these poems into the different parts and write all the accompanying stories, including brief bios on the poets, and excerpts from friends’ and clients’ experiences with the poems. “I might prescribe exercise, I might prescribe meditation, I might prescribe rest… and in that sense I could also prescribe a poem, they’re [clients] not going to go to a pharmacy but they could take it as a serious suggestion,” says Rosenthal. As the book has made its rounds along the PR circuit, it’s won the praise of “High Priestess of Health” Jane Brody, who for over 40 years has been their personal health columnist. “The special beauty of Dr. Rosenthal’s book for me is his discussion of what each poem is saying, what the poet was likely feeling, and often how the poems helped him personally, as when he left his birth family in South Africa for a rewarding career in the United States,” she . “The wonderful thing about poems are they’re relatively short, so in just a few minutes, you can read, enjoy, appreciate, and benefit from a poem; as such they can often be squeezed in between all the things of a busy life,” says Rosenthal, whose extensive body of work also includes a publication on the practice of transcendental meditation, and the pioneering of the understanding and treatment of seasonal affective disorder. The collected poems, largely originating from the English poets, include not only ones which he or his friends and family have enjoyed, but ones that he uses in his psychiatric practice. In particular he told GNN of a Rumi passage, pulled from memory, which he often reads with clients having marriage difficulties. “When the poet says, ‘I’ll meet you there,’ he’s making the first move, he wants to make things better, he wants to suggest taking the squabble to a different plain, to a plain of sharing,” explains Rosenthal. “I personally take information in in chunks, and I think a lot of people do especially these days, very few people have time to read or ,” says Rosenthal “We like to get information in satisfying chunks, so I thought it would be more digestible if I broke it down into logical groupings.” really does work like a 30-day prescription, with poems and the related commentary satisfying a day’s worth of ponderances, while being grouped together in various stages of the emotional journey of life, one can jump around to whichever words are needed at a particular time. Another way to look at it might be as a poetry Almanac, giving the book tremendous re-reading potential, as there’s no guarantee a reader would relate to all of the content in a single period of their lives. “Loving and Losing was an obvious first [section], poems are things to which we turn when we’re in or out of love. They console us when we’re our of love and they enliven us when we’re in love,” he says. “The second one is responsiveness to nature, because poets tend to be extremely sensitive to their surroundings.” “Above all, it’s [a book] about human beings and how to experience your life in a way that enhances it, and if you’re suffering in some way, alleviates that pain.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/psychiatrist-rosenthal-writes-prescriptions-for-daily-poetry-reading/
"As India grapples with an unprecedented new wave of COVID-19, one of the country’s major companies is working round-the-clock to get free oxygen out to people in need. Traditionally, Reliance Industries is not a manufacturer of medical-grade liquid oxygen. But over a year into the pandemic, the company—which is owned by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani—has gone on to become the nation’s largest producer from a single location, supplying over 55,000 MT of medical-grade liquid oxygen to people since March 2020. At its refinery-cum-petrochemical complex in Jamnagar and other facilities, Reliance is producing over 1000 MT of medical-grade liquid oxygen per day—or over 11% of India’s total production—meeting the needs of nearly every 1 in 10 patients needing the life-saving treatment across the nation. “Nothing is more important than saving every life as India battles against a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Chairman Mukesh Ambani said . The switch-over to producing high-purity medical grade oxygen hasn’t been too difficult for Reliance engineers—the main facility is already designed for refining and petrochemicals-grade oxygen. That said, medical grade oxygen has to be produced in liquid form at -183°C with almost 99.5% purity, which poses extraordinary challenges and risks in production and maximizing tonnage. “I am proud of our engineers at Jamnagar who have worked tirelessly, with a great sense of patriotic urgency, to meet this new challenge… [They’ve] risen to the occasion and delivered when India needs it the most,” said Ambani of his staff, who are now bringing immediate relief to over 100,000 COVID-19 patients on a daily basis.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/donate-oxygen-india-covid-patients-mukesh-ambani/
"A brave 11-year-old boy who was told he’d never speak has been honored in a Disney storybook all about kindness. Zac Du Boulay, who was born with Moebius Syndrome, won $5,000 in a recent ‘Inspire Like Churchill’ speech competition, but decided to donate all his winnings to Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity. “I didn’t want the [sick children’s] parents to be sad or lonely, so I wanted to help,” he said of his generosity. Now Zac has been honored by Disney—in its just-launched a digital storybook collection. 14 young people from around the world have been given dedications in the storybooks, which feature 14 original Disney Princess stories aimed at inspiring children to help create a kinder world. Zac was born with facial and oral paralysis which left him unable to breathe or eat. “I put so much time and effort into trying to speak, and I did the impossible, I proved the doctors wrong,” said Zac. “I didn’t worry about people bullying me, I kept strong in my heart. “I’ve always been determined, kept strong, and tried not to worry about anything. ‘Hakuna-matata’, as they say in Disney’s .” Zac’s mom spoke of the difficulties the family faced when he was born: “Zac spent his first five months fighting for his life in intensive care. “We were then trained by intensive care nurses to care for him at home, where we were resuscitating him several times a day under emergency conditions, so life as a family was very stressful and restrictive. “However, Zac is a fighter. He defied all the odds, firstly, by surviving. Then on Christmas Day, when he was three years old, he said his first word. ‘Mama’. “It was the first sound he had ever made other than crying and laughing. From that moment on, he was on a mission to teach himself to speak. Then, once his airway had stabilized somewhat, he was determined not only to speak, but to teach himself how to eat orally. “So we had another couple of stressful years, finding him raiding the fridge and choking on food, until he worked out a way in which to eat despite the nerve palsy to his face, mouth, and throat. “Similar to his incessant talking, he now never stops eating either,” she joked. And now? Zac loves using his own experiences to support other children and help them to overcome challenges like he has. “I feel amazing, excited, happy, and proud to be honored [by Disney]” he said. “It has inspired me to keep on doing what I’m doing, giving more speeches, and hopefully inspiring more people.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/zac-du-boulay-moebius-syndrome-disney-dedication-pochahontas/
"In the real world, falling in love isn’t usually an adventure that literally begins with a daring ocean rescue—but sometimes that’s exactly how a story unfolds. In February 2019, yoga instructor Nupur Gupta was swimming in the waters off a beach in Goa when the current got the better of her. While a strong swimmer, she feared she’d be unable to make it back to shore. Hope came in the form of Hungarian-born financial adviser Attila Bosnyak, who’d spied his soon-true-love-to-be in trouble and was swimming to her aid. Though a capable swimmer, once he reached Gupta, Bosnyak realized he wouldn’t be able to get both of them to safety on his own. Rather than towing Gupta in, he swam toward a nearby rock formation. After several attempts in which he was pounded by fierce waves and smashed against the rocks, he was able to climb up and signal to the lifeguards on shore for help. Once he saw a guard making a beeline for Gupta, a bleeding Bosnyak, who’d suffered numerous scrapes and bruises, swam back to shore and collapsed on a beach chair. A grateful Gupta, who’d quickly bounced back from her own ordeal, felt compelled to help the stranger who’d saved her life. Swiftly procuring first-aid supplies—and chocolate ice-cream as a thank you—she returned to her hero’s side. After tending to his injuries, she tendered him the ice cream. Some might blame it on the chocolate, but in that instant, Gupta’s emotional landscape underwent a sea change—and she wasn’t the only one. Bosnyak felt the “magic” surge of attraction, too. Gupta and Bosnyak were both staying at the same yoga resort; she, as a teacher and he, as a student (though not in any of her advanced classes). Over the course of the next few days, the promising relationship began taking shape. However, since the retreat was soon to end and each was scheduled to go back to their respective lives—for Bosnyak, that meant his job in the Netherlands and for Gupta, home to Kerala—it looked as if the budding romance might never get a chance to blossom. But the pair of them decided to take a chance on love. Putting their real lives on hold for another week, the couple spent Valentine’s Day together. In the coming months, thanks to social media, their bond continued to grow, albeit long distance. After a month of back and forth, Bosnyak knew he wanted to see where the relationship could go. He asked Gupta how she felt. She too wanted to move ahead. “I immediately agreed without any second thoughts, despite knowing that it’s a huge distance, different cultures, continents, countries, cities,” she told . “I wanted to do this. I mean, I wanted to have this experience. I loved his vibe for that time when I was around him and I was very happy.” While the sweethearts hoped to meet in person for some quality couple time, plans for a vacation had to be put on hold when it was learned Gupta’s mother required emergency surgery for a brain tumor. After Gupta explained why she had to cancel their plans, without missing a beat, Bosnyak offered to fly there to be with her. Once Gupta’s mother recovered, the pair embarked on a series of meet-ups in Dubai, Serbia, and eventually, Thailand. The sites weren’t chosen for their romantic potential but by what their travel visas would allow. In September 2019, Gupta was granted a Dutch visa. She joined Bosnyak in the Netherlands and traveled with him to meet his family in Hungary. While it took her time to adapt to both the culture and the climate, in her heart, she knew the move might prove to be a permanent one—and it did. Bosnyak and Gupta were wed on March 21, 2020, at Trouwlocatie Groenmarkt which once served as city hall to The Hague. In fact, they were the last couple to marry at the prestigious site prior to the pandemic lockdown. The newlyweds spent the next few months pretty much exclusively in one another’s company. “It’s the acid test, I think, for a relationship,” Bosnyak told CNN. “That you can live with that person for months and months and months with no events around, no places to visit, no fun activities apart from the ones you can invent inside your apartment—or during your short walks in the next one and a half, two kilometers in your neighborhood. So if you can make it, and keep on your happiness, then that relationship is rock solid.” The couple’s road to a fairytale ending hasn’t been without its bumps, with Gupta recently contracting coronavirus. But she’s now on the mend, and she and Bosnyak are currently doing what they can to help friends and family as the pandemic continues to rage in India. Next summer, Gupta and Bosnyak, along with their dog, Sukhi Ram, should be moving to Athens where Bosynak has been offered a job. If all goes according to plan, it looks as if an addition to the family might be in the cards as well. And while “happily ever after” is never guaranteed, we think that for a real-life romantic tale that started out with soggy Prince Charming and a damsel in distress, that sounds pretty darn close.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nupur-gupta-attila-bosnyak-saved-her-from-drowning-love/

"In fishing lore, tall tales abound. Whether it’s ‘the one that got away’ or ‘the one that jumped right into the boat,’ pretty much every story involves a fisherman catching a fish—not the other way around. But in a plotline straight out of Disney, an adorable aquatic denizen of Japan’s Tateyama Bay has captured one man’s heart in a friendship that’s lasted close to three decades. Yoriko, an Asian sheepshead wrasse (kobudai in Japanese), first met scuba diver Hiroyuki Arakawa nearly 30 years ago when he was supervising the construction of an underwater Shinto temple gate 56 feet beneath the surface of the bay. Arakawa started diving at the age of 18. Now 79, he still loves his sojourns in the deep water. His longstanding kinship with Yoriko is certainly one of the highlights. “I’d say we understand each other,” Arakawa said in an interview for , “not that we talk to each other… I kissed her once. I’m the only person she’ll let do it.” Over time, the fish with an almost human-looking face—“When you look really close, you’ll think [she] looks like someone you know,” Arakawa jokes—and her human companion became UWBFFs (underwater best friends forever). On one dive when Arakawa was visiting, he noticed Yoriko’s mouth had been badly injured. Even so, she came to greet him. Realizing she’d be unable to catch her own food, Arakawa spent the next 10 days hand-feeding Yoriko meat from crabs he hammered open for her near the submerged temple gate. Thankfully, Yoriko bounced back from her injuries fairly quickly. After her recovery, the bond between the pair seemed to grow even stronger. “I’m not sure if it’s the nature of the kobudai or not. It’s probably because there is a sense of trust between us. I guess she knows that I saved her… that I helped when she was badly injured. So for me to be able to do that, I am proud,” Arakawa told . “I have an amazing sense of accomplishment in my heart.” It sure sounds like this is one human who’s been truly caught in a net of love—and we’ll bet Yoriko has no plans to toss him back, either.

"Belgium recently melted down over 22,000 firearms into 60 tons of recycled steel. Half of the firearms were collected from members of the Belgian public. The other half were police weapons that are no longer used.

"A Russian woman is trying to become the legal guardian of a friend she made while volunteering at a care home. 27-year old Nina Torgashova was admitted to a psycho-neurological care home when she was 18. Then, when COVID-19 hit Russia, a charity called Life Route lobbied to allow people at state-assisted living facilities to move out to apartments. They could be accompanied by volunteers, and that would help protect them from mass infection in facilities housing hundreds. 31-year-old Arina Muratova has been volunteering at Nina’s care home for years and the pair have always got along well. While Nina struggles with math and literacy, Arina noticed that she’s a really quick learner who’s well-adapted for day-to-day life. “Nina was a very active person at her care home,” Arina . “She took part in various creative activities: amateur dramatics, arts and crafts workshops. She took part in sporting competitions, too: she played darts, she played football. Football was something she really missed after leaving the home.” Once they moved into the flat together, their friendship blossomed like a meadow in spring. While admittedly nervous about taking Nina in—the pandemic has had its stresses for Arina: she had to take a pay cut, and has been working from home as a market research expert—she quickly found that her new best friend could cook, go shopping, and do most things on her own. Arina hired a math tutor to help Nina make calculations—a suddenly important skill given she was now shopping independently. She also started helping her with reading and writing by herself. After the lockdowns ended, the pair had a tough challenge ahead since Nina didn’t want to go back to her facility. And there were difficulties right off the bat: residents in Russia can’t be released from custody unless they are proven “functionally able,” or if someone takes legal guardianship over them. Then one day it just clicked. Arina started the process to adopt her pal. Currently Arina, who doesn’t count on being anything like a mom, is working on a plan to restore Nina’s legal right to full independence, which will require serious assessments of her capabilities, such as making sensible financial decisions. “Maybe I’m just the type of person that is not afraid of responsibility. It is an unexpected— but actually a good thing—that has happened to me,” she said. “I love her. There’s not much to it. I love her very much.” ( the BBC documentary about this amazing friendship below )",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nina-and-arina-russian-woman-tries-to-adopt-her-friend-to-keep-her-out-of-institutions/
"Some planes land late and others make it to the gate on time, but a recent flight from Salt Lake City to Honolulu is giving a whole new meaning to the term “early arrival.” When the plane took off, Lavinia “Lavi” Mounga was headed for a family vacation, but unbeknownst to even herself, that family was about to get one bouncing baby boy bigger. The soon-to-be mom had no idea she was already 29 weeks along. “I just didn’t know I was pregnant, and then Raymond (the baby) just came out of nowhere,” . Halfway through the fateful trip, the crew had to make an announcement seeking out medical personnel to help with the emergency. Serendipitously, the passenger manifest included not only Hawaii Pacific Health physician Dr. Dale Glenn, but a trio of neonatal nurses, Lani Bamfield, Amanda Beeding, and Mimi Ho, who all work at Missouri’s North Kansas City Hospital. Without proper neonatal equipment, Dr. Glenn and the nurses had to come up with some creative solutions to keep baby Raymond stable for the remainder of the three-hour flight. Thanks to a mixture of wilderness training and ingenuity involving shoelaces, microwaved warming bottles, and an Apple Watch heart monitor, the newborn made it to Hawaii in good form. “I don’t know how a patient gets so lucky as to have three neonatal intensive care nurses onboard the same flight when she is in emergency labor, but that was the situation we were in,” Dr. Glenn relayed in a . “The great thing about this was the teamwork. Everybody jumped in together and everyone helped out.” Passenger Julia Hansen captured the blessed event for posterity with a TikTok video that includes a rousing round of applause for mom, baby, and her medical guardian angels, and by viewers around the world.

"At the age of 60, Chen Lie suffered a hemorrhagic stroke which arrived “without my invitation or permission.” But the temporary paralysis of her entire right side gave her an opportunity to blossom on her left side. Without invitation or expectation, a startling new skill would change her life. As part of her recovery she had to re-learn how to do everything—from brushing her teeth to using a fork or pen—with her left hand, resulting in much frustration. One day in a fit of boredom, and for the first time in her life, she picked up one of her grandchild’s paint brushes and just started putting color on the canvass. Happiness dawned on Chen as she suddenly could paint lovely natural scenery, despite having never painted or practiced a day in her life. “I never picked up the paint brush before,” Chen told . “I had nothing else to do so I just picked up the paint brush, and I just tried to put the color on the paper.” After her 2017 stroke, Chen completed in-patient therapy in Texas before moving to New York to enroll in an experimental robotic-assisted therapy program at the on Long Island in late 2018. The robotic arm essentially allowed Chen to complete far more repetitions in physical therapy then would be possible without it, allowing her to regain movement faster. “Every time we recovered something [during rehab] we would tell them the good news,” Chen said. “They thought it was a wonder I could do something like painting.” : Chen—whose favorite painters include America’s beloved —has completed a whopping 500 paintings to date. During the month of May, which is National Stroke Awareness Month, she is painting one every day and posting a picture of it on her professional artist/advocacy Facebook page, , to help raise awareness. “Actually, at the beginning I just put the colors on the canvass and then the more and more I did it, I read about how to paint, I read about color; it’s a lot of research for me to do,” says Chen, who considers it something like an occupation at this point. “I’ve gained a lot of knowledge, so besides the hand painting, the brain keeps thinking; that’s good for stroke [victims] to not let the brain rest; keep thinking; keep searching for the knowledge.” The influence of Bob Ross is there to see in a professional video her family made telling her story, while she uses “the ole’ fan brush,” as the gentle man himself used to say, to effortlessly paint evergreen trees covered in snow. The first post she made on Facebook was of an image of Cabo San Lucas in Mexico City, which she described as “top of my travel list.” “I’ve never seen her paint,” says Chen’s daughter Liana. “Growing up she was always busy working, I never even saw her have a minute to do any of her hobbies.

"Researchers have used carbon dots, created from human hair waste sourced from a barbershop, to create a kind of ‘armor’ to improve the performance of cutting-edge solar technology. In a study the researchers led by Professor Hongxia Wang in collaboration with Associate Professor Prashant Sonar of QUT’s Centre for Materials Science showed the carbon nanodots could be used to improve the performance of perovskites solar cells. Perovskites solar cells, a relatively new photovoltaic technology, are seen as the best PV candidate to deliver low-cost, highly efficient solar electricity in coming years. They have proven to be as effective in power conversion efficiency as the current commercially available monocrystalline silicon solar cells, but the hurdles for researchers in this area is to make the technology cheaper and more stable. Unlike silicon cells, they are created with a compound that is easily manufactured, and as they are flexible they could be used in scenarios such as solar-powered clothing, backpacks that charge your devices on the go and even tents that could serve as standalone power sources. This is the second major piece of research to come as a result of a human hair derived carbon dots as multifunctional material. Last year, Associate Professor Prashant Sonar led a research team, including Centre for Materials Science research fellow Amandeep Singh Pannu, that turned hair scraps into carbon nanodots by breaking down the hairs and then burning them at 240 degrees celsius. In that study, the researchers showed the carbon dots could be turned into flexible displays that could be used in future smart devices. In this new study, Professor Wang’s research team, including Dr Ngoc Duy Pham, and Mr Pannu, working with Professor Prashant Sonar’s group, used the carbon nanodots on perovskite solar cells out of curiosity. Professor Wang’s team had previously found that nanostructured carbon materials could be used to improve a cell’s performance. After adding a solution of carbon dots into the process of making the perovskites, Professor Wang’s team found the carbon dots forming a wave-like perovskite layer where the perovskite crystals are surrounded by the carbon dots. “It creates a kind of protective layer, a kind of armour,” Professor Wang said. “It protects the perovskite material from moisture or other environmental factors, which can cause damage to the materials.” The study found that perovskite solar cells covered with the carbon dots had a higher power conversion efficiency and a greater stability than perovskite cells without the carbon dots. Professor Wang has been researching advanced solar cells for about 20 years, and working with perovskite cells since they were invented about a decade ago, with the primary objective of developing cost-effective, stable photovoltaics materials and devices, to help solve the energy issue in the world. “Our final target is to make solar electricity cheaper, easier to access, longer lasting and to make PV devices lightweight because current solar cells are very heavy,” Professor Wang said. “The big challenges in the area of perovskite solar cells are solving stability of the device to be able to operate for 20 years or longer and the development of a manufacturing method that is suitable for large scale production. “Currently, all the reported high-performance perovskite solar cells have been made in a controlled environment with extremely low level of moisture and oxygen, with a very small cell area which are practically unfeasible for commercialization. “To make the technology commercially viable, challenges for fabrication of efficient large area, stable, flexible, perovskite solar panels at low cost needs to be overcome. “This can only be achieved through a deep understanding of the material properties in large-scale production and under industrially compatible conditions.” Professor Wang is particularly interested in how perovskite cells could be used in the future to power spacecrafts. The International Space Station is powered by four solar arrays, which can generate up to 120 kW of electricity. But one disadvantage of the current technology of space PVs is the weight of the payload to get them there. While perovskite would be much lighter, one of the challenges for researchers is to develop perovskite cells able to cope with the extreme radiation and broad range of temperature variation in space—from minus 185 degrees to more than 150 degrees Celsius. Professor Wang said the solution could be ten years off, but researchers were continuing to gain greater insights in the area. Currently Professor Wang’s research team is collaborating with Professor Dmitri Golberg in the QUT Centre for Materials Science to understand the properties of perovskite materials under extreme environmental conditions such as strong irradiation of an electron beam and drastic temperature change. “I’m quite optimistic given how much this technology has improved so far,” Professor Wang said.

He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Taurus poet writes, “Why is the word yes so brief? It should be the longest, the hardest, so that you could not decide in an instant to say it, so that upon reflection you could stop in the middle of saying it.” I suppose it makes sense for her to express such an attitude, given the fact that she never had a happy experience until she was 20 years old, and that furthermore, this happiness was “unbearable.” (She confessed these sad truths in an interview.) But I hope you won’t adopt her hard-edged skepticism toward YES anytime soon, Taurus. In my view, it’s time for you to become a connoisseur of YES, a brave explorer of the bright mysteries of YES, an exuberant perpetrator of YES. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): In indigenous cultures from West Africa to Finland to China, folklore describes foxes as crafty tricksters with magical powers. Sometimes they’re thought of as perpetrators of pranks, but more often they are considered helpful messengers or intelligent allies. I propose that you regard the fox as your spirit creature for the foreseeable future. I think you will benefit from the influence of your inner fox—the wild part of you that is ingenious, cunning, and resourceful. CANCER (June 21-July 22): “The universe conspires in your favor,” writes author . “It consistently places before you the right and perfect people, circumstances, and situations with which to answer life’s only question: ‘Who are you?'” In my book , I say much the same thing, although I mention two further questions that life regularly asks, which are: 1. What can you do next to liberate yourself from some of your suffering? 2. What can you do next to reduce the suffering of others, even by a little? As you enter a phase when you’ll get ample cosmic help in diminishing suffering and defining who you are, I hope you meditate on these questions every day. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): The poet wrote a letter to a Benedictine monk whose real identity she kept secret from the rest of us. She told him, “There are a few great souls in my life. They are not many. They are few. You are one.” In this spirit, Leo, and in accordance with astrological omens, I invite you to take an inventory of the great souls in your life: the people you admire and respect and learn from and feel grateful for; people with high integrity and noble intentions; people who are generous with their precious gifts. When you’ve compiled your list, I encourage you to do as Sexton did: Express your appreciation; perhaps even send no-strings-attached gifts. Doing these things will have a profoundly healing effect on you. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): “It’s a temptation for any intelligent person to try to murder the primitive, emotive, appetitive self,” writes author . “But that is a mistake. Because it is dangerous to ignore the existence of the irrational.” I’m sending this message out to you, Virgo, because in the coming weeks it will be crucial for you to honor the parts of your life that can’t be managed through rational thought alone. I suggest you have sacred fun as you exult in the mysterious, welcome the numinous, explore the wildness within you, unrepress big feelings you’ve buried, and marvel adoringly about your deepest yearnings.

We may need to strip naked and let the petals fall on our shoulders, down our bellies, against our thighs. We may need to lie naked in fields of wildflowers. We may need to walk naked through beauty. We may need to walk naked through color. We may need to walk naked through scent.” SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): As Scorpio author reminds us, “Water is not a solid wall; it will not stop you. But water always goes where it wants to go, and nothing in the end can stand against it.” According to my reading of the astrological omens, being like water will be an excellent strategy for you to embrace during the coming weeks. “Water is patient,” Atwood continues. “Dripping water wears away a stone. Remember you are half water. If you can’t go through an obstacle, go around it. Water does.” SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): In a letter to a friend in 1856, Sagittarian poet confessed she was feeling discombobulated because of a recent move to a new home. She hoped she would soon regain her bearings. “I am out with lanterns, looking for myself,” she quipped, adding that she couldn’t help laughing at her disorientation. She signed the letter “From your mad Emilie,” intentionally misspelling her own name. I’d love it if you approached your current doubt and uncertainty with a similar light-heartedness and poise. (PS: Soon after writing this letter, Dickinson began her career as a poet in earnest, reading extensively and finishing an average of one poem every day for many years.) CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Now is a favorable time to celebrate both life’s changeableness and your own. The way we are all constantly called on to adjust to unceasing transformations can sometimes be a wearying chore, but I suspect it could be at least interesting and possibly even exhilarating for you in the coming weeks. For inspiration, study this message from the “Welcome to Night Vale” podcast: “You are never the same twice, and much of your unhappiness comes from trying to pretend that you are. Accept that you are different each day, and do so joyfully, recognizing it for the gift it is. Work within the desires and goals of the person you are currently, until you aren’t that person anymore.” AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Aquarian author described two varieties of loneliness. The first “is a loneliness that can be rocked. Arms crossed, knees drawn up; holding, holding on, this motion smooths and contains the rocker.” The second “is a loneliness that roams. No rocking can hold it down. It is alive, on its own.” Neither kind is better or worse, of course, and both are sometimes necessary as a strategy for self-renewal—as a means for deepening and fine-tuning one’s relationship with oneself. I recommend either or both for you in the coming weeks. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): The valet to England’s Prince Charles puts toothpaste on his toothbrush and washes all of his clothes by hand. I could conceivably interpret the current astrological omens to mean that you should pursue similar behavior in the coming weeks. I could, but I won’t. Instead, I will suggest that you solicit help about truly important matters, not meaningless trivia like shoelace ironing. For example, I urge you to ask for the support you need as you build bridges, seek harmony, and make interesting connections. ARIES (March 21-April 19): Created by Leonardo da Vinci in the 16th century, the is one of the world’s most famous paintings. It’s hanging in the Louvre museum in Paris. In that same museum is a less renowned version of the Mona Lisa. It depicts the same woman, but she’s unclothed. Made by da Vinci’s student. Renaissance artists commonly created “heavenly” and “vulgar” versions of the same subject. I suggest that in the coming weeks you opt favoring what’s earthy, raw, and unadorned—over what’s spectacular, idealized, and polished—as your metaphor of power.

"Sheep were grazing the University of California–Davis campus this week in an academic experiment to see if the ewes can eat weeds and grass, fertilize, and control pests, as well as—or better than—using conventional landscaping methods. The woolly ewes are part of a multidisciplinary study to explore the possibilities of saving the campus money and resources at the same time. “My interest is taking the science on green infrastructure and sustainability and designing it so it’s interactive, beautiful and practical,” said A. Haven Kiers, assistant professor of landscape architecture in the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, who is leading the project. Kiers has hired student sheepherders to watch over the sheep’s three-day stay on the grassy area along Old Davis Road, adjacent to the UC Davis Arboretum. : Kiers is a longtime proponent of green infrastructure such as green roofs you can grow plants on, and urban landscapes that are aesthetically pleasing as well as ecologically productive. The grazing sheep pilot project is a natural outgrowth of that research. She said she is bringing to the campus her concept of Nature HEALS (for health, engagement, aesthetics, landscapes and sustainability) to emulate a historical practice throughout France—and even at the White House and in Central Park—and bring a pastoral setting to UC Davis, and hopefully spawn that idea for other campuses and municipalities at a grander scale. The sheep put in a full day’s work from Wednesday to Friday this week, snacking from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. For the control, the adjacent traditionally-landscaped acre of grassland was maintained by campus in the usual way. The grass height and condition will be assessed on each site before and after grazing. : There are four breeds of sheep, that are all being used for their wool, taking part in the study: Suffolk, Hampshire, Southdown and Dorset, , who manages the sheep for UC Davis. No worries about cleanup, either. “It (the manure) only stays for 10 days, and it actually attracts insects that are beneficial for the landscape.” a Reuters video on the project… In a proposal she presented to campus, Kiers said, “Sheep can eliminate invasive plants and restore native grasses, reduce carbon emissions, introduce beneficial insects attracted to their waste products, and improve soil health without compacting the soil. Culturally, the addition of sheep to a green space can add pastoral beauty to a site, provide a sense of place, inspire urban agritourism, serve as a living educational tool, and promote mental health.” : There is however, little peer-reviewed evidence to support those claims as they apply to urban lawn landscapes, she added. Kiers aims to change that with her research, which will continue intermittently throughout the summer—and she hopes to spread the idea to other parts of campus—and the world—in the future.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/sheep-vs-lawnmowers-on-uc-davis-campus/
"These days, heroes come with face masks instead of capes—but a luxury resort chain in Mexico has rewarded 100 health care superheroes with free spa vacations to say thank you for their great hearts during the worldwide pandemic. The last year of COVID has put their professionalism, resilience, and determination to be of help to others on full display. As a token of appreciation for all their hard work—and even putting their lives at risk—Velas Resorts is giving 100 healthcare heroes a much-deserve vacation on a Mexican beach. During April the public voted for their favorite stories among 350 nominations, choosing who would get the chance for an all-inclusive stay of 4 days and 3 nights in the luxury resort, with food and drinks prepared by its premiere chefs and restaurants. The campaign, called “Let’s Be Thankful” unearthed heartwarming and inspiring stories included that of M. Snider, a practitioner nurse, and mother of two daughters, 3 and 5, who has worked extra shifts to cover colleagues having Covid-19 causing her to miss valuable time with her children in their younger years. : The voting period closed on April 30th and last week the 100 heroes were announced, and received their vouchers for the Velas Vallarta resort in Puerto Vallarta. Other Velas resort properties include Los Cabos (pictured bleow), Riviera Maya, and Riviera Nayarit. Mexican airline Aeromexico joined in the initiative to give away roundtrip flights for the medical personnel chosen. Carlos Alberto Espinoza Casillas was one of the winners.

"A new project to demine seven million square meters of land, including a critical area inside the largest contiguous wildlife area in the world, is underway, thanks to a grant from the U.S. Government. Removing the landmines laid four decades ago will help protect African species such as elephants, pangolins, and lions in a wildlife corridor that spans South Africa, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. The Dutch organization called APOPO (translated to English as Anti-Personnel Landmines Detection Product Development) has been tasked by the Zimbabwean government with clearing the dense minefield that includes the massive wildlife corridor inside the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, an effort that will also support opening up eco-tourism opportunities. The grant allows APOPO to protect not only animals in the Sengwe Wildlife Corridor but also the local human populations and their livestock. With additional funding, APOPO aims to finish clearing the minefield by Zimbabwe’s 2025 landmine-free deadline. APOPO is the global non-profit best known for having to detect landmines for over 20 years—but in this effort they are using manual deminers more appropriate for the dense minefields in the Sengwe frontier. “We are very enthusiastic and honored to take part in clearing the heavily mined areas along the Zimbabwe, Mozambique border to allow not only local communities use their land freely and without fear, but to allow safe movement for endangered wildlife and support overall conservation efforts,” said the Zimbabwe Program Manager for . : The group has already cleared 45,000 square meters, and estimates it will find and destroy about 15,300 anti-personnel landmines planted during the 1970s Zimbabwe Liberation War by the Rhodesian Army which wanted to protect their border—laying about 2,500 mines per kilometer. Tens of thousands of people live in close proximity to these landmines, which limit their access to resources such as water, grazing areas, and roads. One of the poorest, driest areas in Zimbabwe, up to 100 cattle are lost on this minefield each year, pushing some households into poverty. : The wildlife corridor extends into the famous Kruger National Park in South Africa, and Zimbabwe’s Gonarezhou National Park. Kruger receives a massive influx of tourists (over 1.8 million visitors each year), which could potentially travel up the Sengwe Corridor and into Gonarezhou, which currently receives virtually no international tourists. If even a small fraction of the Kruger tourists made it to Gonarezhou, the positive economic implications for Zimbabwe would be significant. : Zimbabwe is a USAID Resilience Focus country where the American government agency provides economic opportunities for communities that are susceptible to climate change and significant economic stresses, while conserving natural resources for sustainable livelihoods.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/us-grant-kicks-off-demining-in-largest-conservation-corridor/
"If you found out someone you loved only had months to live, you’d likely move heaven and earth to be with them. Unfortunately, in the complex era of coronavirus, heaven and earth are all too often mired in a sea of red tape. Bus driver Aaron Wylie lives in Halifax, Nova Scotia. His mom, Sandra, who has liver disease, lives with his dad a four-hour drive away in Saint John, New Brunswick. He hasn’t seen them since Christmas of 2019. Devastated when he learned Sandra’s prognosis was terminal, all Wylie wanted to do was find a way to see her while there was still time, but with pandemic travel restrictions and mandatory quarantine paired with budget constraints and lack of time off, it looked as if the visit might be pretty much impossible. Then he got an idea. Wylie, who drives a bus for Halifax Transit in Nova Scotia, has a Class-1 license—which allows him to drive a truck. Since truck drivers are classed as essential workers, he thought if he could score a gig delivering a payload to New Brunswick, he might just be able to make the trip happen after all. Hoping for a miracle, he placed an ad on Canada’s popular classified network site Kijiji. “I know this is a bit of an odd request but I’m looking for a class 1 position,” he wrote. “I have Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday off—I work full-time at Halifax Transit. I am looking for a route that will run Halifax to Saint John… I am willing to drive for free!” He went on to explain the details of his mom’s diagnosis and said he needed to find a way to cross the border, both legally and as soon as possible. Wylie admits he wasn’t expecting a lot of feedback on his post, but almost at once, offers of trucking jobs, financial help—and even someone willing to test as a live liver donor for his mom—began streaming in. The request got more than 5,000 shares on Facebook, and the response was so overwhelming, Wylie had to turn off his phone and take down the Kijiji post. Wylie has since taken up an offer to haul cars from Halifax to Saint John, but he’s yet to receive clearance to travel. In the meantime, he’s getting vaccinated and plans to be tested for COVID-19 before and after making the trip. Canadian health restrictions are currently in flux. Rules and restrictions change from day to day, hour to hour. Even as Wylie anxiously awaits the go-ahead, he’s humbled by the outpouring of encouragement he’s received from total strangers thus far. “It’s been an overwhelming response and an emotional one,” Wylie said in an interview with . “I was just blown away.

"The birth of three litters of critically endangered American red wolves happened recently in North Carolina—and they were born just three days apart. All pups and their mothers are healthy and doing well—with this the first time in the history of the North Carolina Zoo’s red wolf breeding program that a trio of litters was born in one spring. The newest pups bring the number of red wolves currently in the Asheboro-based program to 36—making it the second-largest pack in the U.S. after Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium in Washington state. Only 15-20 red wolves remain in the wild, and they’re all in eastern North Carolina. Currently, they’re considered the most endangered canid in the world. For the first time in two decades, one of the litters was born on the red wolf public habitat—to parents Flint and Sassy—giving zoo guests a rare chance to view the pups for a limited time. The pups most likely will be visible starting in mid-June, when they begin to venture outside of the den. The wolf family will be moved to the non-public breeding area when the pups are older and weaned from their mother. The other two litters were born in non-public viewing areas of the zoo. “Congratulations to the North Carolina Zoo for playing an essential part in the survival of this critically endangered species,” said Secretary Reid Wilson, N.C. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, . “These births are important because many of our wolves, once matured, have been moved to other breeding packs to continue to help bring this species back from near extinction. Our hope is that more and more red wolves can soon be placed into the wild.” Now it’s up to the public to name the litters—with the zoo promising to release a poll in the next month.

"Off the coast of New Zealand, a group of marine biologists has discovered a mother bottlenose dolphin that had adopted a baby pilot whale. The Kiwi-based discovered the mammals sailing in the Bay of Islands in Northern New Zealand, and has now documented the pair on two separate occasions five weeks apart. While it’s not unheard of that dolphins adopt other species’ babies, it’s very rare to record the phenomenon with such a significant difference in species size. Bottlenose dolphins can reach 300 kilograms, which is no small fry—except that pilot whales can grow to two tons and reach six meters in length. “She might have lost her own calf,” researcher Jochen Zaeschmar of the dolphin’s behavior. The Independent in 2019 that researchers in French Polynesia found a bottlenose dolphin that had adopted a melon-headed whale calf, and that the pair stayed together for three years. Scientists don’t know why exactly this happens, and hypotheses exist that it’s misplaced mothering instinct—perhaps accentuated if a dolphin mother has lost her calf and finds a calf who has lost its mother. However the researchers in French Polynesia, pondering in their published paper on the finding, suggested it could be part of the mother’s “personality,” which is an endearing thought. Regardless of what brings them together, these cases of adoption only last as long as the weening stage, as whales and dolphins hunting patterns are so different—and at that point the adopted whale makes it off into the world alone.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/new-zealand-bottlenose-dolphin-mother-adopts-pilot-whale-calf/
"An evolutionary theorist has set out to prove that plants can hear their surroundings, and she was right; they can. Her work, not yet peer-reviewed, but available in a preprint repository, looked at the flowers of the evening primrose and used sound tests to prove they responded to the sound of bees’ wings by increasing the sugar quantity in their nectar. Reasoning that pollinators and flowers have co-evolved over a very, very long time, and that the world is completely saturated with sounds, Lilach Hadany, who teaches at the intersections between mathematics and biology at the University of Tel Aviv, felt it wouldn’t make any sense for plants to ignore them. Any living creature must make use of all its senses to survive until it can reproduce, and if one takes a moment to imagine how long a deaf or blind wildebeest would last on the Serengeti, they can see where Hadany is coming from. To test her premise—that sound is an abundant natural resource that greatly aids in the quest to survive and thrive, Hadany subjected the flowers of the evening primrose to five  sound tests consisting of three different computer-generated frequencies, silence, and the recording of a honeybee’s wingbeats. Silence, which they achieved by placing a jar over the flower, computer generated high-frequency notes at 158 to 160 kilohertz, and intermediate-frequency notes at 34 to 35 kilohertz, all had no effect on the flower— . However with the ultra-low frequency and the bee wingbeats, the flower spent the following three minutes increasing the sugar content in its nectar by 17-20%, a remarkably clear suggestion that Hadany’s hypothesis was right. A flower with more nectar is more likely to be detected and visited by pollinators, and Hadany’s team found that pollinators were nine times more likely to choose to visit a flower that had been visited by another pollinator within the last six minutes, showing how valuable that small increase in sugar could be for the flower’s chances of reproduction. “We were quite surprised when we found out that it actually worked,” Hadany told . “But after repeating it in other situations, in different seasons, and with plants grown both indoors and outdoors, we feel very confident in the result.” As Hadany and her colleagues thought about the nature of sound and flowers, it hit them that a great many flowers are concave, tubular, or bowl shaped—all perfect forms for attracting sound and vibrations. Amphitheaters, sub-woofers, ears, and radar dishes all share these properties. In fact, using tools to measure minute vibrations, they discovered that vibrations entering into the primroses increased in strength as a function of the shape of the flower petals, which if distorted or removed, cancelled out the effect. On a different note, another found that when the sound of caterpillars eating leaves was played next to a plant from the same family as mustard, they were later found to have flooded their leaves with a chemical caterpillar deterrent compared to those that heard only silence. These two papers have helped open up a relatively new field of study—phytoacoustics, the study of plants’ interactions with sound. As this is World Bee Day, it’s important to likewise recognize the importance of their food source, especially when selecting which species to plant in your yard or balcony—perhaps those with radar dish-like flowers?",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/flowers-can-hear-bees-and-it-makes-their-nectar-sweeter/
"Mosquitoes are one of the deadliest animals on the planet because they spread yellow fever, dengue, encephalitis, and malaria, which killed 400,000 people in 2019. Now, clinical trials of the promising R21 vaccine in Burkina Faso may be an effective tool against the disease, as it triggers the body’s immune system to attack the parasite—and has been 77% effective in phase 2 trials. Ravaging and replicating through the body in seven different stages, malaria comes from the parasite which isn’t a particularly good candidate for vaccination (mosquito nets are still the most effective measure), due to constant evolution throughout its life cycle. For perspective, it’s made from 5,000 genes, while the coronavirus that’s impacted all our lives contains just 16. In the ’80s, the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline attempted to use vaccination to tackle the malaria epidemic by targeting the initial stage of the life cycle, called a sporozoite. In 1983, according to , researchers discovered that sporozoites are covered in proteins that provoke a strong immune system response, but the evolution to their next life cycle occurs too fast for natural immunity to recognize and terminate the sporozoites. The idea was to make a carrier that would present a kind of sporozoite protein-punching bag, so that when the real thing arrived the immune system would react fast enough to eradicate it before it spread to the liver. Marketed commercially as , it’s the single-most tested vaccine candidate for malaria, but after twelve months, its effectiveness falls to less than sleeping under mosquito nets. Halidou Tinto, an epidemiologist and expert in Malaria, works near the Burkina Faso capital of Ouagadougou and helped to organize a trial of 450 children between 5-17 years of age for the new R21 vaccine, that uses the same method as Mosquirix, but simply manufactured better—where before only one in five proteins were coated in the sporozoite protein, R21 made that five in five. At its best, R21 by 77%, 2% more than the 75% target set out by the WHO in 2013 as part of an international attempt to push the global malaria problem more into mainstream pharmacology. There was no difference in malaria incidence at a 6 or a 12-month follow-up; a significant improvement over the old GSK vaccine. The authors of this paper noted that the vaccine doses were administered in the lead up to the annual rainy season, when malaria cases spike, but that it would be worth comparing results from trials carried out at different times of the year. “We are enthusiastic, but we still need phase three trials to confirm the efficacy and the safety of the vaccine before we move on,” Tinto tells National Geographic.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/new-malaria-vaccine-tested-in-burkina-faso-shows-75-percent-efficacy/

"“When one door closes,” the saying goes, “another door opens.” For one very special pooch, it appears that adage also applies to doggie-doors. A Labrador-retriever mix named Sheldon was enrolled in a program to become a service dog. Training at Paws With A Cause in Wayland, Michigan, unfortunately he couldn’t quite make the grade. Whenever he’d catch a whiff of something interesting, Sheldon’s concentration flew out the window and all he wanted to do was hunt down the source. But the very thing that made him a wash-out as a service dog meant he was likely perfect for another canine career. Rather than return him to civilian life, Sheldon was transferred to the State Farm Arson Dog Program, where his sensitive nose soon put him at the top of the class for sniffing out the accelerants used to light illegal fires. Paired with Lieutenant John Tadlock of the Saginaw, Texas fire department, after his graduation Sheldon went on to become the department’s premier accelerant detection canine. In his first case, Sheldon and his partner were called to a car dealership to investigate some vehicles that had been torched under suspicious circumstances. After three days, no one had been able to figure out how the fire got started—but the cause wasn’t baffling to Sheldon. “We get out of the truck and put him to work. It takes him about 30 seconds, and he gives me an alert,” Tadlock told the . “We dig through some debris and find a Molotov cocktail. It was just under some debris from the vehicle that had burned away, three days earlier. You couldn’t even see it.” But Sheldon unearthed the evidence with ease. Sheldon lives with Lieutenant Tadlock and his family (and will continue to do so even in doggy retirement). To keep their skills at the top level, the duo trains regularly on a reward/praise-based system and participates in State Farm’s annual certification program. “He made a better arson dog than a service dog,” Tadlock said. For a dog who was blessed with a super “scents-ative” sniffer, we guess whether you’re tailing bad guys or hunting up a career, it’s always best to follow your nose.

"A research team in Montreal has been busy developing a personalized anti-cancer vaccine that works in mice. At the University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre (CRCHUM), Marie-Claude Bourgeois-Daigneault and a team of scientists modify viruses to make them specific to the cells of a tumor. Once in the patient’s body, these viruses—called oncolytic viruses—infect and specifically destroy the cancer cells without touching healthy cells. These viruses can even stimulate the immune system so that it is better armed to recognize and kill malignant cells. This is what’s known as immunotherapy. In a study published in , the researchers show how they came to create an effective personalized vaccine by combining oncolytic viruses with small synthetic molecules (peptides) specific to the targeted cancer. Here, Bourgeois-Daigneault explains her team’s approach and findings. For a vaccine to induce an immune response, it has to contain elements that stimulate the cells of the immune system—the famous white blood cells. These elements, called adjuvants, are ingredients in all vaccines. They allow the human body to perceive potential danger and contain the threat by sending its army of immune cells. Our approach consists of using oncolytic viruses to stimulate this immune response and direct it towards the cancer. To succeed, we create a vaccine by mixing viruses with synthetic peptides (antigens) that resemble the targeted cancer. Because it’s true that, to be effective, the vaccine has to be personalized for each patient, based on the mutations specific to each cancer cell. Thanks to the identification work done by other research teams, we can predict what peptides to use for each patient through the information obtained from a biopsy. The advantage of our approach is that the oncolytic viruses themselves have the power to kill the cancer. We can thus attack the cancer on two fronts: kill it directly with the virus and induce an immune response, thanks not only to the virus, but to the vaccine as well. On our mice, we were able to show the efficacy of the resulting immunization. The other clinically tested personalized anti-cancer vaccines don’t use oncolytic viruses as vaccination adjuvants. Therefore, their adjuvant doesn’t have direct anti-cancer effects whereas, in our case, our viruses can destroy the cancer. An anti-cancer vaccine using oncolytic viruses is currently being tested in Canada and the U.S. However, it is not personalized. Instead, it targets certain specific cancers that have an antigen in common. By targeting this antigen, the vaccine induces an immune response. In this case, the oncolytic viruses have to be genetically modified to allow for the insertion of the antigen into the genome of the viruses. This is very different from our approach. We can target all cancers without genetic modification. A little like putting together Lego—it’s a matter of mixing synthetic peptides resembling the cancer with the chosen virus. It will be a lot easier to implement in a clinical setting. The main challenge is to identify the mutations that we want to vaccinate against. Because a cancer is unique in its tens or hundreds of mutations, but only a few of them, once targeted, will have a therapeutic effect and allow us to eliminate it. The identification of these mutations is the key step that still has to be optimized. Fortunately, many groups are working in this area.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/researchers-immunize-mice-against-aggressive-cancer/
"According to a new survey, 74% of Americans say 2020 has made them more aware of the needs of others—and more selfless than ever before. A poll of 2,005 Americans revealed that since March 2020, people are more often embracing the idea of neighborly love. Some examples include: 87% of Americans have donated a portion of their paycheck, even though three in five experienced financial difficulties. 41% have helped a stranger across the street. 38% have gone out of their way to take out their neighbor’s trash, and 31% have walked their neighbor’s dog. And, for those who live in snowy climates, one-third have shoveled out a neighbor’s car in the past year. In general, seventy-two percent said they found themselves caring about the health and well-being of others significantly more in the past year. : The survey, conducted by OnePoll in conjunction with , the charitable arm of VSP Global, aimed to discover how people are dealing with the impacts of the pandemic. “It’s been incredibly meaningful to see how the challenges of the last year have caused us to care even more for each other,” stated Pat McNeil, a spokesperson for VSP Eyes of Hope. “This study validates what we’ve been hearing from our employees and charitable partners: people are looking to better the lives of others and their communities because they envision a greater purpose after such a devastating year.” : Volunteered my time for those less fortunate – 50% Donated money to a charity – 48% Helped a stranger across the street – 41% Taken out the neighbor’s trash – 39% Shoveled out my neighbors’ car – 38% Reached out to a friend – 32% Bought something for a stranger – 19% Ultimately, while 2020 has been a difficult year for many, it’s heartening to hear that the experience has made a large majority a better person overall.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/7-in-10-say-2020-made-them-more-selfless/
"A nifty new Chrome extension uses machine learning to sort products on Amazon by their eco-friendly aspects—allowing consumers to make sustainable choices about paper mill runoff or deforestation without pouring through research on their lunch breaks. Called Finch, its ranking can be applied to the top 41 product categories on Amazon, where it ranks evaluates thousands of different products. Browser extensions are becoming as widely utilized and exciting as the App Store was for the first few iPhones. But compared to an iPhone, the operating system of a computer is much more powerful, allowing more creativity in the functioning of these add-ons. Along with sorting available information on sustainability listed on the Amazon product page itself, Finch also pulls a lot of its rankings from long, industry-specific reports on supply chains,  and self-reported data that’s designed to be reviewed by stakeholders and regulators. Finch founder Lizzie Horvitz explains that nothing scores a perfect ten, but anything above a 6.5—and the product is already having very minimal impact. She also says that sometimes it may be difficult to totally ascertain what’s the most sustainable product, since it can often be determined by how it’s used by the consumer. “What’s important to us is to show where it falls, given the relationship to the other products out there,” she tells . In terms of growing the small startup, the sky’s the limit. Finch wants to eventually rank all the categories on Amazon before moving on to other large ecommerce platforms, and eventually “any ecommerce site out there.” There’s currently a waitlist to acquire the browser extension, which isn’t featured on any digital extension marketplaces. You can join the , and while you’re at it to learn how to make the most sustainable decisions when faced with near endless choices.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/finch-browser-extension-ranks-amazon-products-by-sustainability/
"Engineers at Duke University have developed the world’s first fully recyclable printed electronics. Their recycling process recovers nearly 100% of the materials used—and preserves most of their performance capabilities for reuse. By demonstrating a crucial and relatively complex computer component—the transistor—created with three carbon-based inks, the researchers hope to inspire a new generation of recyclable electronics. “Silicon-based computer components are probably never going away, and we don’t expect easily recyclable electronics like ours to replace the technology and devices that are already widely used,” said Aaron Franklin, the Addy Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering . “But we hope that by creating new, fully recyclable, easily printed electronics and showing what they can do, that they might become widely used in future applications.” Even though the ever-growing pile of discarded electronics , less than a quarter of it each year is recycled, according to a United Nations estimate. Part of the problem is that electronic devices are difficult to recycle. Large plants employ hundreds of workers who hack at bulky devices. But while scraps of copper, aluminum and steel can be recycled, the silicon chips at the heart of the devices cannot. : In the new study, published April 26 in the journal , Franklin and his laboratory demonstrate a completely recyclable, fully functional transistor made out of three carbon-based inks that can be easily printed onto paper or other flexible, environmentally friendly surfaces. Carbon nanotubes and graphene inks are used for the semiconductors and conductors, respectively. While these materials are not new to the world of printed electronics, Franklin says, the path to recyclability was opened with the development of a wood-derived insulating dielectric ink called nanocellulose. “Nanocellulose is biodegradable and has been used in applications like packaging for years,” said Franklin. “And while people have long known about its potential applications as an insulator in electronics, nobody has figured out how to use it in a printable ink before. That’s one of the keys to making these fully recyclable devices functional.” : The researchers developed a method for suspending crystals of nanocellulose that were extracted from wood fibers that — with the sprinkling of a little table salt — yields an ink that performs admirably as an insulator in their printed transistors. Using the three inks in an aerosol jet printer at room temperature, the team shows that their all-carbon transistors perform well enough for use in a wide variety of applications, even six months after the initial printing. The team then demonstrates just how recyclable their design is. By submerging their devices in a series of baths, gently vibrating them with sound waves and centrifuging the resulting solution, the carbon nanotubes and graphene are sequentially recovered with an average yield of nearly 100%. Both materials can then be reused in the same printing process while losing very little of their performance viability. And because the nanocellulose is made from wood, it can simply be recycled along with the paper it was printed on. : Compared to a resistor or capacitor, a transistor is a relatively complex computer component used in devices such as power control or logic circuits and various sensors. Franklin explains that, by demonstrating a fully recyclable, multifunctional printed transistor first, he hopes to make a first step toward the technology being commercially pursued for simple devices. For example, Franklin says he could imagine the technology being used in a large building needing thousands of simple environmental sensors to monitor its energy use or customized biosensing patches for tracking medical conditions. : “Recyclable electronics like this aren’t going to go out and replace an entire half-trillion-dollar industry by any means, and we’re certainly nowhere near printing recyclable computer processors,” said Franklin. “But demonstrating these types of new materials and their functionality is hopefully a stepping stone in the right direction for a new type of electronics lifecycle.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/duke-unveils-first-re/
"Winner of Europe’s Leading Island Destination award for five years running, the Portuguese island of Madeira is looking to capitalize on the rise in numbers of a unique kind of traveler—digital nomads—by building a town entirely specialized for their residency. While COVID-19 has forced millions of workers into the telecommuting space, when they got there, they found the sphere was already inhabited by Anthony Bourdain-type people who travel year-round and work from their computers. Realizing this market was goosed by the rise in telecommuting, and that the staggering beauty of the island would be deeply appealing to digital nomads, Madeira has created , a place with fast internet, exclusive hotel property, community events, and a free office space. It’s situated in tranquil Ponta do Sol on the south coast, with views out to the Atlantic and a short drive from the capital of Funchal. Launched in February, for the village will run until the end of June. “Madeira Islands have the perfect conditions to attract digital nomads with its natural beauty, activities in nature, culture, and fantastic weather conditions throughout the year,” reads the village’s website. “There was an urgent need to create an integrated strategy to attract this market, in order to make Madeira also known as one of the best places in the world to work remotely.” This concept is being launched in partnership with the Government of Madeira, StartUp Madeira, and acclaimed digital nomad Gonçalo Hall. Hosting up to 100 nomads at any one time, residents must commit to staying for at least a month. Europe’s island travel market is fiercely competitive, with locations such as the Azores and their volcanoes, Sicily with its food and culture, the Greek islands with their long history, and Cyprus all battling for market share every holiday season. Madeira has nevertheless been considered as the best island destination in Europe for years. On the same latitude as Casablanca, the Portuguese outpost is home to scenery that’s both rugged and gentle—and more like the Caribbean than anywhere else on the continent, with warm seas always close by. The rich volcanic soil, mountainous terrain, and forests covering 20% of the main island serve to cloak much of Madeira in natural beauty. The forests in Madeira are unlike anything else on Earth. Laurissilva, or Laurel forest, , and an outstanding relict of a previously widespread type of forest that covered much of Southern Europe 15-40 million years ago. Now ,however, this type of forest, with 79unique species of vascular plant, is found only on the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Madeira. Madeira was referred to as the “most enviable island on Earth” by author H.N. Coleridge in the 19th century.” Well now, if you’re a digital nomad, you can live and work there today.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/madeira-portugal-digital-nomad-village-remote-workers/
"The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has just ended what’s been described as a 52-year monopoly on growing cannabis for research purposes. Several large-scale cannabis growers have now been awarded contracts to produce weed for federal research, a move that will hopefully go a long way towards proving what many state and foreign governments already know: Cannabis has , particularly for pain control. Award-winning journalist Bruce Williams the marijuana produced on the 12-acre farm at the National Center for the Development of Natural Products at the University of Mississippi—the only federally approved supplier of cannabis for research purposes in the United States—as “terrible, low-THC “schwag.” That “schwag” has led to several public relations disasters. , Johns Hopkins University pulled out of a medical cannabis trial because they requested marijuana with at least 12% THC, and couldn’t get it from the federal agency. Scientists at the Scottsdale Research Institute (SRI) involved in the trial, , said what they did receive was contaminated with mold, and “didn’t look like weed [or] smell like weed.” Another case saw a Massachusetts-based scientist against the DEA for not reviewing his application to grow marijuana for a trial for MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) and . It came out that the DEA had received 33 such applications since 2016 that it appeared to have simply shelved. However on May 14, the DEA quietly announced that it would “soon register additional entities authorized to produce marijuana for research purposes,” and that among those entities would be the SRI—who both received the moldy schwag and who actually played a large role in this change of policy. A lawsuit, Scottsdale Research vs. DOJ/DEA, brought to light that suggested the DEA’s Mississippi-monopoly was a violation of federal law, as well as to certain U.S. treaty obligations. The memo, published by the Office of Legal Council, , even in the face of repeated attempts by the legislature to reveal it and discover why, since 2016, the 33 applicants had been repeatedly ignored. Eventually, SRI’s lawsuit got the to order the DEA to respond to why it had not processed SRI’s, or the 32 other applications. Now the DEA has capitulated, recently . Matthew Zorn, an attorney who co-led the FOIA-based lawsuit, told that now scientists will be able to conduct research on the kind of cannabis that people are actually using. “A lot of people may not appreciate the importance of that, with [national cannabis] legalization around the corner,” he said to Bruce Williams. “We don’t know when, but the need for this research is urgent.

"On the 84 remote islands that make up Uganda’s Kalangala District on the surface of Lake Victoria, medical experts are tackling one of Africa’s worst provincial HIV crises with the help of cargo drones. Uganda isn’t alone in the project, as Rwanda and Ghana also use medical supply drones to reach far off communities, and together the technology promises a faster and more reliable way to deliver life-saving drugs and supplies to more than 22 million Africans. Using these drones is being called a “game changer,” and while Victoria is a lake, it’s so big that a passenger ferry needs 16 hours to cross it. Adding up the time for stops and navigation around the islands, and trying to distribute medical supplies by boat becomes an enormous undertaking. Home to around 67,000 people, Lake Victoria’s islands have an HIV incidence rate of 18%, far above the national average of 5.6%. Getting antiretroviral drugs to HIV-positive patients can prevent the virus from crippling the immune system, and the 4.5 foot wingspan of the cargo drones can carry a kilogram of these supplies at a time—to a distance of about 150 kilometers (105 miles). Developed by the and costing around $5,500 each, the drones launched last week for the first time—and will go on to supply 78 separate community groups and health facilities across the widely scattered Ssese islands, with about 200 scheduled flights per month. “Using medical drones is a huge step for us as a health sector in improving service delivery especially in hard to reach areas,” said Uganda’s director general of health services Henry Mwebesa, . “It’s very useful. Once it’s successful we can adopt it for other facilities and replicate it in other places.” “Thanks to the support and coordination of our partners, including Johnson & Johnson, this program will help gather the information and data needed to help make this future a reality, while also helping to deliver lifesaving care to people in need,” said Parkes-Ratanshi, director of the project for the Academy.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/uganda-uses-drones-to-deliver-hiv-drugs-to-remote-islands/
"For approximately four seconds on April 29, California got 95% of its power from renewable energy—with the Golden State using about 90% renewables in the afternoon hours during a period of warm, cloudless weather. While caveats such as not including Sacramento or Los Angeles in the percentage dampens the milestone, it still means over 29 million people were contributing virtually nothing towards climate change as far as their electricity needs were concerned. California follows another major population center, South Australia, . The clean energy counter also didn’t include the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, which indeed at the moment is producing nothing more than steam as emissions. Combine it with the geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass production, and 100% of the state grid was occupied with these renewables during the daylight hours. “It sends chills down my spine. It’s amazing,” said Elliot Mainzer, president and CEO of the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state’s main power grid. “These types of transitions aren’t always pretty. But we’re getting a lot of renewable generation online, making a real dent in the state’s carbon emissions,” he told the Mainzer recently urged the state to construct another 10,000 megawatts of renewables, an equivalent of one-eighth of the entire state baseload power, in order to cover the gaps in the grid that led to rolling blackouts last year. Covering gaps in renewables input is important for two reasons. The first is that electricity is the only resource that must be consumed as soon as it’s produced. That means estimations of demand more or less must always be perfect. The second is that whereby fossil fuels are by themselves a form of storage, renewables most often have no form of storage, and the electricity they generate goes into the grid immediately upon production. To help navigate around these natural flaws in renewable energy, California has been a key leader in in the west to share surplus power across state lines, creating a more robust grid, removing more need for fossil fuels, and taking advantage of other states’ resources. For example, California is much sunnier than Wyoming, but Wyoming has the most consistent wind power of any state. Utility companies in each place can exchange on the basis of covering the baseload power with the strengths of the other, and aid them with their own surpluses in return, reducing fossil fuel input and increasing grid stability. Until cost-effective and scalable storage technology is widely implemented, this is the best method for protecting against blackouts and drops in supply due to changing weather.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/california-gets-95-of-power-from-renewables-for-the-first-time-ever/
"A week after Frank O’Donnell laid his 15-year-old daughter Keri to rest, he got a backyard visit from a monarch butterfly. Its bright orange and black wings, Keri’s favorite colors, brought him an unexpected ray of solace in a dark time. Whether or not the butterfly was a cosmic messenger, O’Donnell took it as a sign Keri was reaching out to let him know her love was still there. To honor that love, O’Donnell planted a memorial garden in her name. In time, the doting dad began to so strongly identify monarch butterflies with his daughter that he started to study them. In doing so, he learned his beloved Lepidoptera species was in danger of going extinct. “Monarchs, to me, are Keri,” O’Donnell said. “I love seeing the other butterflies too, but the monarchs are what reminds me of her, just because of that one monarch that visited the week after her funeral,” he told . To do his part to prevent them from disappearing, O’Donnell started growing milkweed—monarchs’ favorite foodstuff—along with other butterfly-attracting plants in Keri’s garden. In addition to four caterpillars he found on his home turf, O’Donnell adopted a batch of monarch larvae from the conservation group . Over the course of several weeks, he raised the brood in a specially outfitted garden shed festooned with photos of Keri. In all, 27 butterflies grew to adulthood and were set free to roam the garden flora before flitting away to set off on their impressive 3,000-mile migration to Mexico. At season’s end, when O’Donnell gathered up the milkweed pods, he was left with a substantial supply of seeds. As a way to keep the monarch species and the memories of his daughter alive, he decided to share his bounty with anyone who asked. Hundreds of requests came in from across the country. For O’Donnell, every new generation of monarchs is a testament to enduring love that transcends the bonds of earth and heaven. “I guess I’ve become more spiritual, not necessarily in a religious sense, but you know, nature does a lot of stuff,” O’Donnell told the Globe. “And, I honestly do believe that she’s around.

"Hope floats. Swans’ nests do not—unless they get a little help from someone determined to make sure their precious cargo has a chance to hatch. Rob Adamson, who lives and works at Jones Boatyard in St Ives, England has been a longtime spectator to the world’s “unluckiest swans” efforts to become parents. For a decade, he looked on sadly as the poor birds’ eggs fell prey to poaching foxes and rising waters. This year as the Great Ouse began to flood, he knew he couldn’t stand by and let another clutch perish on his watch. “You’re not supposed to interfere, but it had got to the point where they were all going to die,” Adamson told the . “I couldn’t go to bed knowing that. I knew I would regret it if I didn’t do anything to save them… I needed to make sure they survived.” During the night, Adamson fashioned a makeshift raft and moored it with a line to the bank. It was well after dark when he gingerly lifted the nest and its occupants—nine eggs and one hissing mama—to safety, all under the wary eye of Papa swan. As a breed, swans have a reputation for beauty that’s only surpassed by their fierce temper. That neither of the pair attacked Adamson is unusual. Perhaps the two sensed that he was only trying to help—which would only be keeping in character since Adamson’s affinity for the majestic avians is already well established. Some years ago, Adamson famously raised an orphaned cygnet named Sid. Although he eventually made the break, when Adamson initially attempted to release Sid into the wild, his adopted offspring refused to go. Once the story made the rounds, Essex locals fittingly dubbed their neighbor “the Swan Man”—which was fine with Adamson. For him, being in tune with Mother Nature is what life’s all about. “This is why I am here, living on the water,” he told BBC. I’m in dreamland with all the wildlife… I wouldn’t swap my boat for a £10m house.” Back on the Ouse, Mama swan has settled in nicely and hopes are that the signets will hatch soon. While Papa swan remains vigilant, to further ensure the family’s safety, Adamson has erected fencing to deter predators. The swans, it seems, aren’t St Ives’ only residents grateful for Adamson’s nest-saving intervention. “It took us all by surprise when the water levels in the lower marina shot up on Saturday night,” Jones Boatyard posted to . “A HUGE thank you to Rob who noticed that the water was lapping around the swans’ nest at 9 pm. “If only the Queen knew what great service he was doing for her feathered friends!” Hmmm. ‘The Royal Order of Swan Keepers to the Crown’ does have a certain ring to it, and since technically, by law, the majority of Britain’s swans actually belong to the Queen, perhaps an elevation from ‘The Swan Man’ to ‘Sir Swan’ might be in order here?",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/unluckiest-swan-becomes-a-mom-after-crafty-raft-rescue/
"Birds are able to change their culture to become more efficient, according to new research from Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior. In animals, “culture” is considered to be any behavior that is learned from others, shared by members of the group, and persistent over generations. Cultural traditions are known to exist in many animal groups, including primates, dolphins and whales, rodents, and birds. Great tits provide a classic example of animal culture. In the 1920s, birds in a town in Great Britain were observed to open the foil tops of milk bottles to steal cream. This behavior spread over 20 years, until birds throughout the country were doing the same. In 2015 scientists experimentally confirmed that great tits were able to maintain cultural traditions. A new way of feeding—what scientists refer to as an innovation—could be taught to a single bird, and that solution would be learned by other birds and gradually spread throughout populations. But for great tits, and other animals with cultural traditions, it was still not known if groups can change. Once a tradition has taken root, are animals condemned to repeating the same behaviors or can they pivot to more efficient ones? : Now, the new study has demonstrated that more efficient behaviors can outcompete an established inefficient behavior. It pinpoints a fundamental process—population turnover—as crucial for the ability of animals to change their traditions. Published in the journal last month, the study, which involved teaching wild-caught birds to solve puzzles and fine-scale tracking of their behavior, provides quantitative support for the evolution of culture. “Experimental evidence of cultural change in animals is pretty rare, so we were surprised and excited by the outcome,” says first author Michael Chimento, a doctoral student in the Research Group of Cognitive and Cultural Ecology at the Institute. : The research team led by senior author Lucy Aplin, who is a Max Planck Research Group Leader and also a principal investigator at the Custer of Excellence ‘Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behavior’ at the University of Konstanz, studied populations of great tits caught from forests around Konstanz. Because wild great tits form changeable social groups during winter, when conditions are harshest, the scientists thought that immigration could play a part in cultural evolution. “These fluid groups could influence how their culture changes, as new group members might see solutions to problems with clearer eyes, because of their lack of experience,” says Chimento. : The researchers used captive populations of wild-caught great tits to ask how fluid social groups might change a socially learned feeding tradition. They created 18 groups of birds, each with an automated puzzle-box that gave a reward. When a bird solved the puzzle, the type of solution, time of solution, and identity were recorded using RFID, infrared, and computer vision technology. Each group had a tutor that was trained on a relatively inefficient puzzle solution, which then spread through the group. Then, half of the groups were kept static, and in the other half, group members were gradually replaced with new birds from wild over the course of 4 weeks. Despite both types of groups innovating a more efficient solution, fluid groups were much more likely to adopt it as their preferred behavior. The original residents, who were experienced with the puzzle, were generally the ones who innovated the efficient solution, but didn’t adopt it as their preferred behavior. The inexperienced immigrants, on the other hand, picked up on this innovation and did adopt it, amplifying the available social information. Birds in fluid groups were able to solve the puzzle-box faster than in static groups, despite having less overall experience. “Great tits seem to do well in and among human-made habitats, compared to other species,” says Chimento. “Our study shows how their fluid social dynamics might be part of their secret to success and contribute to their flexibility.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/birds-can-change-their-culture-to-become-more-efficient/

"A plan to give the Roman Colosseum a new floor has been approved by the Italian government—meaning visitors will soon have an opportunity to stand right where gladiators once fought. The 2,000-year-old arena hasn’t had a floor since the 19th century, when it was removed by archaeologists to reveal an impressive network of tunnels where gladiators and animals were held before rowdy events. The hi-tech floor will be wooden and sustainable, Culture Minister Dario Franceschini announced—with the engineering firm Milan Ingegneria winning the $22.2 million bid to design it. “[The floor is] another step forward toward rebuilding the arena,” Franceschini said, “an ambitious project that will aid the conservation of the archaeological structures while getting back to the original image of the Colosseum.” Intended to be completed by 2023, cultural events could take place in the Colosseum once the new floor has been completed. The design is completely reversible, and if a new one is made in the future, then the 32,200 square-foot floor could be entirely removed without damage to the ancient building. This iconic landmark of Rome dates back to the first century and the Flavian dynasty who, it seems, had a predilection for blood spots. Since then, it’s been a quarry for building materials, a place of shelter for animals, and of course, an archaeological excavation site.

Her designs have included everything from fish and chips to full roast dinners. The pharmacy technician taught herself how to make the minuscule designs four years ago by watching YouTube videos. She makes the unique items out of polymer clay by molding them into shapes. Then she uses chalk pastels, blades, and even a toothbrush to get the details before she puts them in the oven for 30 minutes where they set at home in Inverness.

"A radically reformed approach to education, in which different subjects teach connected themes, like climate change or food security, is being proposed by researchers who argue that it would better prepare children for the future. In a newly published study, education researchers from the Universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh argue that there is a compelling case for a drastic shake-up of the school curriculum, so that subjects are no longer taught independently of one another. Instead, they argue that the arts and sciences should ‘teach together’ around real-world problems, and in a manner rooted in pupils’ lived experiences. The model draws inspiration from Renaissance polymaths like Leonardo Da Vinci, who worked across disciplinary boundaries in pursuit of deeper knowledge. Similar, ‘trans-disciplinary’ approaches are already used in well-regarded education systems such as Finland’s. The idea also echoes recent calls by the youth campaign, Teach the Future, to break down subject silos to teach climate change. The academic paper, in the journal also presents evidence from two recent projects in which pupils appeared to benefit from an approach to teaching which blurred subject boundaries. One, which invited South African teenagers from disadvantaged settings to create ‘math-artworks’, produced evidence that as well as increasing their familiarity with key mathematical principles, the project also enabled pupils to understand more about the relevance of maths in their own lives. In the second case study, elementary school children in Aberdeen showed a deeper understanding of food security and environmental protection issues after learning to grow food in their school grounds. Pam Burnard, Professor of Arts, Creativities and Education at the University of Cambridge, said: “If we look at the amazing designs that Da Vinci produced, it’s clear he was combining different disciplines to advance knowledge and solve problems. We need to encourage children to think in a similar way because tomorrow’s adults will have to problem-solve differently due to the existential crises they will face: especially those of climate, sustainability… “ Dr Laura Colucci-Gray, of the University of Edinburgh’s School of Education and Sport, said: “The nature of these problems calls for a radically different approach to knowledge. We are proposing a move from the idea of a curriculum as something children are just ‘given’ to a curriculum ‘in-the-making’, in response to transformations that will define their lives.” The paper contributes to an emerging field called ‘STEAM’ education. This seeks to reinsert the ‘A’ of arts into national attempts to encourage the uptake of STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), in response to a critical skills gap in related areas of the economy. Some educationists argue that the emphasis on STEM is devaluing other subjects, and that arts disciplines are also powerful tools for delivering the problem-solving skills society needs. “For education to reflect that requires a major shift away from linear conceptions where subjects are taught separately, and towards a situation where they are inseparable,” Burnard said. In their alternative model, the researchers suggest giving schools greater freedom to determine how to meet general study targets set by the curriculum. Teachers and leadership teams would make collective decisions and share practices about how to engage pupils with unifying, cross-curricular themes, such as environmental sustainability. They add that this might also involve the imaginative use of space and resources, and closer links between schools and their communities to connect learning to pupils’ lived experiences beyond the classroom. Evidence is also emerging that a transdisciplinary approach enhances pupils’ acquisition of key skills. In the math-artwork project cited in the study, students in South Africa were asked to create art which showed the links between maths and the world around them. Subsequent analysis of the 113 submissions showed that pupils had applied principles such as measurement, ratio and proportion, and geometry in their creations. The researchers also found, however, that participants had engaged deeply with the meaning of maths at a level rarely seen in conventional lessons. One especially powerful example, by a 16-year-old male student, was entitled , inspired by Da Vinci’s . Like Da Vinci, the young artist’s work was partly a study of the proportions of the human body, but at the same time, the student used it to comment on both the potential, and dangers, of creating a society built on mathematical principles alone. Similarly, the elementary school pupils in Aberdeen showed a deepened understanding of issues like food production and natural resource management when they were given the opportunity to take responsibility for a small piece of land in their school. Researchers found that the survival of plants became personal to the pupils, rather than just an abstract concept that they had learned about in science lessons. It also introduced them to other, related ethical challenges which those lessons rarely address: such as how to produce enough food when space is limited. Any attempted reimagining of education along transdisciplinary lines would require children’s attainment to be measured differently, the researchers add. “It would require a system of testing which measures how children are internalising ideas and what they are expressing—not just what they know,” Burnard said. “That may be an uncomfortable idea for some, but it is the sort of radical thinking we need if education is going to prepare young people for the future.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/teaching-pupils-steam-cambridge-unviversity-study/

"The last 10 or 15 million years have given us some truly mega mammals, like mammoths, bears, cats, rhinos, and deer that were all much larger than their modern relatives. Now a new species of saber-toothed cat has been described by paleontologists who found the ancient cat’s humerus bone among North American museum collections. It turns out there is not one, but perhaps several other saber-toothed feline genetic branches, and would have been one of the largest felines to ever prowl the Earth. An of the humerus, which forms a part of the front leg, showed it was 1.4x as big as the same bone found in an adult male lion. The scientists then calculated the body-mass to humerus-size ratio in different species of modern cats to estimate just how big was. Depending on the species, aka ‘the’ saber-toothed cat, from 120 to 600 pounds. The newly identified cat by contrast could reach 900 pounds. Scientists have dated the bones to place the animal’s time on Earth to between 5 million and 9 million years ago, when it would have roamed the North American prairie devouring the largest game around, likely bison, but also forms of rhinoceros, and even the famous ground sloth, a colossus much bigger than any sloth species we would recognize today. “We believe these were animals that were routinely taking down bison-sized animals,” said paleontologist Jonathan Calede from Ohio State University. “This was by far the largest cat alive at that time.” Another paleontologist how surprising it was that all these specimens were collecting dust in museums around western North America. They have forearm bones, and some small teeth, but without cranial fragments or the famous saber-like teeth themselves, it would be difficult to prove beyond doubt how large they really were, and how large their prey species were. Calde that it’s “an interesting paleontological question.” “It’s been known that there were giant cats in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and now we have our own giant saber-toothed cat in North America during this period as well,” he said. “There’s a very interesting pattern of either repeated independent evolution on every continent of this giant body size in what remains a pretty hyperspecialized way of hunting, or we have this ancestral giant saber-toothed cat that dispersed to all of those continents.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/new-giant-saber-toothed-cat-species-found-that-hunted-rhinos/
"A different kind of food service app is allowing loyal customers to pay cut rates in order to rescue restaurant food before it goes into the waste bin. Too Good To Go, (get it, to go?) offers buyers a grab bag of nearly wasted, yet perfectly good food for take away as a method of cutting back on food waste and helping support the restaurant industry. “As easy as throwing it away” the simplicity of is the key to its success. Rather than other apps of a similar sort that allow customers to pick and choose which items they want to save, Too Good To Go offers only bags of whatever food the restaurants have; truer to the spirit of the enterprise, one would think. The app was among several winners of Fast Company’s 2021 World Changing Ideas Award, who reports that 40% of food in America is wasted. It’s impossible to know how much food really does end up in landfills, but it is possible to know how many meals Too Good To Go has prevented from going there. Originally available only in a few select American cities, they’ve sold 200,000 meals that were merely hours from going into the garbage. Over 1,500 restaurants have signed up in cities like D.C., New York, Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Now present in 15 countries, 150,000 orders are going out the door per day, across a user base of around 37 million people, saving a mind-boggling amount of food waste. This also is easier on the restaurants since it’s nearly impossible to guess and predict what will be available at the end of any given night. Decomposing food in landfills is a major source of methane, a short-term greenhouse gas that nevertheless could, in theory, cause climate-related damages before disintegrating after a decade. “We think we can save more than 2 million meals from the trash in the U.S. in 2021 already,” Lucie Basch, co-founder of Too Good To Go, told . “That’s thousands of tons of emissions avoided.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/too-good-to-go-food-waste-app-lets-you-save-restaurant-food/
"The potential for tapping into humanity’s CO2 emissions as a cheap and free source of carbon and oxygen is on full display with Air Company, a startup that produces premium vodka from deposited atmospheric carbon. converts CO2 into ethanol in the same way that plants use photosynthesis. The ethanol, which was originally intended for other purposes, was of such high purity that they decided to make premium spirits instead. Their bespoke vodka, sold at $75 a bottle at high-end New York City bars before the pandemic began to shut things down, is now back after winning a World Changing Idea Award from , who spoke to the founders about their invention. “We’re doing what we’re doing not just to contribute ourselves to fighting climate change, but to try to help empower other people to fight climate change in the everyday decisions that they make,” said CTO Stafford Sheehan. “And that’s one of the reasons that we target consumer goods.” Their technology of producing ethanol is now being turned towards the fragrance and perfume sector, another consumer good that needs high-purity ethanol. Carbon dioxide gets a bad rap for the greenhouse effect it causes in the atmosphere, but the its constituent elements are among the most fundamental building blocks of nature. If harvested, anthropogenic emissions can be used with modern technology to create practically anything. Air Company tech, thanks to a partnership with NASA, is being used to capture CO2, convert it into ethanol, and then into glucose—a basic sugar molecule that can be used to produce food aboard space ships, including lab grown meat.

"A new psychedelic-like ‘wonder drug’ could treat depression and post-traumatic stress disorder—without causing hallucinogenic ‘tripping’. have long shown promise for treating a host of mental illnesses, and now scientists have identified a compound that provides only the benefits. Named AAZ-A-154, it has the potential to repair chemical pathways in the brain, say the US researchers. Study co-author Dr David Olson, a chemist at University of California, Davis, explained: “One of the problems with psychedelic therapies is they require close guidance and supervision from a medical team…  A drug that doesn’t cause hallucinations could be taken at home.” Experiments using a fluorescent sensor called psychLight showed the new drug activates a gene that makes serotonin—the body’s ‘feel good’ hormone. The most common antidepressants, such as Prozac, also work by triggering the serotonin 2A receptor. The study, of AAZ-A-154—and therefore no nasty comedown. Experts believe one of the advantages of psychedelic drugs is they promote neural plasticity—allowing the brain to rewire itself. It opens the door to a medication that works in a single dose or a small number of doses, rather than having to be taken indefinitely. Mental illness affects an estimated billion people across the world, with depression being the most common type—blighting the lives of 250 million. But patients having to undergo a “psychedelic trip” raises ethical and health concerns. For example previous research has shown psilocybin, a constituent of psychedelic ‘ ‘, quickly reduces symptoms, but also causes side effects. That AAZ-A-154 comes without a ‘trip’ is hopeful news indeed, and we’ll be sure to post updates to this story as they come in.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/uc-davis-aaz-a-154-psychadelic-like-no-hallucinations/
"An incredible new bookstore uses gleaming black-tiled floors and mirrored ceilings to transform the location into a ‘never-ending’ palace of books. The magical Dujiangyan Zhongshuge bookstore, in southwest China’s Sichuan province, is home to over 80,000 volumes in more than 20,000 genres. The books stored inside the stunning store stretch from floor to ceiling—with mirrored ceilings creating the illusion that the room stretches on infinitely. All of the books are within easy reach of customers, who can ascend the bookstore’s spiral staircase and pass under towering 50-foot archways lined with yet more books, to get to the items they’d like. Laid out over two stories, and filling an area of almost 1,000 square metres, the bookstore was designed by Li Xiang, founder of Chinese architecture firm X+Living. Li said her latest project was inspired by the ancient city of Dujiangyan in which the bookstore is built. She said, “Using the technique of architecture, the designer moves the magnificent spirit of mountains and rivers into the indoor space. We present readers with their own elegant and powerful artistic landscape… a visual feast.” That vision seems to be working, with Li explaining that on entering the store, “Many people associate the space with a magical world, with the magic feeling coming from the structure of the bookshelves, and the reflection of the mirrored ceiling.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/chinese-bookstore-mirrored-ceilings-dujiangyan-zhongshuge/
"What’s the difference between having the dream and living the dream? Hard work and perseverance. Wanda Smith always wanted to be a school teacher but sometimes meeting life’s demanding realities can mean a dream deferred. A mother of three, Smith also cared for her mom. Squarely shouldering her family responsibilities, she took jobs as bus monitor and custodian for Brenham Independent School District in Texas. The hours were grueling, but rather than let her dream die, at age 37, with the support and encouragement of her husband, she added night classes to her schedule. Nine years on, she finally graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Sam Houston State University. She was a certified teacher at last. Smith’s story came full circle when she was hired as a first-grade teacher back at Brenham Elementary School. Unfortunately, her mom and beloved sisters didn’t live to see her accomplishment, but she knows they would have been proud of her. “When I stand in front of my classroom—my classroom—I am living my dream,” Smith said during a TODAY show Teacher Appreciation Day segment with Jenna Bush Hager. During the pandemic, as some of her students struggled to meet the demands of distance learning, Smith stepped up to the challenge. Noting that many of the kids she teaches come from single-parent families, she began delivering packets of schoolwork to them at home. It’s no wonder Smith’s kids adore her. In a special surprise ceremony, they shouted their praise and held up big colorful signs declaring their devotion. The sentiment was echoed by Brenham’s mayor, Milton Tate Jr, who—using one of Smith’s own signature lines—officially declared May 4, 2021 as “Be the Best You Can Be” Wanda Smith Day. The phrase was also inscribed on a commemorative schoolyard bench, and in addition, a scholarship for up-and-coming teachers at Sam Houston State has been established in her name. Smith’s life is an example as well as an inspiration. By always striving to be the best she could be, with heart and devotion she graduated from cleaning classrooms to leading classrooms—and that certainly puts her on our honor roll.

"Jonathan Bauer is afraid of heights, but that didn’t stop him from leaping off a bridge some 25 to 40 feet to the water below to save a little girl’s life. On May 2, Bauer and his teenage daughter Ava were running errands when they got caught in a serious five-car pileup on the Route 90 bridge over Maryland’s Assawoman Bay. The accident sent eight people to the hospital and left a pickup truck dangling precariously over the guardrail. After making sure Ava was okay, Bauer got out of his car to see if anyone needed help. As he headed toward the teetering truck, its passenger alerted him to a heart-wrenching sight—a toddler, ejected from the passenger side, was floating in the bay, her pink dress billowing in the waves. “I looked over and I saw the car seat, some other items, and then about six feet away from the car seat, I saw the little girl and she was on her back floating perfectly on her back, arms moving, legs kicking,” Bauer said, as reported by Scanning the water for nearby boats that might be able to help, Bauer found none close by. When he turned his attention back to the little girl, he saw she was in trouble. “She had flipped over onto her stomach and her face was in the water,” he said. Bauer yelled to his daughter to pull over the first firefighter or paramedic she saw. Then he simply peeled off his shoes and jumped in, feet first. Surfacing without injury, he swam to the toddler, who appeared to be only semi-conscious. Hefting the child over his shoulder, he patted her back until she started to cough and expel the water from her system. Moments later, boaters Joe and Alayna Oertel, who’d witnessed the events unfold, arrived. After pulling Bauer and the 2-year-old to safety, the Oertels rushed the pair to the 66th Street ramp where they were met by waiting paramedics. The little girl was airlifted to Johns Hopkins Children’s Center in Baltimore for evaluation and treatment. (She’s since been released and is expected to make a full recovery.) Bauer, overwhelmed by the experience, quietly slipped away without taking credit for his brave actions. Even after reports of the incident went public, he initially tried to keep his involvement quiet, preferring to remain an anonymous good Samaritan. His community, however, was determined to show its appreciation. They got their wish. On May 7, in a “kitchen table” press conference held at Ocean City’s Fire Station 3, Bauer was reunited with Joe and Alayna Oertel and a number of the first responders who were on the scene that day. Also in attendance, along with wife Wendi and daughter Ava, were City Council President (himself a volunteer firefighter) Matt James and Ocean City mayor, Rick Meehan. During the event, an emotional Bauer recounted his experiences of the fateful events. While he was heaped with praise and even awarded a plaque to commemorate his heroism, it was clear having saved a life was all that truly mattered. “Jonathan’s truly a humble hero and that’s what makes this even more special than it already was,” Mayor Meehan said, including Ava in his accolades as well. “This is a day of thank yous. This was a really tragic accident… [but] the ending of the story is everyone is okay, and they’re okay because of everyone in this room.” ( the TODAY video about this story below.)",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/jonathan-bauer-assawoman-bay-saves-life-toddler/
"While industries are harnessing solar, hydro, and geothermal power to solve the world’s energy problems, it’s been thought by many for sometime that the eventual source of unlimited clean energy will be nuclear fusion. Fusion reactors replicate the power and process of the sun down here on Earth by creating plasma, the fourth material state, inside a controlled device that harnesses the heat given off as energy to be turned into electricity. Now a pair of private firms, one near MIT in Boston, and another in England, are developing something that could be described as a “portable” fusion reactor, by utilizing rare minerals and some of the most powerful magnets ever made. If the firms are able to finish solving some of the most complex technological problems imaginable, coal and oil could stay in the ground, there’d be no need to risk another Fukushima, the enormous inefficiencies with renewable energies could all be forgotten, and all those engineers and technologists could lend their talents to other areas of the economy. “It’s every engineer’s dream, really, to have a project that’s technically challenging, which requires you to develop new technology and solutions to hard problems, but that are also simultaneously important for the world to have,” Dr. Greg Brittles at Tokamak Energy, the UK firm developing a new fusion reactor, told the BBC Unlike other physics equations, the fusion reactor theory is actually quite simple to explain. Hydrogen atoms go into the reactor, immense pressure causes them to fuse and become helium. Some of this hydrogen mass is converted into heat, which can be used to generate electricity. Simple. The difficulty comes with the process. In order to make fusion occur on Earth, scientists like Brittle must heat hydrogen isotopes to degrees in the hundreds of millions, at which point they break apart and form a plasma. The sun has its gravitational field to contain the plasma within it. Lacking an object 330,000 times the mass of the Earth, Tokamak Energy and other firms are planning to keep the plasma controlled with super powerful magnets. Herein lies the problem: how can you build a device that can heat and contain matter in such extremes which doesn’t just use more energy than it generates? For five years a series of power magnets wrapped with layers of superconducting tape, to be arranged in a spherical or apple-shaped fusion chamber called a tokamak. As the magnetic forces interact with one another, the pressure in the chamber builds to an incredible level—about two times more intense than at the deepest point in the ocean. The superconducting tape draws large amounts of energy from tokamak, allowing the reactor to produce more than it consumes. “It will be an assembly of many, many coils generating forces that are all interacting and pulling on one another forming a balanced set. This has to be controlled or the forces could become imbalanced,” he BBC. More of this Tony Stark-like tech, this time from America’s (CFS), is also gunning to solve the inefficiency problem. Forming a D-shape large enough for a human to stand in, powerful magnets are wrapped with 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of superconducting tape made from a barium copper oxide. This tape has taken decades to develop, and when cooled to -253 °C, which used to take a refrigerator the size of a house, it conducts nearly all of the 40,000 amps passing through the tokamak at any one time, and very efficiently. 18 of CFS’s magnets are to be arranged in this doughnut shape, similar to a particle accelerator, and their research and development team boasts that their reactor will be able to turn a glass of water into the electricity usage of one human for their entire lifetime. Government funding has gone into fusion reactors before, tens of billions of dollars in fact, but so far this haven’t solved the fundamental problems. For example, the super-intriguing international nuclear fusion research project, ITER, which funded by dozens of countries, is years behind schedule. The leviathan of metal and magnets being constructed in France by all these nations may one day be able to produce fusion, but it will be in a facility that requires many employees, with components that require gobs more rare Earth minerals, and it will be completely immobile—not to mention that humanity perhaps would require more than one such reactor. Meanwhile, this private innovation, this “race” as Kingham calls it, done with limited resources, always produces the most innovative technologies. There’s no reason to make a reactor that weighs and costs as much as a cruise ship if you can make it the size of a phone box.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/firms-making-net-producing-nuclear-fusion-reactor-technology/
"The naturalist John Muir once said, in regards to the passage of the law that protected Yosemite Valley, that as a result “every pine tree will be waving his arms for joy.” It’s lovely to think how he’d remark on the news from WWF that the regeneration of natural forests around the world has covered an area the size of France—59 million hectares—over the last 20 years. According to the various scientific and conservation groups engaged in the project, the restored forest—which was tracked using satellite data—while only being as large as France, has the potential to absorb 5.9 gigatons of carbon dioxide, more than the annual emissions of the U.S. “This map will be a valuable tool for conservationists, policymakers, and funders to better understand the multiple ways we can work to increase forest cover for the good of the planet,” John Lotspeich, executive director of Trillion Trees. “The data show the enormous potential of natural habitats to recover when given the chance to do so.” 1.2 million hectares of regrowth were seen in the forests along Mongolia’s northern border, while Canada and the central African basin were also regrowth hotspots. Additionally, the forestlands along the Atlantic coast of Brazil, second in biodiversity only to the Amazon, saw an area the size of the Netherlands return back to trees since the year 2000. All the forests being tracked are natural, and the NGOs have included in their data both areas that have needed nothing more than to be left alone to regenerate, and stands of trees that have needed active assistance to grow back. They deliberately excluded commercial plantations from the project. The resulting , which was a joint effort between WWF, Birdlife International, and Wildlife Conservation Society, is described as an exploratory one, and the contributors behind it are calling for it to be reviewed and refined. Trees are a great and inexpensive way to withdraw CO2 from the atmosphere, one of the principle aims scientists have designated for mitigating the worst effects of climate change.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/map-shows-forest-regrowth-equals-size-of-france/

"While pangolin scales, shark fins, elephant ivory, and rhino horn are famed for their value on the black market, the most illegally trafficked of them all is the rosewood tree, which generates more dollars than all four put together. Famed for quality in furniture and instruments, the advent of 3D printers has given a team of designers at San Jose State University the idea to save the tree species by 3D printing rosewood using wood scraps. Their startup, Forust, can 3D print a wood grain that mimics the properties of any kind of prized wood, whether ash, pine, or rosewood—which is due to harvesting for the Chinese luxury furniture trade, an enterprise with a global value of $95 billion. Trees, as beautiful and complex as they are, are essentially made of two products, explains Ric Fulop, CEO of Desktop Metal, the parent company of . Cellulose and lignin give wood its grain, the strings of material that run vertically up the trunk. Fulop explains that all the 3D printer does is re-construct what furniture makers work to deconstruct, by injecting a non-toxic binder with lignin onto layers of sawdust. Once finished, the resulting mock-wood can be sanded and refinished like normal timber. The Chinese market typically prizes furniture with traditional designs, that when combined with the deep red of the rosewood, a lucky color in China, indeed creates a stunning piece of furniture. Speaking with Forust say they can map incredibly complex geometric patterns and shapes onto furniture, which they can print with grain in its finished form— work that would normally take a craftsperson weeks to complete by hand. In the U.S. lignin and sawdust from the lumber industry are produced as waste to the tune of millions of tons per year, which all could go into being upcycled via 3D printing into mock luxury hardwoods. This fact actually changes the entire picture of the furniture industry, since once the material wears out it could be ground down and used again as 3D printing fuel. For circular-aiming companies like IKEA, it could be the biggest invention since particle board, and for rosewood forests around the world, it could be the most significant invention since the axe.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/stopping-the-illegal-rosewood-trade-by-3d-printing/
"They say home is where the heart is, but when the home you’re living in isn’t safe, the heartache can be a real headache. That was the situation for one Nova Scotia family—until neighbors stepped in to turn things around. When Alvero Wiggins was diagnosed with kidney failure it created a domino effect. The rigors of treatment meant spending nine hours a day on dialysis. That meant giving up work. Unable to earn a living, Wiggins, his wife, and their three children were forced to move into public housing. The hazardous conditions they faced there made for a harsh adjustment. Fortunately, Wiggins had forged strong ties to his community. Prior to his illness, he’d earned his stripes as a neighborhood activist with two local youth-related organizations, and . Sarah MacLaren had worked alongside him for years. Having seen how much of himself Wiggins invested in the pursuit of helping others, she felt he more than deserved to get something back. Finding his family a safe and healthy place to live became her top priority. This past spring, MacLaren launched a in hopes of bringing in enough money to purchase the house and defray some of the Wiggins’ living expenses. Though donations came in by the thousands, it wasn’t nearly enough to make a dent in Halifax’s red-hot housing market. While MacLaren fretted her efforts would fall short of hitting the mark, she wasn’t destined to be the only fairy godmother in this story. Enter real estate agent Brenda MacKenzie. MacKenzie heads a local housing initiative, A Home For Everyone. For the past 15 years, she and her peers have donated a portion of their commissions to various housing-related charities. For MacKenzie, who is likewise on dialysis awaiting a kidney donor, the Wiggins family’s story struck a special chord. Along with her charitable board, the decision was made that this year’s earnings would go toward helping Alvero, his wife Chelcie, and their kids Alaya, Javier, and Jaden find a new place to call home. But even with the boost in capital, hunting down an appropriate dwelling was proving to be a challenge. Yet again, fate stepped in. One of MacKenzie’s Halifax listings—a four-bedroom townhouse in close proximity to a park and swimming pool—had been inundated with multiple offers when it hit the market. All of them fell through. “Team Wiggins” rushed in with a bid, which was accepted. “This specific house was a miracle house, it was a unicorn house,” MacLaren told . “It’s probably the most beautiful thing I’ve been a part of in my lifetime.” The family expects to be able to move into their new digs by month’s end. In the meantime, A Home For Everyone has rounded up a volunteer attorney and home inspector, as well as a crew of businesses to donate a slew of home upgrades and furnishings. “It will mean everything, it will be a sense of security to live here, to have a home, to have a place to call home. My kids love it here.

"As the COVID-19 malaise slowly lifts around the world, governments are looking for quick and innovative ways to kickstart their travel industries. Portugal is building a remote worker village on the stunning island of Madeira, and now two Italian towns are paying 50% of the rental costs for remote workers looking to swap their current digs for a slice of medieval Italian rusticity. Rieti in the Lazio region, and Santa Fiora in Tuscany, are both having problems keeping young people in town, and the populations of both communes are stagnating. Maybe for coiffured Italian youths the lure of medieval walls, renaissance piazzas, and baroque palaces set amid vineyards, rivers, local markets, and chestnut forests doesn’t find purchase, but for most Americans it’s the quintessential vision of European life. And all that can be yours if you just prove to Santa Fiora mayor Federico Balocchi that you are a full-time remote worker, and that you’ll sign on for a stay greater than two months. It’s a serious government initiative, not a paid holiday, and Balocchi stressed to that the purpose is not only to bring outside money in, but to find people looking to revitalize Santa Fiora. Just cabled with high-speed fiber optic internet, Santa Fiora has only recently garnered the option to host telecommuters, or “smart workers” as the Italians call them. Nestled in the heart of Tuscany’s Montepulciano province, it’s located within the Monte Amiata Nature Reserve close to Val D’Orcia, or Dorcia Valley. Not far from Sienna, the houses are affordable, costing between €300 – €500 monthly, for which an approved remote worker would receive a check for 50% of the total, potentially transporting you from your lousy studio apartment to this dream-inspired village for around €200, or $240 per month. For investors or entrepreneurs, particularly those with Italian heritage or connections, Balocchi is also offering a €30,000 grant for those looking to open a B&B or hostel business in town, and is also willing to provide childcare assistance. Rieti, with a population of 50,000, is also witnessing a stagnation in youth opportunity and wants to invite remote workers to bring an outside perspective into the Roman-era town. An hour and a half from the Eternal City, Rieti was founded by Italian tribesmen before Rome controlled all of the peninsula, and remains from the Roman period can be found under the streets, houses, and out in the countryside. “Rents in town are in the range of €250 to €500,” explains deputy mayor of Rieti, Daniele Sinbaldi, to . “For €600 you can have an entire little villa in the peaceful countryside. Also, the voucher can be used in the entire territory of Rieti, including the rural hamlets of Sant’Elia, Cerchiara, and the skiing resort of Terminillo but we’d love to have people move in to live in the historical center.” For employees, they would need a letter from their boss that they are in fact a remote worker with enough hours and money to pay for a minimum 6-month rental (Italian lease and rental conditions are much stricter than in the U.S.) but self-employed folks only need a detailed description of their work, and some proof of income to secure rent assistance. Located on one of the most important highways in Roman times and surrounded by creeks, ponds, canals, and lakes, Rieti is known as the “fresh water Venice,” and by the less-charming “Umbilicus Italiae” or Italy’s belly-button, as they claim their historical town center is the geographical center of the country. There is no convenient website like Santa Fiora has, and perspective movers would need to use subito.it, casa.it, or immobilare.it—all Italian rental sites—to find lodging.

"Literacy skills have actually improved in the pandemic, with children reportedly picking up more challenging books and getting lost in fiction to combat isolation, a study from the UK has shown. With schools often closed, many more pupils began to enjoy reading again—with 56 percent of young people saying they enjoyed reading either very much (24 percent) or quite a lot (32 percent). During the first British lockdown, by Karen M McManus and by J.K Rowling were ranked favourite books by high school and elementary school pupils respectively. A major study by learning and assessment provider Renaissance Learning analyzed the reading habits of more than 1.1 million pupils across the UK and the Republic of Ireland, including 46,722 Scottish youngsters. The study showed reading skills have improved over lockdown periods, with many children picking up longer books of greater difficulty. The National Literacy Trust’s Annual Literacy survey of 4,141 pupils across the UK found reading for pleasure dipped at the beginning of 2020, and recorded its lowest level of self-reported reading enjoyment since 2005 (48 per cent of children). But this changed drastically with three in five children saying reading made them feel better during the lockdown. More than a third also said reading helped them when they felt sad because they could not see friends or family. Elementary school children, in particular, improved on their reading levels by focusing on more demanding texts. At Scottish elementary level and particularly year two (the equivalent of first grade), pupils were reading a larger variety of titles compared to their English counterparts. Book reading difficulty in year two was at its highest for Scottish children, who were reading books almost two years ahead of their chronological age. Professor Topping, from the University of Dundee’s School of Education and Social Work, said: “During the lockdown overall, pupils were tending to read longer books of greater difficulty and with greater comprehension. Renaissance Learning director John Moore said, “Lockdown has been difficult for many children, especially when schools were closed and they could not access school libraries or see their friends. “Knowing that reading really helped younger children to feel better throughout the pandemic is very encouraging. “It’s promising to see that when pupils had a choice of books to hand many chose a more challenging book, and one that perhaps allows for more escapism.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/childrens-literacy-up-in-pandemic-uk-study-says/
"A NASA space probe is now deep in interstellar space, and its instruments have detected an intriguing constant ‘hum’. Voyager 1—one of two sibling NASA spacecraft launched 44 years ago and now the most distant human-made object in space—still works and zooms toward infinity. The craft has long since zipped past the edge of the solar system through the heliopause— the solar system’s border with interstellar space—into the interstellar medium. There, it’s been detecting the constant drone of interstellar gas (plasma waves), according to Cornell University-led research. Examining data slowly sent back from more than 14 billion miles away, Stella Koch Ocker, a Cornell doctoral student in astronomy, has uncovered the emission. “It’s very faint and monotone, because it is in a narrow frequency bandwidth,” Ocker said. “We’re detecting the faint, persistent hum of interstellar gas.” This work allows scientists to understand how the interstellar medium interacts with the solar wind, Ocker said, and how the protective bubble of the solar system’s heliosphere is shaped and modified by the interstellar environment. Launched in September 1977, the Voyager 1 spacecraft flew by Jupiter in 1979 and then Saturn in late 1980. Travelling at about 38,000 mph, Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause in August 2012. After entering interstellar space, the spacecraft’s Plasma Wave System detected perturbations in the gas. But, in between those eruptions—caused by our own roiling sun—researchers have uncovered a steady, persistent signature produced by the tenuous near-vacuum of space, according to new research published in . “The interstellar medium is like a quiet or gentle rain,” said senior author James Cordes, the George Feldstein Professor of Astronomy. “In the case of a solar outburst, it’s like detecting a lightning burst in a thunderstorm and then it’s back to a gentle rain.” Ocker believes there is more low-level activity in the interstellar gas than scientists had previously thought, which allows researchers to track the spatial distribution of plasma—that is, when it’s not being perturbed by solar flares. Cornell research scientist Shami Chatterjee explained how continuous tracking of the density of interstellar space is important. “We’ve never had a chance to evaluate it. Now we know we don’t need a fortuitous event related to the sun to measure interstellar plasma,” Chatterjee said. “Regardless of what the sun is doing, Voyager is sending back detail. The craft is saying, ‘Here’s the density I’m swimming through right now. And here it is now. And here it is now. And here it is now.’ Voyager is quite distant and will be doing this continuously.” Voyager 1 left Earth carrying a golden record created by a committee chaired by the late Cornell professor Carl Sagan, as well as mid-1970s technology. To send a signal to Earth, it took 22 watts, according to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The craft has almost 70 kilobytes of computer memory and—at the beginning of the mission—a data rate of 21 kilobits per second. Due to the 14-billion-mile distance, the communication rate has since slowed to 160-bits-per-second, or about half a 300-baud rate. You can check out GNN’s story on that and learn how scientists have created an awesome update to help space-farers potentially find us humans here on Earth one day.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nasa-space-probe-detects-persistent-hum-voyager-1/
"A food-tech startup in upstate New York has developed technology to preserve food without refrigeration for months beyond when it would normally spoil, without the use of artificial preservatives. Poised to cut down on the millions of tons of food waste worldwide, it also has the potential to transform agriculture in developing countries where refrigerated shipping containers and trains are rare or expensive. Have you ever wondered why we don’t devote more cropland to growing fruits and vegetables instead of grain since they’re much more nutritious? The reason is food spoilage, a problem that costs $14 billion in waste in India alone. As soon as a harvest is reaped, a clock begins to tick until oxygen damage and bacteria render a product inedible. proprietary CO2 pasteurization technology is a simple fix that can prolong packaged foods’ shelf life in room temperature past 90 days. Their first demonstration, French fries, would normally need to be frozen to survive trips between production facilities and supermarkets. They can’t be pasteurized like other goods, since the rapid heating with steam would turn them into mush. Instead, Farther Farms puts them into special packaging, and fills it with supercritical CO2, preventing damage from oxidation, and suffocating bacteria. Growing up in India in a farming family, co-founder Vipul Saran developed Farther Farms as a grad student at Cornell University. His familiarity with the costs and difficulties of managing to move agricultural products, in his case potatoes, from farms into towns and cities before they spoiled informed his development of the technology. “The whole goal was, basically, how can we look into new, innovative food processing technologies that can allow us to create value-added food products from these perishable food products, which avoids the need and the dependency as much as possible on refrigeration and freezing?” Saran told Adele Peters at Rather than packaging apples or potatoes in a plastic bag, the Farther Farms tech is ideal for value-added food products, not only because they necessitate packaging of some kind, but also because they earn farmers more money, for example turning tomatoes into salsa. Rather than needing to transport them via refrigerated box car or shipping container, methods that are not only expensive, but limited in their reach to countries in Asia, Africa, and South America, Farther Farms would allow them to bypass the frozen supply chain and ship them at any temperature, thereby allowing farmers and food producers of all kinds to reach the maximal number of markets. “If you can begin producing internationally and create markets for value-added food products that don’t currently exist, you’re going to do the most to help farmers,” says Saran. Peters notes that in the States we throw out 30 million tons of food a year, and if you’ve ever pulled out a bag of freezer-burned food from the fridge that you had forgotten about, you can see how this technology would be ideal for family meal planning.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/this-co2-food-preservation-tech-can-keep-food-at-room-temperature-past-90-days/
"As companies continue to search for more environmentally regenerative materials to use in manufacturing, the tire industry is beginning to revisit an old Soviet method of rubber cultivation, using a plant that is considered a pesky weed in the West—dandelions. A major tire company in Germany has partnered with the University of Aachen to produce dandelion rubber tires in a bid to cut back on landfill waste, microplastic pollution, deforestation, and economic shortcomings related to rubber tree cultivation. While the concept of “dandelion rubber” seems like a spell waiting to happen, as mentioned previously, it was actually developed by the Soviet Union in their quest for self-sufficiency. Reporting from of a scavenger hunt across the largest country ever, and the testing of more than 1,000 different specimens before dandelions growing in Kazakhstan were found to be a perfect fit. Previously, the world used the rubber trees, mostly from Brazil, but during the Second World War the major powers of the USSR, UK, US, and Germany, were all cultivating dandelions for rubber manufacturing. : After the war ended, demand and supply gradually returned to Brazil and eventually to synthetic tires made from petrochemicals. Now, Continental Tires is producing dandelion rubber tires called Taraxagum (which was inspired by the genus name of the species, Taraxacum). The even won the German Sustainability Award 2021 for sustainable design. “The fact that we came out on top among 54 finalists shows that our Urban Taraxagum bicycle tire is a unique product that contributes to the development of a new, alternative and sustainable supply of raw materials,” stated Dr. Carla Recker, head of development for the Taraxagum project. The report from added that the performance of dandelion tires was better in some cases than natural rubber—which is typically blended with synthetic rubber. : Capable of growing, as we all know, practically anywhere, dandelion needs very little accommodation in a country or business’s agriculture profile. The Taraxagum research team at Continental hypothesizes they could even be grown in the polluted land on or around old industrial parks. Furthermore, the only additive needed during the rubber extraction process is hot water, unlike Hevea which requires the use of organic solvents that pose a pollution risk if they’re not disposed of properly. Representing a critical early-season food supply for dwindling bees and a valuable source of super-nutritious food for humans, dandelions can also be turned into coffee, give any child a good time blowing apart their seeds—and, now, as a new source for rubber in the world; truly a wondrous plant. :",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/dandelions-produce-more-sustainable-rubber/

"Scuba divers were beyond thrilled when a a group of young sea lions showed up in the water and surrounded them for a playtime of curious wonder. The beaches and rocky shores of the Galapagos Islands are home to many sea lions, and the large animals so often look and act like our lovable canine companions that they referred to as “sea dogs” or “ocean puppies”. The adult sea lions are not very interested in humans, with males being especially territorial, and weighing well over 300 pounds (150kg). They can seem quite grumpy if they are approached too closely. But the juvenile sea lions are curious and fun loving creatures that will investigate anything interesting in the water. Witness these pups suddenly surround a couple who were swimming. They were fascinated with the pair of humans who captured their shenanigans with an underwater camera. The couple dove and rolled, trying to mimic the sea lions and engage them in a game. The camera also caught the sounds of the animals as they blew bubbles and communicated, while swimming gracefully in circles around Kristy, who was delighted to join in on their wild water ballet.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/watch-sea-lion-pups-do-water-ballet-amidst-delighted-swimmers/
"As bird-lovers celebrated World Migratory Bird Day on May 8, new science had already determined that in the last half century around 3 billion birds in North America had been lost, and that two-thirds of the continent’s feathered friends today are at risk due to climate change. That’s why the Biden administration this month began a new rulemaking process to formally withdraw the Trump administration action that removed “incidental take” protections from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. According to the Audubon Society, the Biden team in March rescinded the “M-Opinion” implemented by the Trump administration, which was struck down in federal court last August, a decision that unequivocally upheld the most effective bird conservation law on the books. : The change by the Trump administration to the 100-year-old Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) was aimed at limiting the protection only to activities that purposefully kill birds, but exempting all industrial hazards from enforcement. Any “incidental” death—no matter how inevitable, avoidable or devastating to birds—became immune from enforcement under the law. If this change had been in place in 2010, BP would have faced no consequences under the MBTA for the more than one million birds killed in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. : “We hope to see the administration follow quickly with another rulemaking to establish a reasonable permitting approach for incidental take,” said Sarah Greenberger, senior vice president of conservation policy, National Audubon Society. “A permitting program is a common-sense approach to clarifying these longstanding protections and providing the certainty industry wants.” “We need a multi-front approach to ensure the MBTA remains as a strong foundation for bird protection well into the future,” , National Audubon Society. “In addition to action by the administration, we hope to see the Migratory Bird Protection Act reintroduced and passed in this Congress. Together, these actions will strengthen the MBTA from future attacks and offer stability and certainty for birds and businesses.” : A bill had been approved by a House Committee in Congress during the final two years of Donald Trump’s presidency, which had a bipartisan group of more than 90 co-sponsors, that would secure protections for birds and direct the Fish and Wildlife Service to develop a permitting process for “incidental take” to drive businesses to implement best management practices and document compliance. But this new Congress would need to begin the process again, and get a majority vote on the bill in both the House and the Senate if it wants to make its own statement that, in , “to kill a mockingbird… is a crime” when you know you can avoid it.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/biden-administration-close-to-reinstating-migratory-bird-protections/
"During the past 18 months my husband and I have come to know some extraordinary dog people, all because of a homeless puppy we rescued over two years ago in beautiful Costa Rica—a fortuitous encounter that changed our lives. Yiuka was on the street and near starvation when we found her in January 2019, driving back from a day of hiking near La Tigra. We passed several free-range dogs, a common sight there, and we started tossing some kibble when I noticed this one destitute puppy visibly struggling to wobble over to the food. She appeared to be resigned to her fate but, not knowing what to do in the moment, we just drove back to our Airbnb—but we vowed to do something. With 48 hours remaining until our flight back to Canada, we had to fast track some arrangements. Our host recommended we contact Cristina, a woman who for over 20 years has been singlehandedly caring for injured and abandoned dogs in an idyllic setting outside of town. Despite her imminent move, she agreed to take Yiuka—now we had to go find her. After three attempts to locate Yiuka where we’d first spotted her, we finally found her on the last day of our vacation. She gazed up at me with enormous brown eyes and let me gently wrap her listless body in some towels. Cristina met us at the clinic, and coincidentally the vet was on duty that weekend. Yiuka was dehydrated, full of inflammation and anemic, but at the end of her examination the vet smiled and declared “Good news! This one wants to live!” After only a few hours, I’d already lost my heart to this pitiful little stray and she managed to make me sob with relief. : We left for the airport while Cristina brought Yiuka home, pampering her with nutritious food. After sleeping for more than a week, the dog finally ventured out to meet her other canine companions, all of whom were welcoming and curious about the newcomer. Ten weeks later, we flew back to Costa Rica to check on Yiuka’s progress. Her swollen joints were almost normal and although her skin was still patchy, she was lively and playful. For that vacation, we’d randomly booked a place near the town, not really sure of its exact location. We turned off the main highway and my jaw dropped at our good fortune: our hotel was but a 5-minute walk from Cristina’s new property! In December 2019, we returned for a third time to Costa Rica and met Scott of Costa Rica Dog Rescue in the nearby tourist town of La Fortuna. He has over 20 dogs he calls his own and finds adoptive families for other homeless dogs that he rescues. He suggested we contact Save our Scruff in Toronto and they directed me to Charlie’s Angels, yet another pup refuge south of the Costa Rica capital. Our future has been radically reshaped because of a scrappy little dog that blocked our road one sunny, steamy afternoon in 2019: We intend to help and Charlie’s Angels with re-homing dogs to North America. Naturally, we can’t wait to resume our lives, support these amazing dog saviors—including Cristina (at )—and see Yiuka again before she can forgets how much she means to us!",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/starving-stray-puppy-upends-our-mundane-retired-lives/
"Our partner Rob Brezsny provides his weekly wisdom to enlighten our thinking and motivate our mood. Rob’s , is a syndicated weekly column appearing in over a hundred publications. He is also the author of . (A free preview of the book is .) Copyright by Rob Brezsny, FreeWillAstrology.com TAURUS (April 20-May 20): A fan once asked composer about his creative process. He was so prolific! How did he dream up such a constant flow of new music? Bach told his admirer that the tunes came to him unbidden. When he woke up each morning, they were already announcing themselves in his head. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, Taurus, a comparable phenomenon may very well visit you in the coming weeks—not in the form of music, but as intuitions and insights about your life and your future. Your main job is to be receptive to them, and make sure you remember them. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): “I love unmade beds,” writes Gemini poet . “I love when people are drunk and crying and cannot be anything but honest. I love the look in people’s eyes when they realize they’re in love. I love the way people look when they first wake up and they’ve forgotten their surroundings. I love when people close their eyes and drift to somewhere in the clouds.” In the coming days, Gemini, I encourage you to specialize in moments like those: when you and the people you’re interested in are candid, unguarded, raw, vulnerable, and primed to go deeper. In my opinion, your soul needs the surprising healing that will come from these experiences. CANCER (June 21-July 22): Trailblazing psychologist said his loneliness wasn’t about a lack of people around him. Rather, it came from the fact that he knew things that most people didn’t know and didn’t want to know. He had no possibility of communicating many of the interesting truths that were important to him! But I’m guessing that won’t be much of a problem for you in the coming months. According to my astrological analysis, you’re more likely to be well-listened to and understood than you have been in quite some time. For best results, ASK to be listened to and understood. And think about how you might express yourself in ways that are likely to be interesting and useful to others. LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Author tells us, “Spiritual growth involves giving up the stories of your past so the universe can write a new one.” And what exactly does it mean to “give up the stories of your past”? Here’s what I think: 1. Don’t assume that experiences you’ve had before will be repeated in the future. 2. Don’t assume that your ideas about the nature of your destiny will always be true. 3. Even good things that have happened before may be small and limited compared to the good things that could happen for you in the years to come. 4. Fully embrace the truth that the inherent nature of existence is endless transformation—which is why it’s right and natural for you to ceaselessly outgrow the old plot lines of your life story and embrace new ones. VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): In 2010, an American engineer named Edward Pimentel went to Moscow to compete in the World Karaoke Championship. He won by singing Usher’s “DJ Got Us Falling in Love.” His award: one million dumplings, enough to last him 27 years. I have a good feeling about the possibility of you, too, collecting a new prize or perk or privilege sometime soon. I just hope it’s a healthier boon than dumplings. For best results, take some time now to clearly define the nature of the prize or perk or privilege that you really want—and that will be truly useful. LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): I will love it if sometime soon you find or create an opportunity to speak words similar to what novelist once wrote to a lover: “You seem to have knit all things in a piece for me. Things are not separate; they are all in a symphony.” In other words, Libra, I’ll be ecstatic if you experience being in such synergistic communion with an empathic ally that the two of you weave a vision of life that’s vaster and richer than either one of you could summon by yourself. The astrological omens suggest this possibility is now more likely than usual. SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): “I have more memories than if I were a thousand years old,” wrote poet . Was he bragging or complaining? Did the weight of his past feel like a burden or did it exhilarate him and dynamize his creative powers? I’m hoping that in the coming weeks your explorations of your past will feel far more like the latter—a gift and blessing that helps you understand aspects of your history that have always been mysterious or murky. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Have you ever kissed a monster in your nightly dreams? Have you won a chess match with a demon or signed a beneficial contract with a ghost or received a useful blessing from a pest? I highly recommend activities like those in the coming weeks—both while you’re asleep and awake. Now is a good time to at least make peace with challenging influences, and at best come into a new relationship with them that serves you better. I dare you to ask for a gift from an apparent adversary. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): What does it mean to “follow the path with heart”? I invite you to meditate on that question. Here are my ideas. To follow the path with heart means choosing a destiny that appeals to your feelings as well as to your ambitions and ideas and habits. To follow a path with heart means living a life that fosters your capacity to give and receive love. To follow the path with heart means honoring your deepest intuitions rather than the expectations other people have about you. To follow the path with heart means never comparing your progress with that of anyone else’s, but rather simply focusing on being faithful to your soul’s code. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): “It’s a good thing when people are different from your images of them,” wrote Aquarian author Boris Pasternak. “It shows they are not merely a type. If you can’t place them in a category, it means that at least a part of them is what a human being ought to be. They have risen above themselves, they have a grain of immortality.” I love that perspective! I’m offering it to you because right now is a favorable time to show that you are indeed different from the images people have of you; that you transcend all stereotyping; that you are uncategorizable. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): You have personal possession of the universe’s most monumental creation: consciousness. This mercurial flash and dazzle whirling around inside you is outlandishly spectacular. You can think thoughts any time you want to—soaring, luminescent, flamboyant thoughts or shriveled, rusty, burrowing thoughts; thoughts that can invent or destroy, corrupt or redeem, bless or curse. There’s more. You can revel and wallow in great oceans of emotion. Whether they are poignant or intoxicating or somewhere in between, you relish the fact that you can harbor so much intensity. You cherish the privilege of commanding such extravagant life force. I bring these thoughts to your attention because the time is right for a holiday I call Celebrate Your Greatest Gifts. ARIES (March 21-April 19): In one of her poems, tells us, “The pedigree of honey does not concern the bee; a clover, any time, to him Is aristocracy.” I suggest you be like Dickinson’s bee in the coming weeks, my dear Aries. Take pleasure and power where they are offered. Be receptive to just about any resource that satisfies your raw need. Consider the possibility that substitutes and stand-ins may be just as good as the supposed original. OK? Don’t be too fussy about how pure or prestigious anything is.

"A breakthrough human trial achieved highly statistically-significant results and an excellent safety record, demonstrating that can be an effective treatment for severe and chronic Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). At the end of the randomized, blinded, Phase 3 trial, carried out by the nonprofit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), 67% of participants who received three MDMA-assisted therapy sessions no longer even qualified for a PTSD diagnosis—and 88% experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in symptoms. The treated 90 patients with severe, chronic PTSD from any cause with an average duration of 14 years, and replicated the successful results of its Phase 2 trials Study participants included patients with PTSD caused by combat-related events; accidents; abuse; and sexual harm, and 84% have a history of developmental trauma. ”While many forms of PTSD therapy involve recalling previous trauma, the unique ability of MDMA to raise compassion and understanding while tamping down fear is likely what enables it to be so effective,” says Jennifer Mitchell, Ph.D., lead author of the paper. : The peer-reviewed paper on May 10. In the first Phase 3 trial of any psychedelic-assisted therapy, participants who received the MDMA plus manual therapy reported a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms compared to those who received placebo with therapy (p<0.0001). 67% of the group who received MDMA, compared to 32% of the group who received placebo, no longer qualified for a PTSD diagnosis after three treatment sessions. In addition, participants treated with MDMA-assisted therapy had statistically significant reductions for symptoms like depression, relative to placebo with therapy (p=0.0116). “People with the most difficult-to-treat diagnoses, often considered intractable, respond just as well to this novel treatment as other study participants,” said Mitchell. “In fact, participants diagnosed with the dissociative subtype of PTSD experienced a greater reduction in symptoms than those without the dissociative subtype.” : Designed under a Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA, the trial treated 90 patients with severe, chronic PTSD. Participants were randomized to receive three sessions of either MDMA or placebo with identical talk therapy. 46 participants received MDMA therapy and 44 participants received therapy with placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was based on the change from baseline in an independently assessed clinical interview of PTSD severity after 18 weeks. The assessors also measured average change in functional impairment in work/school, social, and family life. Among the participants in the MDMA-assisted therapy group, 88% experienced a clinically significant reduction in symptoms, compared to 60% in the placebo group. In the Phase 3 trial, the investigators observed no serious safety or tolerability issues in the MDMA group. MDMA did not increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors and did not increase cardiovascular risk or abuse potential relative to therapy with placebo. As expected from previous clinical trials, temporary increases in blood pressure and pulse were observed during MDMA sessions; adverse events such as muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, sweating, and feeling cold lasted only for a short time. : PTSD researcher and author of the foundational book on PTSD, , Bessel van der Kolk served as Principal Investigator for the Boston study site. He explains, “The experience of having been traumatized profoundly alters perceptions; self-experience; and capacity to plan, imagine and anticipate. For 88% of people who receive this treatment, we can expect to see a treatment response. This can lead to fundamental shifts in our subjects’ perspective on self-capacity, affect regulation, and attitude towards those around them. These results open the door to a potentially powerful new pathway to healing.” A second Phase 3 clinical trial is in 7 different US states. Additionally, MAPS plans to conduct other studies to explore the potential of this treatment for other mental health conditions, but always stresses that this experimental therapy “necessitates the appropriate setting to truly guide change and recovery.” : Listed as a Schedule I drug, MDMA, also known as ‘ecstasy,’ is defined by the FDA as having “no medical benefit” and, therefore, is not currently accessible as a treatment for any condition, except as administered in clinical trials. Thanks to MAPS, founded 35 years ago—and their scientific rigor—this is likely to change soon. Their goal is an FDA approval in 2023 as a ‘Breakthrough-designated therapy’.

"To prevent seabirds from being caught in fishing nets, conservationists have developed an unusual aquatic scarecrow which the GNN staff summarily agreed looked just like Pixar’s WALL-E. Invented as part of a multinational effort to create innovative solutions to prevent seabird bycatch, a pair of googly-eyes mounted on a floating buoy was found to decrease the numbers of long-tailed ducks loitering around gillnets in Estonian waters by 25%. Fishing bycatch, defined as the capture of non-intended animals in fishing nets and lines, accounts for the deaths of 400,000 birds worldwide every year, something which conservationists are targeting as a preventable tragedy with different kinds of deterrents. Called the Looming Eyes Buoy (LEB), scientists at Bird Life International’s Marine Program tested it on ducks off the coast of Estonia over a 250-hour period to determine its effectiveness. Notably the birds returned when the buoys were removed, limitations. Yann Rouxel, lead author of the study reporting the results : “The development of low-cost devices such as the LEB offers up simple, yet innovative, solutions to these conservation problems and so that everybody benefits. The next step is for us to test the device in gillnet fisheries to ensure that seabird bycatch is reduced.” The WALL-E-like buoy’s next stop is the Icelandic Lumpfish fisheries and their gillnets, to see if it can continue its preventative effects on other species of birds. Gillnet bycatch of seabirds isn’t the easiest thing to prevent, and heavy-handed measures like enforced closure of fisheries or banning of nets can harshly impact developing economies, especially in Africa, that rely on the fishing industry for a large part of their national food and income. Instead scientists are opting for scarecrow tactics—low-cost solutions that allow gillnets to remain, and that won’t pile on unsustainable costs to fishermen. One solution like this in Namibia found almost perfect success through stringing brightly colored “fish scaring lines” from the backs of fishing trawlers. that a 98% reduction in albatross and other seabird deaths was observed after laws were passed requiring fishermen to attach these lines to the back of their boats. “It’s part of the brightness and then the motion of it, it’s been very very effective around the world, other nations have reported success other than Namibia,” Titus Shaanika, a Namibian conservationist and co-author of the study reporting on the scaring lines’ success,",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/looming-eyes-buoy-scares-birds-away-from-gillnets/
"A man paralyzed from the neck down has gained the ability to type words with his brain about as fast as the average smartphone user, a new study says. This “mindwriting” was done through a science-fiction sounding brain-computer interface (BCI) that picked up neural signals and fed them into an algorithm which translated them into letters. The secret to the success, and why this particular BCI was able to produce words at such a faster rate than other BCI’s in the past, was that it tracked the brain signals of the patient, known as T5, as he imagined writing them down with a pen—a skill which imprints so thoroughly on our motor skill system that it remains for years after paralysis evidently. The man was 65 at the time of the study, but it was 2007 when he suffered his spinal cord injury. “With this BCI, our study participant achieved typing speeds of 90 characters per minute with 94.1% raw accuracy online, and greater than 99% accuracy offline with a general-purpose autocorrect,” wrote the authors, whose paper can be read in To our knowledge, these typing speeds exceed those reported for any other BCI, and are comparable to typical smartphone typing speeds of individuals in the age group of our participant” Conducted by Stanford University and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the most common error the machine made was with lowercase letters of similar shapes, such as ‘r’, ‘h’, and ‘n’. At first they allowed the patient to write each letter as he would with his hand, and eventually moved to asking him questions, allowing him to write out his responses—which pleased him no end, NPR. Some BCIs and other machines that are designed to allow paralyzed people to write typically track eye movement, which is often retained even in the most extreme cases of paralysis, such as with the famous locked-in syndrome patient Jean-Dominique Bauby. Bauby is known for writing , published in 1997, which he composed entirely through the painstaking process of blinking upon an aid’s selection of the correct letter. Stanford had conducted other trials with different BCIs before, in which they used eye-monitoring equipment, but found it required tremendous attention and focus from the user. The new BCI isn’t yet developed enough to be called a prototype, meaning it will likely be years before more paralysis victims can regain their ability to communicate.

"Heroic deeds come in all shapes and sizes. Some of them require bravery in the face of danger, others result from a simple random act of compassion. Natalie Fernando was taking her 5-year-old autistic son Rudy (affectionately known as “Roo”) for a seaside walk when the little boy spiraled into a meltdown. “My son loves to walk, but he hates to turn around and walk back, we usually try to walk in a circuit to avoid this but on his favourite walk with the boats we have no choice but to turn back. This will often lead to a meltdown, one which I can normally handle but on the back of two weeks out of school today was too much for him and me,” Fernando explained on her , Better to Be Different. The promenade at Southend-on-Sea is a popular strolling spot in Essex, England. Knowing she and Rudy were drawing attention and that her son’s outburst might go on for an hour, Fernando was apologetic but she soon found herself subjected to the reproachful stares and comments of passersby. That’s when a total stranger named Ian stopped to ask if she was okay. When Fernando explained what was going on, as if it was the most natural thing in the world to do, he lay down on the ground close to Rudy and engaged him in conversation. The calming maneuver quickly turned the situation around. After Rudy recovered his composure, Ian walked Roo and his mom back to their car. “I wish there were more of this man around and I am beyond thankful,” Fernando said. “I will not forget his kindness… Thanks, Ian from Southend Sea Front, you truly are a kind man.” In addition to her gratitude, Fernando hopes Ian’s unselfish behavior might inspire others to look deeper before making social judgments themselves. “It’s said a lot at the moment, ‘In a world where you can be anything, be kind,’” she wrote. “Words are easy, these actions are not always so easy. This man is living the words and I couldn’t be more grateful. “If you see a parent struggling, maybe take the time to say, ‘Are you ok?’ Don’t judge the parenting, try not to judge the child, just be kind. “We’re all walking our own path and navigating the journey the best we can. Sometimes it takes a moment of kindness from a complete stranger to completely change your day.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/ian-helps-boy-with-autism-southend-sea-front/
"There are special caregivers in society who feel their place in the world is at the side of the bed of a dying person, helping to comfort and calm them and their family during a difficult time. Alongside the rise in these ‘death doulas’ are there to help in challenging, end-of-life moments—because making plans and doing research is often the last thing people can think to do at such a moment, and having someone to simply be present with a calming perspective, or to offer insight and information, can be a big relief. “Being a doula and a giver, is reflective of what we do,” explains Suzanne O’Brien, founder of the . “We are non-medical holistic practitioners.” Having trained over 100,000 people as doulagivers, she explains how the work “calls people forward.” “They [doulagivers] have a comfort level with those at the end of life,” says O’Brien. “It’s a relatively new movement, but it’s really picked up steam in the last few years.” Newly qualified death doula Lindsay Laubenstein was working as a manager in a not-for-profit restaurant in Cincinnati, training people with traditionally high barriers to employment to get jobs in the hospitality industry. “The restaurant industry is basically everything-proof, or at least we thought it was,” Laubenstein told me, but her place of work was ultimately impacted by the pandemic. “One morning after all the shutdowns I said: ‘I’m going to look [death doula work] up, I’m going to see what’s going on,'” she said. Laubenstein, who also described it as a “calling,” recently finished her . “I said, ‘This is it, this is what I need to be doing,'” She told me. “I’ve always felt called to death work, I’ve always felt called to the transitions in life.” How does a doulagiver go about their work? It depends on the individual doula and the client before that relationship begins, says Laubenstein. O’Brien concludes that the most important aspect is being present, adding that while modern life tends to have us living in the past and the future, on our phones, and in the digital space generally, there’s nothing more present than watching someone fade away over the space of several hours. “There are groups [like] the Threshold Choir where people go in and sing bedside to dying people,” says Laubenstein. “I could technically bring that in if someone wants me to sing to them, that’s something I could do.” It’s a special kind of person that is comfortable voluntarily spending hours with a person in their last few moments of life, and then singing to them. “Is dying a medical experience? It’s not: it’s a human one, and it’s only in the last 100 years that we’ve become so far removed from having death being a natural part of the lifecycle,” O’Brien chimes in to remind me. “It’s the hardest work I’ve ever done, and the most rewarding work I’ve ever done,” she told me. O’Brien would go on to explain that she and her institution, and the practice of death doulas as a rule of thumb, tries to avoid hospital administration or the American health insurance marketplace altogether. They prefer instead to build and resource doula programs at the community level, and harness individual doulas’ skills as private contractors, rather than lease their services to be included in a health insurance policy—as it would generally exclude lower-income families, who O’Brien feels are just as deserving of a pleasant end-of-life experience. “We’ve trained in Thailand, Zimbabwe… We had people on from Japan, Singapore, and Australia. People stay up until the middle of the night to have this webinar,” she says, referring to her online training programs. O’Brien sees this as a paradigm shift. “Dying is so expensive, but we’ve literally removed what is most effective [from end-of-life care]. Your body knows what to do… and we forget that the end of life does not have to be an embalming, a $20,000 ring-a-ma-rang.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/death-doulagivers-are-community-driven-end-of-life-specialists/
"Some kids dream of running away to join the circus—while the Ringling Bros. elephants that had been performing every night might have been dreaming about a place like this, a dream that is now coming true. 35 Asian pachyderms formerly under the care of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus are being welcomed to a 2500-acre Florida reserve where they can wander among their favorite habitats—wetlands, grasslands, or forest—and splash about in 11 different waterholes. The White Oak Conservation refuge, located in Yulee, was set up to accommodate the about-to-be retired elephants in what will become the largest herd of Asian elephants in the Western Hemisphere. The 4-square-mile refuge is the best scenario for these elephants because they’ve been raised in captivity and are not equipped to survive in the wild. “We are thrilled to give these elephants a place to wander and explore,” said philanthropists Mark and Kimbra Walter, whose family-based charity organization, , is the driving force . “It is a chance for us to let them return to just being elephants in a situation that is as close to the wild as we can make,” TWF’s Michelle Gadd explained in an interview with . After a period spent socializing to catch them up on herd and family dynamics, the first group of elephants was transported in pairs for the 200-mile journey from the Ringling Center for Elephant Conservation (CEC) in Polk County, Florida, to their new home. They got their first peak at the sanctuary on May 3, and will be joined by another group of 20 due to arrive in the near future. “Watching the elephants go out into the habitat was an incredible moment,” said White Oaks’ elephant care lead Nick Newby. “I was so happy to see them come out together and reassure and comfort each other, just like wild elephants do, and then head out to explore their new environment. Seeing the elephants swim for the first time was amazing.” “Elephants are such amazing creatures, and we are pleased to give them a place where they will flourish,” added Gadd, who oversees the Walters’ conservation efforts. “We are excited to watch them adapt to the great outdoors, tasting new plants, exploring new areas, experiencing new things.” And—for the elephants—waking up each morning in retirement is a dream that we can all get behind. a video from CBS… * : International viewers can see it .",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/circus-elephants-forever-home-florida-white-oak-conservation/
"New research suggests that among bonobos, giving is seen as good—and they may just have given the trait of generosity to us. While chimps are hostile and competitive, bonobos, their lesser-studied ape relatives, share about the same amount of DNA as us—and live in the polar opposite society of the blood-and-guts chimp dominance hierarchy. A recent paper—based on research conducted by Duke University researchers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo—found that given a plate of prized fruit and the decision to eat it all on their own, bonobos preferred to unlock an unrelated bonobo from a room with a locked door in order to share the food. Later, the researchers found that when the bonobos were in groups of three—composed of a bonobo with food, their friend, and a stranger— , followed by the friend. While humans can be more like chimps this regard, sometimes perceiving strangers as not even of the same species depending on just how far outside their group the stranger is, this bonobo beneficence of treating strangers before in-group members can be found in , or in the Roman writings on Germanic Tribes of Northern Europe like the Suebi, of whom, the historian Tacitus : “The host welcomes his guest with the best meal that his means allow… No distinction is ever made between acquaintance and stranger as far as the right to hospitality is concerned.” that the bonobo sanctuary in DRC has produced 75 published studies, as the country is the only place on Earth where bonobos can be found in the wild. Here, just as in the wild, the leader of any social circle is the female. Females keep it that way by banding together to banish aggressive males. When all is quiet, such as when it’s time to chow down, the hierarchy is enforced through sharing, cooperation, tolerance, in every capacity imaginable, though usually only for about 13 seconds. Other similarities include the simple tendency observed in both bonobos and humans to following the observation of another social group member yawning, which was suggested as being derived from empathy. It’s likely humans’ early ancestors acquired many similar strategies, as we now share and cooperate on a massive scale to accomplish things no other species has been able to do— despite the fact that we left behind many of our chimp tendencies. The research was captured well in a book co-written by the lead author of the first mentioned study, in",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bonobos-sense-of-charity-maybe-gave-humans-the-trait-generosity/
"Just because you’ve got “higher math” in your name, doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have an aptitude for arithmetic, but for 11-year-old Sanaa Hiremath, numbers are her special gift. Sanaa, who was diagnosed with autism at age 2, is so proficient at multiplication she recently took home an award from Guinness World Records (GWR) for ‘largest mental arithmetic multiplication problem’. Her parents learned their daughter was a math whiz when she was just 7 years old. The first time Sanaa was introduced to the concept of multiplication, she grasped it almost immediately. “[Sanaa] was able to instantly type in the answers for math problems—some of which I had a hard time [even] understanding the question itself!” her mother Priya told . Yet due to her autism, Sanaa failed Second Grade math at school. “They tested her on math. They gave her pencil and paper and told her to write one to 20 and she could not because she can’t hold the pencil because she has fine grip, she has poor motor issues,” Sanaa’s father, Uday, explained to , “She was different from the other kids. That was obvious—but what was not obvious was how gifted she was.” To earn her Guinness World Record, Sanaa was timed while multiplying a dozen randomly generated digits. She completed the daunting task in under 10 minutes. Perhaps the most amazing aspect of Sanaa’s gift is that she solves all of her equations strictly in her head. No paper. No pencils. No calculator. “She’s not just being a human calculator, she can actually solve complex problems,” Uday told News 9. “I don’t think she has any limitations… Six digits, seven digits, who knows how many digits. I don’t think she has those limitations.” Even so, Priya and Uday are trying to make sure the life their daughter leads is that of a normal 11-year-old—and in many ways, Sanaa is like your average pre-teen who enjoys music, swimming, and bike-riding. However, since a conventional education wasn’t suited to her special needs, it was decided home-schooling would be Sanaa’s best option. Under Priya’s tutelage, Sanaa has blossomed. Although she’s made tremendous advances, her parents prefer to keep her at grade level with her peers as they strive to maintain a cautious balance between Sanaa’s special talents and the verbal, social, and motor skills with which she continues to struggle. “Sanaa has worked every day of her life to pull herself up to where she is now,” Priya told GWR. “Whether it is her speech, gross and fine motor skills, and every little thing we take for granted in our daily lives, she has worked hard for all of those. She is now able to do things which were considered impossible during her early childhood.” Albert Einstein once said of conventional education: “Most teachers waste their time by asking questions that are intended to discover what the pupil does not know, whereas the true art of questioning is to discover what the pupil does know or is capable of knowing.” For Sanaa—and others like her—when solving the genius equation, a brilliant mind must be multiplied by unconventional wisdom—which means it’s up to the rest of us to learn to ask the right questions.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/girl-autism-earns-guinness-world-record-math-skills-sanaa-hiremath/
"An experimental form of gene therapy developed by a team of researchers from UCLA and Great Ormond Street Hospital in London has successfully treated 48 of 50 children born with a rare and deadly inherited disorder that leaves them without an immune system. Severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency, or ADA-SCID, is caused by mutations in the ADA gene that creates the enzyme adenosine deaminase— which is essential to a functioning immune system. For children with the condition, even day-to-day activities like going to school or playing with friends can lead to dangerous, life-threatening infections. If untreated, ADA-SCID can be fatal within the first two years of life. The investigational gene therapy method involves first collecting some of the child’s blood-forming stem cells, which have the potential to create all types of blood and immune cells. Next, using an approach developed by the research team, a new copy of the ADA gene is delivered into the stem cells by a modified lentivirus, or “viral vector.” The corrected cells are then returned to the child’s body, where they are intended to produce a continual supply of healthy immune cells capable of fighting infection. In a study in the , co-lead authors Dr. Donald Kohn of UCLA and Dr. Claire Booth of Great Ormond Street Hospital, or GOSH, report two- and three-year outcomes for children treated with the investigational lentiviral gene therapy in clinical trials between 2012 and 2017. “Between all three clinical trials, 50 patients were treated, and the overall results were very encouraging,” said Kohn, a distinguished professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at UCLA. “All the patients are alive and well, and in more than 95% of them, the therapy appears to have corrected their underlying immune system problems.” No complications or treatment-limiting events were reported among the patients. Most adverse events were mild or moderate, and were considered to be related to routine procedures performed in preparation for the experimental gene therapy treatment or effects of the immune system rebuilding. “Treatment was successful in all but two of the 50 cases, and both of those children were able to return to current standard-of care-therapies and treatments, with one eventually receiving a bone marrow transplant,” said Kohn, who has been working to develop gene therapies for ADA-SCID and other blood diseases for 35 years. The investigational gene therapy—a one-time procedure that the researchers say may provide lifelong results—is a welcome potential new treatment option for children with ADA-SCID, who otherwise must undergo once- or twice-weekly injections of the ADA enzyme until a matched bone marrow donor, usually a close family member, can be found. If a donor is not available, patients require lifelong injections, along with antibiotics, antifungal medications, and monthly infusions of immunoglobulin—which contains infection-fighting antibodies. These treatments are expensive and therefore out of reach for patients in many countries. “If approved in the future, this treatment could be standard for ADA-SCID, and potentially many other genetic conditions, removing the need to find a matched donor for a bone marrow transplant and the toxic side effects often associated with that treatment,” said Booth, a GOSH consultant in pediatric immunology and gene therapy.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/ucla-gene-therapy-breakthrough-children-no-immune-system/
"Childhood sweethearts have married in a real-life version of after 22 years apart—he even proposed with the engagement ring he gave her when they were 15. Helen Marshall and Graeme Richardson are both in their early forties. They met in school and admired each other from across the hallways before they fell head over heels in young love as teens. After nine months of romantic walks, school discos, and sneaking off for a wee kiss round the back of the bike sheds, young Graeme got down on one knee and proposed. But their parents worried they were too young and the engagement never happened. Graham went off to college in 1994, and the pair drifted apart. Just like the movie with Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, their letters proclaiming their lost love never reached each other, and they got on with their lives separately. Both went on to have long-term relationships and kids, and were even reunited from afar— catching glimpses of each other—when their children attended the same school. When both split up with their respective partners, Helen reached out to her first boyfriend via Facebook, and they fell in love all over again 20 years later. She discovered he had pined for her for years after their forced split, and got down on one knee again—proposing with the same ring he used more than two decades earlier, only this time they were vacationing together in Croatia. The smitten pair eloped and tied the knot last month. “We just feel so content now,” Helen said from the farm they’re now living on together. “We’re the other half of each other. I just feel like I’m home. Like I’m whole. He’s my soul mate, and I’m his.” Graeme said, “Helen’s the other half of me. She’s the opposite to me; the extravert to my introvert. It just feels like the right ending. My friends have never known me as the happy and content man I am now.” In high school Graeme was popular with the girls, and the boys all liked Helen, but neither plucked up the courage to ask each other for a date. One lucky day, a friend of Helen’s promised her a chocolate bar if she dared to ask Graeme out. Romance blossomed from day one, and grew into true love as they walked in the Lake District and sat by picturesque waters. They knew they wanted to be married, and Graeme worked hard at weekends for £3 an hour to buy her a diamond engagement ring. It’s beautiful that the ring has finally been put to use as was first intended all those years ago.

"Beyond the visual beauty of their protected landscapes, U.S. National Parks also contain natural soundscapes that have the potential to create desirable health outcomes in people. This finding is part of a large, recently published meta-analysis examining the impact of natural audio on visitors’ biomarkers—which looked at dozens of different scientific papers on the subject. When in 2018 this author arrived in Dinosaur National Monument, Utah, I saw a two-mile hiking loop called the Sound of Silence Trail. As I began walking, I took notice of the sounds, or lack thereof, around me. After just one minute of hiking over flat scrub desert, I turned back to regard my parked Nissan and watched a car pass along the road just beyond. Yet it produced no more sound than a wisp of wind in the trees—as if the desert was swallowing or buffering the outside audio from reaching me. This is just my own personal example of how the arrangement of trails, parking lots, campgrounds, and more to preserve sections of auditorily significant landscape—a topic that drove Rachel Buxton, a conservation scientist at Carleton University in Ottawa, to break from her habit of examining the stress-responses from noise pollution to the healing effects of natural sounds. In the introduction to her meta-analysis, Buxton that measured how various factors like sleep loss and disease removed “healthy life years,” from society—an interesting metric, and found that 650,000 years of life in a healthy state are lost through noise pollution—1000% more than cardiovascular disease. Sounds cause reactions in every known vertebrate, and most animal and have evolved to perceive sound as an important way of navigating the environment, finding food and mates, and avoiding danger. Therefore the obscuring of sounds by noise pollution can cause a lot of detrimental neurological effects, such as an increase in cortisol secretion that can lead to negative health outcomes. One prevailing theory over why natural soundscapes promote healing is that they usually don’t require directed attention, and can allow the sort of “switching off” of auditory focus, something that can almost never be done in the constant stimulation of an urban environment. In her , Buxton examined 36 studies, which together produced an average of a 28% reduction in feelings of annoyance when listening to natural sounds like birds, wind, and water; perhaps unsurprising. Of traditional markers of health, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and perceived pain, all of which were most strongly reduced (23%) by geophysical sounds of water. However most of the studies examined were conducted in a lab, and so in addition to a review of the literature, Buxton set out to measure the prevalence of sound in U.S. National Parks, in part to help inform park administrators—especially those in heavily visited parks—how to organize infrastructure to preserve areas of rich soundscape. “In parks, noise degrades visitor enjoyment and health directly as an environmental stressor and indirectly by altering the number of sound-producing animals and thus decreasing the diversity of natural sounds,” she wrote. However when natural sounds were audible in combination with anthropogenic noise, the negative effects of the noise pollution were largely reduced. Buxton et al. measured 221 audio recordings from 68 National Park Sites and found that 75% of them had high levels of natural sounds 75% of the time. The National Parks Service actively works to protect and maintain soundscapes. Sometimes they also work to restore them, such as in Muir Woods National Monument—where they put up signs asking visitors to “park quietly” near a particularly audio-rich area. For me these sounds are treasures,” Buxton tells . They’re amazing natural resources, and how remarkable that they are also really good for our health and our well-being.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/beyond-reducing-stress-and-annoyance-natural-sounds-can-increase-healing/
"Despite their name, there’s no bumbling in a bumblebee’s movements. They are busy surveying your yard for the tastiest and richest supplies of nectar and pollen. They’re also biting tiny chunks out of leaves as they go along, but are neither ingesting nor bringing the leaf fragments back to the hive. Instead, like so many gardeners with their pruning sheers, the bees than normal, a discovery that has scientists buzzing. Between the time of their emergence and the month of April when flowers are plentiful, buff-tailed bumblebees in a Swiss research lab were observed over several trials to prune the leaves of preferred plants while not in flower when the bee colony had been deprived of pollen. This was in contrast to the actions, both in the lab and on the building’s rooftop, of another colony that was not pollen-deprived. Additionally, they had a profound effect on the plants they pruned. Their nibbling enticed flowers out of a tomato plant a whole month early, and black mustard plants two weeks early. Continuing their rooftop research, the Swiss beekeeper/scientists found that over the course of early summer, wild bees of two other species began visiting and puncturing the leaves on non-flowering patches of plants. Such a profound development in our understanding of a well researched insect is exciting, and a collection of biologists had a lot to say to about the finding. Some suggest it was an exceptional display of communication between not just different species, but different kingdoms, as the biting of the leaves might be the bee’s way of alerting the flower to its need for food and offering its services as a pollinator in return. The question of why biting, and what is the mechanism that translates the sensation into early flowering, are still open to debate. The Swiss researchers punctured the leaves of their plants with tiny razor blades shaped like the bee-made puncture marks, and while this caused the plant to flower earlier, it didn’t happen as fast as when the bees made the marks. This suggests there could be another piece of biological equipment the bees have that works in tandem with their mandibles, perhaps an odor or scent gland. If that mechanism could be figured out, it could be the largest development in agriculture since nitrogen fertilizer, as farmers would be able to fit a lot more into a single season, and for those maintaining orchards, control when bees visit for pollination. Another hypothesis that has developed in the wake of the discovery is that if plant species change their flowering patterns in the effects of a changing climate, bees may still have the ability to manipulate their preferred plants into producing flowers in time to prevent starvation. Neal Williams, a bee biologist at UC Davis, commented how wonderful it was that even in the year 2021, such a large discovery can simply come from observing an animal in its day-to-day activities.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bees-bite-leaves-to-encourage-flower-growth/
"Six in 10 Americans have a carefully curated playlist to set the mood when taking a road trip, according to a new poll. In a survey of 2,000 Americans, results revealed having favorite tunes ready to go is so essential that they may be the ultimate make-or-break for a successful road trip. Not having access to a playlist was enough to constitute a U-turn for some: 35% of respondents would actually be willing to “turn the car around” if they don’t have everything they need to jam out to their music of choice. What songs make an appearance on the best road trip playlists? Popular choices included by Lynyrd Skynyrd (39%), by The Eagles (29%) and by Tom Cochrane (27%). In addition to the 59% who have a curated playlist, 47% said they have a road trip memory tied to a particular song. When asked to describe these music-related mementos, one respondent said, “Moving to Colorado a few years ago, heard by The National Parks for the first time and it [sort of] became an anthem to going west to start over.” Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of , the survey delved into the contents of Americans’ playlists—especially the differences between generations. Forty-two percent of respondents said they “couldn’t stand” the music their parents played on road trips growing up, and 52% believe their generation’s playlist-making skills are superior to those of other generations, with millennials most likely to agree (61%). When it comes to how respondents listen to music, enjoying albums straight through may be dead, as only 10% said they do this. Nearly half (42%) prefer to hit shuffle on their entire library and let fate determine what they’re listening to, followed by 26% who like to have a set playlist of songs. “As we began to see the number of COVID-19 cases decrease and more guests come to our stores to get their cars road-trip ready, we could feel their hope and excitement,” said Donnie Carr, President of Christian Brothers Automotive. “Their eagerness got us thinking about all the things that make car trips fun and at the top of that list is listening to great music as you drive.” Carr’s comments echo what respondents indicated, as 78% feel comfortable taking a road trip in the coming months.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/swns-onepoll-best-road-trip-songs-usa-poll-2021/
"A son has described how his mom’s Alzheimer’s disease improved as he took her traveling across the world in her final years. 44-year-old Sean O’Sallaigh initially just decided to take his mom Mary to Nepal to escape the harsh Irish winter. He was amazed when she started walking and talking again during their trip—even learning new words. So he decided to keep traveling with her for the next 18 months. Mary got to enjoy a festival of color in the Himalayas, roam across mountains in Italy, and feel the sand beneath her feet at the tip of South Africa in her final years. For Sean, it was the least he could do for the mother he loved so much—who had always given to others throughout her life. He said: “She was the best thing in my life. Unconditional love is a thing you don’t get often, and she always gave it, even though she had a tough life. “I thought Alzheimer’s was just a decline, but when we got to Nepal she started to regain capabilities. I couldn’t understand it and the doctor there told me it was all the new stimulation. Everyone wanted to talk to her and she loved it.” Before their big adventure, Sean was living mostly in his apartment in Rome and traveling for work while Mary stayed back in Dublin where Sean had grown up. He started to make more frequent visits back to Ireland to care for Mary following her diagnosis with Alzheimer’s back in 2013, when she was 77 years old. With Mary’s condition slowly worsening over the years, her neurologist told the shocked and heartbroken family not to fear, telling Sean that “positive and happy people become more so as Alzheimer’s progresses.” In Mary’s case, he was right. When the family began to discuss moving Mary into a care home by 2018, though, Sean felt very strongly it was not right for her. And that’s how the mother and son duo ended up in Nepal in February. “It was warm and she was able to go out so much,” said Sean. “We would walk by this lake and watch the children playing. They would come and sit with us at cafes and talk to her all the time and she to them. “I would take her hair brush out with us and the children would brush her hair. They called her Grandma, and she would say ‘namaste’ to everyone. We were there during a festival called ‘Happy Holi’, where they throw colored powder up in the air. They asked me if they could throw some over her and she loved it.” Then the pair went off to his apartment in Rome. There were favourite restaurants to visit and little churches she loved. And once the Italian capital got too hot? They moved to a pal’s house in the mountains of Umbria—where Mary found the cows and goats with bells around their necks “hilarious.” “Everyone she met in Italy talked to her and wanted to give her a kiss,” says Sean, “she loved it.” Then, when they moved to South Africa, Sean had a carer named Gloria help out. “She used to put Mom’s hair in lovely little plaits which she loved,” he says. Mary passed away there of a chest infection, at the age of 83, in May 2019. “I had to put my life on hold to look after her like that, but it gave me so much too,” Sean says. “People thought she would be a burden but she just never was. We had a really difficult time when I was young, and we only got through it because we had such an amazing mother.” “When I would put her into bed at night sometimes she would say, ‘you are good’ or ‘I love you’, and that was enough for me.”",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/son-mom-alzheimers-world-trip-sean-osallaigh/
"A new study has established that Intermittent Fasting is an effective means of improving long-term memory retention in mice, in what the researchers hope has the potential to slow the advance of cognitive decline in older people. The study, from King’s College London, found that a calorie-restricted diet via every other day fasting was an effective means of promoting Klotho gene expression in mice. Klotho, which is often referred to as the “longevity gene” has now been shown in this study to play a central role in the production of hippocampal adult-born new neurons or neurogenesis. Adult-born hippocampal neurons are important for memory formation and their production declines with age, explaining in part cognitive decline in older people. The researchers split female mice into three groups; a control group that received a standard diet of daily feeding, a daily Calorie Restricted (CR) diet, and Intermittent Fasting (IF) in which the mice were fed every other day. The latter two groups were fed 10% less calories than the control. Over the course of three months, the mice in the IF group demonstrated improved long-term memory retention compared to the other groups. When the brains of these mice were studied, it was apparent that the Klotho gene was upregulated, and neurogenesis increased compared to those that were on the CR diet. Dr Sandrine Thuret from King’s said: “We now have a significantly greater understanding as to the reasons why intermittent fasting is an effective means of increasing adult neurogenesis. Our results demonstrate that Klotho is not only required, but plays a central role in adult neurogenesis, and suggests that IF is an effective means of improving long-term memory retention in humans.” Dr Thuret’s previous work has demonstrated that calorie restricted diets in humans can improve memory function. That research showed that IF can enhance learning processes and could affect age associated cognitive impairment. Dr Gisele Pereira Dias from King’s explained: “In demonstrating that IF is a more effective means of improving long term memory than other calorie-controlled diets, we’ve given ourselves an excellent means of going forwards. To see such significant improvements by lowering the total calorie intake by only 10% shows that there is a lot of promise.” : The researchers now hope to recreate this study, published in journal, with human participants in order to further explore the effects of intermittent fasting—we’ll be sure to share their results as they come in.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/researchers-discover-intermittent-fasting-is-effective-at-promoting-long-term-memory-in-mice/
"Could you recognize all 50 U.S. states just by looking at the outline of their shapes? How about naming rapid-fire every element on the periodic table from glancing at the symbols? Californian Kashe Quest can do all those things—plus a whole lot more—and she’s only 2 years old. To top that off, with a lofty IQ of 146, Kashe recently became . Since the international high-IQ organization admits only the elite top 2% of the intelligentsia to its ranks, that’s a pretty staggering achievement for someone of any age—much less a toddler. Displaying advanced language skills far beyond the majority of her peers, Kashe’s parents Devin and Sukhjit Quest believed they saw early signs their daughter might be Mensa material. Her 18-month pediatric checkup confirmed their suspicions. “She has always shown us, more than anything, the propensity to explore her surroundings and to ask the question ‘Why?’” Devin told . “If she doesn’t know something, she wants to know what it is and how does it function, and once she learns it, she applies it.” In order to be able to provide the most productive learning environment for Kashe, Devin and Sukhjit decided to have her IQ tested by a psychologist. “I think the biggest takeaway from us doing it was we wanted to make sure we were giving her everything she also needed, in terms of her development and natural curiosity and her disposition—and we wanted to make sure we did our part in making that happen for her,” Sukhjit said to CNN. The Quests admit parenting a brilliant child has been a real learning experience for them as well. Devin and Sukhjit say they’ve become extremely mindful of making the best language choices when speaking with Kashe, and believe their own communication skills have greatly improved as a result. Although she’s gifted with a genius IQ, the Quests feel Kashe’s best interests will be served by continuing to let her interact with kids in her own age group. To that end, Sukhjit recently opened the Modern Schoolhouse preschool in their home. (A dozen students were enrolled in the inaugural class, and there are plans to expand to a larger facility.) While it’s too early to know if they have a future champion in their midst, right now, the Quests’ focus is on making sure Kashe has a happy, well-adjusted childhood. “She’s a toddler at heart and we want to keep that beautifulness as long as we can,” Sukhjit told 23-ABC. And that sounds like some smart parenting indeed.

"Gen Xers are folks born between 1965 and 1980. There are roughly 65.2 million of them in the United States. Brood Xers are also native to America, but this year, you can expect a population of about a trillion or so of them to show up in backyards across swaths of the mid-Atlantic and Midwest. Did we mention they’re insects? Since this year’s huge batch of Brood X cicadas is of the 17-year variety—keeping mum underground for nearly two decades, lying in wait to emerge and mate, accompanied by an exuberant and sometimes ear-shattering chorus that would have made Beethoven proud—they’re grabbing quite a lot of media attention. “This is a real treat. This is an unusual biological phenomenon. Periodical cicadas only occur in the eastern United States; they don’t occur anywhere else in the world,” entomologist Eric Day of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University extension told . “It’s just going to be an amazingly big, big show.” But the ubiquitous swarming insects aren’t just in the news, with a little help from some friends, they’re actually winning the Internet. The Fairfax, Virginia-based father/daughter team of Scott and Ellie Kanowitz have come up with a series of increasingly complex humorous vignettes starring the media-happy bugs interacting with a variety of toy props. They admit the one drawback to gently using live bug actors was that they did not always take direction well. “Posing and building more and more elaborate schemes trying to get them to stay still and learn about the cicadas was really exciting,” Scott told . “I think one thing we learned was that they don’t like to ride on skateboards.” “It was fun to try to get them to stay still and pick them up,” 11-year-old Ellie added. “I want to put them on more cars, and more miniature things.” It’s certainly the kind of family project to spark creativity, but its duration will be short-lived. The cicada’s above-ground life cycle lasts only a few short weeks. Of course, team Kanowitz could always try for a sequel… Coming soon to a device near you! “They’ll be back!” (Okay, in 17 years.) Be amused! Very amused! So then, ready to be amused by some of those cicada poses?",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/scott-ellie-kanowitz-cicadas-photos-virginia/
"Matt Stutzman was born in Kentucky without arms, and pretty much from the get-go he was in love with sports. For years Matt played basketball using his feet, but he realized he wasn’t accomplished enough to make the big league. So he pivoted towards archery, and he’s never looked back. In the London Paralympics in 2012, Matt placed an impressive silver for the U.S.A. Now, at the upcoming Summer Paralympics in Tokyo? Of course ‘The Armless Archer’ is aiming for that .

"A seven-year-old astronaut in training will become the first child ever to send something to the moon after impressing the world’s leading space pioneers. Elizabeth Norman is obsessed with space and staged the launch of a massive homemade Vulcan Centaur rocket from her garden earlier this year. Her enormous enthusiasm for all things lunar captured the attention of US experts currently prepping the real Vulcan Centaur for the first moon landing in nearly 50 years. United Launch Alliance (ULA) has a miniscule space left on an upcoming mission to send the first ever private pod to land on the lunar surface. They’ve offered to take something belonging to ‘Astro Liz’, and now a sticker carrying the name of her space blog will be part of the first ever lunar ‘time capsule’. Her family, who are from Leicester in England, have even been invited to wave it goodbye on launch day in Florida at the end of 2021. The schoolgirl is one of a handful of people in the world to include a personal item on the first ever mission of its kind. And she’s already doing her own astronaut’s physical training routine to prepare for a future in space, to one day go visit the moon—and her sticker—in person. Elizabeth said: “I can’t wait to see a video of the capsule with my sticker on the moon taken by the lunar lander. “Astrobotic is making my space dreams come true and I’m so excited to watch the launch… I love science and space because there is so much to learn and I love exploring and doing experiments.” Her future goals? “To walk on the moon and to explore the highest mountain on Mars.” Proud mom Jennifer Norman said: “None of us could believe it when we found out she would have the opportunity to make her mark on the Moon… For her to be included in such a historic moment is incredible and has shown anything is possible—her confidence and ambition have grown so much since she found out. Elizabeth’s passion for space took off after watching coverage of NASA’s Perseverance Rover being sent to Mars in July 2020. She threw herself into learning all about space—Elizabeth has already built a bionic arm to learn about robotics, and has just completed a five-week NASA program where she designed and carried out her own virtual mission to Mars. She even set up a in July last year, where she uploads educational videos. Her work caught the eye of Tory Bruno, the CEO of ULA, and lunar lander manufacturer Astrobotic. He watched the launch of her seven-foot cardboard version of the rocket he’s currently prepping for launch—as it sailed 30ft into the air, impressing Elizabeth’s neighbors. So impressed, he reached out and asked if she could be part of the real launch of Astrobotic’s Peregrine lunar lander on board ULA’s Vulcan Centaur when it takes off later this year. As part of the mission, space technology company Astrobotic is offering people and businesses the chance to buy space on the lander—known as a lunar payload: NASA is paying $79.5 million for 14 slots on the mission. Elizabeth couldn’t be more excited about the upcoming launch—after all, if anyone knows the sky is far from the limit, it’s her.",https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/elizabeth-norman-ula-item-joining-private-trip-to-the-moon/
"A generous couple has been secretly stuffing money into diaper boxes and under formula canister lids at local Targets in order to help out struggling families.
